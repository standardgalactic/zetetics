GRADUATE TEXTS IN PHYSICS
Graduate Texts in Physics publishes core learning/teaching material for graduate- and
advanced-level undergraduate courses on topics of current and emerging ﬁelds within
physics, both pure and applied. These textbooks serve students at the MS- or PhD-level
and their instructors as comprehensive sources of principles, deﬁnitions, derivations,
experiments and applications (as relevant) for their mastery and teaching, respectively.
International in scope and relevance, the textbooks correspond to course syllabi sufﬁciently
to serve as required reading. Their didactic style, comprehensiveness and coverage of
fundamental material also make them suitable as introductions or references for scientists
entering, or requiring timely knowledge of, a research ﬁeld.

Preface to the Second Edition
The ﬁrst edition of this textbook had found a friendly acceptance. This second
edition does not change the concept of the representation which combines the ex-
perimental techniques for the investigation of atoms and molecules and their results
that have lead to the development of quantum physics. Some new developments
in laser physics and quantum optics have been inserted in Chapter 12 in order to
give the reader some ideas about the frontiers in these ﬁelds regarding experimental
techniques and physical insight.
This second edition represents a thoroughly revised version of the ﬁrst edition,
which, unfortunately, contained a lot of errors and misprints. I am grateful to many
readers who have informed me about such errors and who offered corrections and
improvements of the representation for a better understanding. I am particularly in-
debted to Dr. Nico Dam, Raboud University Nijmegen, Netherland and Prof. Zamik
Rosenwaks, Ben Gurion University, Israel, who have sent me an extensive correction
list.
The author hopes, that this new edition will be well accepted and that critical
readers will send their comments or ideas about possible improvements.
I thank Dr. Th. Schneider, Springer Verlag for his continuous interest and
encouragement.

Preface to the First Edition
The detailed understanding of matter, its phase transitions and its interaction with ra-
diation could be only reached, after its microscopic structure determined by the kind
of atoms or molecules as basic constituents of matter had been investigated. This
knowledge allowed the controlled optimization of characteristic properties of mat-
ter. Atomic physics therefore represents not only an area of important fundamental
research, but has furthermore many applications which have essentially formed our
present technical world. The understanding of materials and their use in daily life,
has major impact of our culture and our attitude towards nature and our environment.
This textbook is aimed as an introduction to the microscopic world of atoms,
molecules and photons. It illustrates how our knowledge about the microscopic struc-
ture of matter and radiation came about and which crucial experiments forced an
extension and reﬁnement of existing classical theories, culminating in the develop-
ment of quantum theory, which is now accepted as the basic theory of atomic and
molecular physics.
The book therefore starts with a short historical review about the role of ex-
periments for correcting erroneous ideas and proving the existence of atoms and
molecules. The close interaction between experiments and theory has been one of the
reasons for the rapid development of atomic physics in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Examples are the kinetic theory of gases, which could be completely understood by
the assumption of moving atoms in the gas, or the postulation of energy quanta in the
radiation ﬁeld, which could explain the discrepancy between measurements of the
spectral energy distribution of thermal radiation ﬁelds and classical electrodynamics.
The new ideas of quantum physics and their corroboration by experiments are
discussed in Chap. 3 while the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics and
their applications to some simple examples are explained in Chap. 4.
A theory can be best understood by applications to a real situation. In Chap. 5 the
quantum theory of the simplest real system, namely the hydrogen atom, is presented.
Here it is again illustrated, that experiments enforced an extension of quantum me-
chanics to quantum electrodynamics in order to understand all experimental results.
The description of larger atoms with many electrons is treated in Chap. 6, which also
reduces the chemical properties of chemical elements to the structure of the electron
shells and explains why all elements can be arranged in a periodic table.
The important subject of interaction of matter with radiation is discussed in
Chap. 7. This prepares the ground for the explanation of lasers, treated in Chap. 8.
Molecules, consisting of two or more atoms, form the basis for the great variety
of our world. They are discussed in Chaps. 9 and 10. In particular the question, why
and how atoms can form stable molecules, and which kind of interaction occurs,

VIII
Preface to the First Edition
is treated in more detail. In Chap. 11 the different experimental techniques for the
investigation of atoms and molecules are presented, in order to give the reader a feel-
ing for the inventive ideas and the necessary experimental skill for their realization.
The last chapter presents a short overview on recent developments in atomic and
molecular physics, which shall demonstrate that physics will be never a complete
and ﬁnalized ﬁeld. There is still much to explore and new ideas and scientiﬁc enthu-
siasm is needed, to push the border of our knowledge further ahead. Some examples
in this chapter also illustrate possible important applications of new ideas such as
the quantum computer or new techniques of frequency metrology used in the world
wide global positioning system GPS.
Many people have helped to publish this book. First of all I would like to thank
the team of LE-TeX, who have made the layout. In particular Uwe Matrisch, who has
looked after the editing process and who has taken care of many handwritten remarks
and corrections of the author with great patience. Dr. Schneider from Springer-Verlag
has always supported this project, although it took longer as anticipated.
Many thanks go to all colleagues who have given their permission to reproduce
ﬁgures or tables.
This book is an extended version of volume 3 of a German textbook consisting
of 4 volumes. The authors hopes, that it will ﬁnd a comparable good acceptance as
the German version. He will be grateful for any reply of readers, giving corrections
of possible errors or hints to improvements. Any of such replies will be answered
as soon as possible. A textbook lives from the active collaboration of its readers and
the author looks foreward to a lively correspondence with his readers. He hopes that
this book can contribute to a better understanding of this fascinating ﬁeld of atoms,
molecules and photons.

1. Introduction
This book deals with the microscopic building blocks
of matter: atoms and molecules. These are the smallest
particles responsible for the characteristic properties
of gases, liquids and solids. Although with modern
techniques they can be split into still smaller parti-
cles, such as electrons, protons and neutrons, these
latter “elementary particles” do not bear the character-
istic features of the speciﬁc macroscopic body formed
by atoms or molecules. We will discuss in detail in
this textbook how the diversity of macroscopic bod-
ies and their properties are related to their composition
of atoms and molecules. We will, however, restrict the
treatment to free atoms and molecules because a de-
tailed discussion of the microscopic structure of solids
would increase the size of this book beyond reason.
A very important issue of atomic physics is the in-
teraction of atoms and molecules with electromagnetic
radiation, which can be absorbed or emitted by these
particles. Photons, or “energy quanta,” are the con-
stituents of electromagnetic radiation and are created or
annihilated by matter. They therefore form an essential
part of the microscopic world.
“Classical physics” was already a well-established
closed theory at the end of the 19th century and could
explain nearly all aspects of ﬁelds such as mechanics,
electrodynamics and optics. Only the theory of relativ-
ity and the physics of nonlinear phenomena, leading to
the discovery of chaos, were later developed.
On the other side, most of the discoveries about
atoms and molecules were made during the 20th cen-
tury and even the last decade brought us still many
surprises in atomic and molecular physics. The rea-
sons for this relatively late development of atom-
ic physics are manifold. First of all, the objects in
this ﬁeld are very small and cannot be viewed by
the naked eye. Many sophisticated experimental tech-
niques had to be invented ﬁrst in order to gain reliable
information on these microparticles. Furthermore it
turned out that classical theories were not adequate to
describe atoms and molecules and their interactions.
After a new theory called “quantum theory” was de-
veloped in the ﬁrst three decades of the 20th century,
a rapid progress in atomic and molecular physics took
place, and our knowledge on this ﬁeld increased ex-
plosively. Nevertheless there are still a large number
of open questions and poorly understood phenome-
na that await their solutions by future generations of
researchers.
1.1 Contents and Importance
of Atomic Physics
Atomic physics deals with the structure of atoms, their
mutual interaction and their dynamics, i.e., their time-
dependent properties. The goal of experimental and
theoretical efforts in this ﬁeld is the full understanding
of macroscopic properties of matter on the basis of its
microscopic composition of the constituent atoms and
a quantitative description of the relations between mi-
croscopic and macroscopic features. We will later see
that this goal has, besides its essential contribution to
fundamental physics and a new concept of nature, an
enormous inﬂuence on technical applications.
At the beginning of the 20th century, when atomic
physics started to develop as an original ﬁeld, it was
regarded as pure fundamental science, with no practi-
cal application. Lord Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937),
one of the pioneers of early atomic physics, wrote as
early as 1927, after the discovery of possible transfor-
mations of atoms through impact by energetic particles,
“Anyone who expects a source of power from transfor-
mation of atoms is talking moonshine.” This point of
view has radically changed. Besides the quite intensive

1. Introduction
fundamental research in atomic physics, the number
of scientiﬁc and technical applications has increased
enormously.
The methods developed in atomic physics are
meanwhile used routinely in chemistry, biology,
medicine and industry. In particular the instruments in-
vented during research work in atomic physics, such
as the X-ray tube, the electron microscope, the oscil-
loscope, spectrometers, tomographers, lasers etc., are
now indispensable tools in other scientiﬁc ﬁelds or for
the solution of technical problems.
The importance of atomic physics is therefore not
restricted to physics. Atomic physics, together with
molecular physics, forms the foundations of chem-
istry. It explains the chemical properties of atoms
and the order of elements in the periodic table,
the binding of molecules and the molecular struc-
ture. Chemical reactions are reduced to collisions
between atoms and molecules. Because of its impor-
tance, a new branch of chemistry called “quantum
chemistry” has been established, which deals with the
theoretical foundation of chemistry based on quan-
tum theory. The famous natural philosopher Georg
Christoph Lichtenberg (1742–1799) wrote, “Someone
who only knows chemistry does not really understand
it either.”
The complex reactions in the earth’s atmosphere are
started by the interaction of sunlight with atoms and
molecules leading to energy deposition in molecules,
their
ionization
and
dissociation
into
fragments.
Collisions between these particles can further increase
the number of possible chemical reactions. The reac-
tion probability depends not only on the temperature
but also on the internal energy and structure of the col-
lision partners. A more detailed understanding of these
processes and the inﬂuence of man-made pollutant sub-
stances on such processes is of crucial importance for
the survival of mankind [1.1–5].
During recent years the molecular basis of bio-
logical processes has been widely investigated. New
experimental techniques of atomic physics have been
applied to the studies of living cells and the reac-
tions proceeding inside a cell. It is now possible to
follow the paths of single molecules intruding a cell us-
ing spectroscopic methods of high spatial and spectral
resolution [1.6–8].
Also in medicine, many diagnostic tools are bor-
rowed from atomic physics and even therapeutic meth-
ods, such as speciﬁc laser treatment of cancer or
irradiation with particle beams, are based on investi-
gations in atomic physics.
The development of star models in astrophysics has
gained important stimulation from laboratory experi-
ments on absorption and emission of radiation by atoms
or ions, on recombination processes between free elec-
trons and ions or on lifetimes of excited atoms and on
collision processes between electrons, ions and neu-
tral atoms and molecules. Besides high-energy physics,
atomic physics has considerably contributed to a better
understanding of the formation of stars, on radiation
transport and on the structure of star atmospheres
[1.9–10].
Atomic physics has also played an essential role
for the optimization of modern technical developments.
One famous example is the rapidly increasing mani-
fold of lasers and their various applications [1.11].
Modern illumination techniques with energy saving
lamps, discharge tubes or light emitting diodes are
essentially applied atomic physics [1.12–13]. New pro-
cedures for the nondestructive inspection of materials
or for the enhancement of catalytic reactions on sur-
faces are based on results of research in atomic physics.
For many technical developments in the production
of semiconductor chips, such as the controlled diffu-
sion of impurity atoms into the semiconductor or the
interaction of gases and vapors with solid surfaces,
which are processes studied in atomic physics, play
an essential role [1.14, 15]. Without exaggeration, one
may therefore say that atomic physics has an impor-
tant share in the development of modern technology
and this will certainly increase even more in the future.
For metrology the measuring techniques developed
in atomic physics have increased the achievable ac-
curacy by several orders of magnitude [1.16]. With
laser spectroscopic methods, for example, the abso-
lute values of fundamental physical constants, such as
the Rydberg constant, the ﬁne structure constant or the
ratio me/mp of electron mass to proton mass, could
be measured with such high precision that the ques-
tion of whether these “constants” are really constant
or change slightly with time over millions of years
can now be attacked experimentally with measurement
times of a few years.
The central importance of atomic physics for many
other ﬁelds is schematically illustrated by the block
diagram in Fig. 1.1.
Besides its inﬂuence on the technological devel-
opment, atomic physics and quantum theory have

Fig. 1.1. The central role of atomic physics
essentially contributed to a modern view of nature
that replaces the former mechanistic concept of our
world [1.17]. The belief of a strict separation be-
tween matter and energy had to be modiﬁed by the
recognition that both manifestations of nature are in-
terchangeable and the anticipation of a strict causality
for all processes in our surrounding has now been lim-
ited by the uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics.
Maxwell’s daemon of classical physics, who could ex-
actly predict the future outcome of events as long as he
knew the initial conditions sufﬁciently accurately, has
to be replaced by probability statements, since the exact
knowledge of all initial conditions is not possible. The
deterministic view of nature, where all future events
were already determined by the present conditions
had to undergo a critical revision. This change in the
concept of nature has considerably inﬂuenced philos-
ophy and epistemology, i.e., the theory of knowledge,
and has induced hot discussions about the question of
whether objective cognition is possible independent of
the thinking subject [1.18].
These few examples should have illustrated the im-
portance of atomic physics for our modern world and
why it is therefore worthwhile to study this fascinating
ﬁeld in more detail.
1.2 Molecules:
Building Blocks of Nature
In nature we ﬁnd 92 different elements that correspond
to stable atoms. These atoms can form larger enti-
ties, called molecules. The smallest molecules consist
of two atoms, such as H2, N2, O2, NaCl, etc., while
large molecules (for instance proteins or DNA) are
composed of many thousands of atoms (Fig. 1.2).
The large variety and the manifold of species in
nature is due to the huge number of possible combi-
nations of these 92 stable atoms to form molecules.
The chemical and therefore the biological properties of
these molecules depend on:
•
The speciﬁc kind of atoms they are composed of.
•
The spatial structure of the molecules, i.e., the
way in which the atoms are arranged within the
molecule.
•
The binding energy of atoms or atomic groups in
the molecule.
•
The stability, depending on the heights of the en-
ergy barrier, that has to be overcome to change the
geometrical structure of the molecule.
Only recently has it become possible to calculate
the structure and the binding energies of small- and
medium-sized molecules by ab initio methods using
fast computers. In many cases, however, experimental

1. Introduction
methods are still indispensable because sufﬁciently ac-
curate calculations surpass the capacity of even large
computers.
The goal of such investigations is a better knowl-
edge of molecular structure and the potential surfaces
that determine this structure and the relevant bind-
ing energies. In recent years the dynamics of excit-
ed molecules, i.e., the way the energy, pumped into
a molecule (for example by absorption of light), is dis-
tributed within the molecule over the course of time,
has attracted more and more interest from researchers.
With a time resolution of a few femtoseconds (1 fs =
10−15 s) obtained with ultrashort laser pulses, it is now
possible to observe the motions of atoms in molecules
in real-time and to gain much information on molec-
ular dynamics, such as dissociation or isomerization.
This allows one to follow more closely the atomic pro-
cesses in chemical reactions. In special cases it is even
possible to control such reactions, i.e., to enhance want-
ed reaction channels and to suppress unwanted ones.
This opens the way for controlled synthesis of larger
molecules from smaller constituents.
Many biological processes, such as energy pro-
duction in living cells, photosynthesis, ion migration
through cell walls, signal transport in nerves or the time
sequence of the visual process from the illuminated
retina in the eye to the recognition of the light image
in the brain, can now be studied in more detail due to
advanced experimental techniques developed in atomic
physics [1.19].
The experimental and theoretical molecular physics
therefore gains increasing attention for many ﬁelds in
modern chemistry and biology. In many laboratories,
researchers are working on the ambitious goal of un-
raveling the structure and the arrangement of different
amino acid molecules in large biomolecules, to un-
derstand their role in genes and to clarify the genetic
code and its relevance for the characteristic features of
life [1.20–22].
1.3 Survey on the Concept
of this Textbook
The goal of this textbook is to facilitate the un-
derstanding of the structure and dynamics of atoms
and molecules by starting from basic concepts and
experimental facts in atomic and molecular physics. It
is also interesting to learn a little bit about the way our
present knowledge has developed. Therefore, a short
historical review is ﬁrst provided about the successive
improvement of the atomic concept, which has led to
more and more reﬁned atomic models. In particular,
the experimental key investigations resulting either in
the conﬁrmation, modiﬁcation or even change of ex-
isting theories are discussed in order to give a better
appreciation for the skill and imagination of earlier
researchers.
The most important theoretical approach for the
description of the microworld is certainly the develop-
ment of quantum physics during the ﬁrst three decades
of the 20th century. We will discuss in Chap. 3 the
basic experimental results that forced a correction of
classical physics. Then the basic features of quantum
physics, particle-wave duality, the uncertainty relation
and its experimental veriﬁcation are presented and the
probability concept for describing processes in the
microworld is explained.
In Chap. 4 we then introduce the formal rep-
resentation of quantum mechanics, in particular the
Schrödinger equation and its application to some sim-
ple problems, in order to illustrate differences to and
similarities with classical physics.
In Chap. 5 the simplest of all atoms, the hydrogen
atom is treated with the tools acquired in the foregoing
chapters. Here we can learn about many features that
are also relevant for other atoms but can be calculated
more accurately for the H atom because it is the on-
ly system for which the Schrödinger equation can be
solved exactly. Even here, new characteristic features
such as the spin of the electron, resulting in the ﬁne
structure of the measured spectra could not immediate-
ly be explained and demanded the broadening of the
quantum theory and the development of a new branch
of quantum physics, called quantum electrodynamics.
Chapter 6 deals with atoms consisting of more
than one electron, where new phenomena occur, which
are related to the Coulomb repulsion between the
electrons and to the fact that electrons cannot be dis-
tinguished from each other. The treatment of many-
electron systems is illustrated by the example of the
two-electron helium atom and is then extended to larger
atoms.
The absorption and emission of light by atoms

of atoms, on the possible atomic energy levels and
on dynamical processes in excited atoms. This al-
so includes X-rays, which are discussed in Chap. 7.
After treating the interaction of electromagnetic ra-
diation with atoms, we have laid the fundaments
for the understanding of lasers. Their basic principle
and their various technical realizations are presented
in Chap. 8.
In Chap. 9 we start the discussion of the basic
physics of molecules. The simplest stable molecules,
the H+
2 ion (two protons and one electron) and the
H2 molecule (two protons and two electrons) serve as
examples to explain the nomenclature and the princi-
ples of theoretical approximations for the description
of diatomic molecules. Both examples illustrate the ori-
gin of the chemical binding of atoms forming a stable
molecule. While for small atomic distances in a di-
atomic molecule the quantitative treatment of chemical
binding demands quantum theory, at large distances the
binding energy is small and can be treated by clas-
sical methods, which will be also discussed in this
chapter.
The most important source of information on
molecular structure is provided by molecular absorp-
tion and emission spectra, which are discussed in more
detail in Chap. 10. We start with diatomic molecules
and treat polyatomic molecules in Chap. 11.
The chapter following is devoted to experimen-
tal techniques in atomic and molecular physics. Here
we will illustrate how all knowledge of atomic and
molecular structure discussed in the foregoing chap-
ters has been achieved by experimental results and how
experiment and theory supplement each other to efﬁ-
ciently achieve optimum progress in our understanding
of the microscopic structure of matter. The last chap-
ter of this text books treats some modern developments
of modern atomic physics, such as optical cooling of
atoms, Bose-Einstein condensation of free atoms, time-
resolved molecular dynamics on the femtosecond time
scale and some fundamental experiments in quantum
optics.
For a more detailed study of the subjects presented
in this textbook the reader is referred to the literature
given in the corresponding sections. Besides modern
treatments, sometimes the original historical papers on
new discoveries are also cited. This provides the read-
er direct access to the way new ideas came about and
to the original interpretations of experimental results,
which, although often ingenious, did not always agree
with our present point of view, since our ancestors did
not have all of facts now available to us. Nevertheless
the study of this original papers will give us some ad-
miration of the inspiration and brilliance of the early
researchers


2. The Concept of the Atom
Our present knowledge about the size and internal
structure of atoms is the result of a long develop-
ment of ideas and concepts that were initially based
both on philosophical speculations and on experimen-
tal hints, but were often not free of errors. Only during
the 19th century did the increasing number of de-
tailed and carefully planned experiments, as well as
theoretical models that successfully explained macro-
scopic phenomena by the microscopic atomic structure
of matter, could collect sufﬁcient evidence for the re-
al existence of atoms and therefore convinced more
and more scientists. However, even around the year
1900, some well-reputed chemists, such as Wilhelm
Ostwald (1853–1932), and physicists, e.g., Ernst Mach
(1838–1916), still doubted the real existence of atoms.
They regarded the atomic model as only a working hy-
pothesis that could better explain many macroscopic
phenomena, but should not be taken as reality.
In this chapter we will therefore discuss, after
a short historical survey, the most important ex-
perimental proofs for the real existence of atoms.
Furthermore, some measurements are explained that
allow the quantitative determination of all atomic char-
acteristics, such as their size, mass, charge distribution
and internal structure. These experiments prove with-
out doubt that atoms do exist, even though nobody has
ever seen them directly because of their small size.
2.1 Historical Development
Historically, the ﬁrst concept of the atomic structure
of matter was developed by the Greek philosopher
Leucippus (around 440 B.C.) and his disciple Demo-
critus (460–370 B.C.) (Fig. 2.1), who both taught that
all natural bodies consist of “inﬁnitely small” particles
that completely ﬁll the volume of the bodies and are not
Fig. 2.1. Democritus (∼460–370 BC) (from K. Faßmann:
Die Großen, BD I/2, Kindler-Verlag, Munich)
further divisible. They called these particles “atoms”
(from the Greek word atomos = indivisible). Outside
the atoms there is only the empty space (a vacuum).
Different atoms differ in size and shape and the char-
acteristic properties of matter are, according to this
model, due to different arrangements of equal or of
differing atoms. All observable changes in the macro-
scopic world are caused by corresponding changes in
atomic composition. Atom movements and collisions
between atoms create and modify matter.
We meet here for the ﬁrst time the idea that the
properties of macroscopic bodies can be explained by
the characteristics of their constituents. This hypoth-
esis, which comes close to our modern concept of
atomic physics, had been an extension and reﬁnement

2. The Concept of the Atom
of former ideas by Empedocles (490–430 B.C.), who
believed that everything is composed of the four ele-
mental constituents: ﬁre, water, air and soil.
The concept of Democritus represents in a way
a symbiosis of the different doctrines of pre-Socratic
philosophers. First, the static hypothesis of Parmenides
(around 480 B.C.) about the never-changing eternal
existence of the world and secondly the dynamical doc-
trine of Heraclitus (around 480 B.C.), which stresses as
the most important point the evolution instead of the
static nature of things, since everything changes with
time (nobody can submerge twice into the same river
as the same man, because the river, as well as the man,
is changing in time).
According to Democritus, atoms represent static
nature while their movements and their changing com-
position explain the diversity of matter and its time
evolution.
The famous Greek philosopher Plato (427–347
B.C.) pushed the abstraction of the concept further. He
used the hypothesis of the four “elements” ﬁre, water,
air, and soil but attributed to these elements four reg-
ular three-dimensional geometric structures, which are
formed by symmetric triangles or squares (Fig. 2.2).
Fire is related to the tetrahedron (four equilateral trian-
gles), air to the octahedron (eight equilateral triangles),
water to the icosahedron (20 equilateral triangles), and
the soil, particularly important to mankind, to the cube
(six squares or 12 isosceles triangles). Plato’s ideas
therefore reduced the atoms to mathematical structures
that are not necessarily based on the real existence of
matter. These “mathematical atoms” can change their
characteristics by changing the arrangement of the ele-
mental triangles. This is, according to Plato, equivalent
to the observable evolution of matter.
Aristoteles (384–322 B.C.), a student of Plato, did
not accept this concept of atoms since it contradicted
his idea of a continuous space ﬁlled with matter. He
Fig. 2.2. The platonic bodies
also did not believe in the existence of empty space
between the atoms. His inﬂuence was so great that
Democritus’ hypothesis was almost abandoned and
nearly forgotten until it was revived and modiﬁed lat-
er by Epicurus (341–271 B.C.), who attributed atoms
not only size but also a mass to explain why bodies fell
down.
After Epicurus the atomic theory was forgotten for
many centuries. This was due to the inﬂuence of the
Christian church, which did not accept the material-
istic view that everything, even human beings, should
be composed of atoms, because this seemed to be in
contradiction to the belief in God as the creator of bod-
ies and soul. There had occasionally been attempts to
revive the atomic idea, partly induced by Arabic scien-
tists, but they did not succeed against church suppres-
sion. One example was the Prior Nikolaus of Autrecourt
in France, who was forced in 1348 to “withdraw” his
newly developed atomic concept.
The large shortcoming of all these philosophical hy-
potheses was the lack of experimental guidance and
proof. They were more speculative.
The real breakthrough of modern atomic physics
was achieved by chemists in the 18th century. They
found for many chemical reactions, by accurately
weighing the masses of reactants and reaction products,
that their results could be best explained by the hypoth-
esis that all reactants consist of atoms or molecules that
can recombine into other molecules (see below).
Besides this increasing amount of experimental
evidence for the existence of atoms, the atomic hy-
pothesis won a powerful ally from theoretical physics
when James Prescott Joule (1818–1889), Rudolf Julius
Clausius (1822–1888), James Clark Maxwell (1831–
1879), and Ludwig Boltzmann (1884–1906) developed
the kinetic theory of gases, which could derive all
macroscopic quantities of gases, such as pressure, tem-
perature, speciﬁc heat, viscosity, etc., from the assump-
tion that the gas consists of atoms that collide with each
other and with the walls of the container. The temper-
ature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the
atoms and the pressure represents the mean momen-
tum the atoms transfer to the wall per second per unit
wall area. The ﬁrst ideas about the kinetic theory of
gases and its relation to heat were published by John
Herapath (1790–1868) in a book, which was known to
Joule.

2.2. Experimental and Theoretical Proofs for the Existence of Atoms
9
Quantitative information about the size of atoms
and their internal structure, i.e., mass and charge distri-
bution inside the atoms was only obtained in the 20th
century. The complete theoretical description was pos-
sible after the development of quantum theory around
1930 (see Chaps. 3 and 4).
In the Chronological Table at the end of this book
one ﬁnds a compilation of historical landmarks in
the development of atomic physics. For more detailed
information on the history of atomic and molecular
physics the reader is referred to the literature [2.1–6].
2.2 Experimental and Theoretical
Proofs for the Existence of Atoms
Before we discuss the different experimental tech-
niques developed for the proof of atoms, a general re-
mark may ﬁrst be useful. The objects of atomic physics
are not directly visible since they are much smaller
than the wavelength of visible light, unlike bodies in
the macroscopic world. Therefore, indirect method for
their investigation are required. The results of such ex-
periments need careful interpretation in order to allow
correct conclusions about the investigated objects. This
interpretation is based on assumptions that are derived
from other experiments or from theoretical models.
Since it is not always clear whether these assump-
tions are valid, the gain of information in atomic
physics is generally an iterative process. Based on
the results of a speciﬁc experiment, a model of the
investigated object is developed. This model often al-
lows predictions about the results of other experiments.
These new experiments either conﬁrm the model or
they lead to its reﬁnement or even modiﬁcation.
In this way, through collaboration between ex-
perimentalists and theoreticians, a successively
reﬁned and correct model can be established that
reﬂects the reality as accurately as possible.
This means that it allows correct predictions for all
future experimental results. This will be illustrated by
the successive development of more and more reﬁned
models of the atom, which will be discussed in the
following sections and in Chap. 3.
2.2.1 Dalton’s Law of Constant Proportions
The ﬁrst basic experimental investigations that have
lead to a more concrete atomic model, beyond the
more speculative hypothesis of the Greek philosophers,
were performed by chemists. They determined the
mass ratios of the reactants and reaction products for
chemical reactions. The basic ideas had already been
prepared by investigations of Daniel Bernoulli (1700–
1782), who explained the experimental results of the
Boyle–Marriotte Law:
p · V = const
at constant temperature
by the movements of tiny particles in a gas with vol-
ume V which exert the pressure p onto the walls
around V through collisions with the wall. These ideas
laid the foundations of the kinetic gas theory, which
was later more rigorously developed by Clausius,
Maxwell, and Boltzmann.
Following the more qualitative ﬁndings of Joseph
Louis Proust (1754–1826) on mass ratios of reac-
tants and reaction products in chemical reactions, the
English chemist John Dalton (1766–1844) (Fig. 2.3)
recognized, after many experiments of quantitative
analyses and syntheses for various chemical com-
pounds, that the mass ratios of reactants form-
ing a chemical compound, are always the same
for the same reaction, but may differ for different
reactions.

2. The Concept of the Atom
EXAMPLES
1. 100 g of water are always formed out of 11.1 g of
hydrogen and 88.9 g of oxygen. The mass ratio of
the reactants is then 1 : 8.
2. 100 g of copper oxide CuO contains 79.90 g Cu and
20.10 g oxygen with a mass ratio of about 4 : 1.
3. Some reactants can combine in different mass ra-
tios to form different products. For example, there
are ﬁve different manganese oxides where 100 g of
manganese combines either with 29.13 g, 43.69 g,
58.26 g, 87.38 g or 101.95 g of oxygen. The differ-
ent amounts of oxygen represent the mass ratios
2 : 3 : 4 : 6 : 7.
From these experimental results Dalton developed
his atomic hypothesis in 1803, which stated that the
essential feature of any chemical reaction is the recom-
bination or separation of atoms. He published his ideas
in the paper “A New System of Chemical Philosophy”
[2.7], which contains the three important postulates:
•
All chemical elements consist of very small
particles (atoms), which can not be further
divided by chemical techniques.
•
All atoms of the same chemical element have
equal size, mass and quality, but they differ
from the atoms of other elements. This means
that the properties of a chemical element are
determined by those of its atoms.
•
When a chemical element A reacts with an
element B to form a compound ABn (n =
1, 2, . . .) each atom of A recombines with one
or several atoms of B and therefore the num-
ber ratio NB/NA is always a small integer.
Dalton’s atomic hypothesis can immediately ex-
plain the experimental results given in the above ex-
amples:
1. Two hydrogen atoms H recombine with one oxygen
atom O to form the molecule H2O (Fig. 2.4). The
observed mass ratio 11.1/88.9 is determined by the
masses of the atoms H and O. From the mass ratio
m(H)/m(O) = 1/16 (see Sects. 2.2.2 and 2.7), the
measured mass ratio of the reactants follows as
m(H2)/m(O) = 2/16 = 11.1/88.9 .

2. For the reaction Cu + O →CuO the mass ratio
of the reactants corresponds to the relative masses
m(Cu)/m(O) = 64/16 = 4 : 1.
3. The different manganese oxides are MnO, Mn2O3,
MnO2, MnO3, and Mn2O7. Therefore, the num-
ber of O atoms that combine with two Mn atoms
have the ratios 2 : 3 : 4 : 6 : 7 for the different com-
pounds, which is exactly what had been found
experimentally.
Since Dalton’s laws only deal with mass ratios and
not with absolute atomic masses, the reference mass
can be chosen arbitrarily. Dalton related all atomic
masses to that of the H atom as the lightest element.
He named these relative masses atomic weights.
Note:
“Atomic weights” are not real weights but dimension-
less quantities since they represent the ratio m(X)/
m(H) of the atomic masses of an atom X to the
hydrogen atom H.
Jörg Jakob Berzelius (1779–1848) started to accu-
rately determine the atomic weights of most elements
in 1814. Nowadays this historic deﬁnition of atomic
weight is no longer used. Instead of the H atom the
12C atom is deﬁned as reference. The atomic weight
has been replaced by the atomic mass unit (AMU)
1 AMU=(1/12) m(12C)=1.66053886 × 10−27kg.
All relative atomic masses are given in these units.
EXAMPLES
The mass of a Na atom is m(Na) = 23 AMU, that
of Uranium 238 is m(U) = 238 AMU and that of the
nitrogen molecule N2 is 2 × 14 = 28 AMU.

2.2.2 The Law of Gay-Lussac
and the Denition of the Mole
Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) and Alexander
von Humboldt (1769–1859) (Fig. 2.5) discovered in
1805 that the volume ratio of oxygen gas and hydro-
gen gas at equal pressures was always 1 : 2 when the
two gases recombined completely to form water vapor.
Further detailed experiments with other gases lead to
the following conclusion:
When two or more different gases completely re-
combine to form a gaseous chemical compound,
the ratio of the volumes of reactands and reac-
tion products at equal pressure and temperature
is always given by the ratio of small integer
numbers.

EXAMPLES
1. 2 dm3 hydrogen gas H2 and 1 dm3 oxygen gas O2
recombine to form 2 dm3 water vapor H2O (not
3 dm3 H2O as might be naively expected!).
2. 1 dm3 H2 and 1 dm3 Cl2 form 2 dm3 HCl gas.
Amadeo Avogadro (1776–1856) (Fig. 2.6) explai-
ned these results by introducing the deﬁnition of
molecules:
A molecule is the smallest particle of a substance
that determines the properties of this substance.
It is composed of two or more atoms.
Referring to the experimental results of Gay-Lus-
sac, Avogadro concluded:
At equal pressures and temperatures, the same
volume of different gases always contains the
same number of molecules.
With this hypothesis the two preceding examples
are described by the reaction equations:
2 H2 + O2 →2 H2O ,
H2 + Cl2 →2 HCl .
The total mass M of a gas with volume V containing
N molecules with mass m is then:
M = N · m .

2. The Concept of the Atom
The mass ratio M1/M2 of equal volumes of differ-
ent gases at equal pressure and temperature therefore
equals the mass ratios m1/m2 of the corresponding
molecules, since the number N of molecules is the
same for both gases.
It is convenient to introduce a speciﬁc reference
quantity of molecules, called one mole [1 mol]. The
volume occupied by one mole of a gas is called the
mole volume VM. The deﬁnition of a mole is as follows:
1 mol is the quantity of a substance that con-
tains the same number of particles (atoms or
molecules) as 0.012 kg of carbon 12C.
This deﬁnition is equivalent to: 1 mol of atoms
or molecules with atomic mass number X AMU has
a mass of X grams.
EXAMPLES
1. 1 mol helium He ˆ= 4 g helium
2. 1 mol oxygen O2 ˆ= 2 · 16 g = 32 g oxygen
3. 1 mol water H2O ˆ= (2 · 1 + 16) g = 18 g water
4. 1 mol iron oxide Fe2O3 ˆ= (2 · 56 + 3 · 16) g=160 g
iron oxide
The number NA of atoms or molecules contained in
1 mol is the Avogadro constant. Its experimental value
is
NA = 6.0221415(10) × 1023 mol−1 .
From the hypothesis of Avogadro the statement fol-
lows:
Under standard conditions (p = 1000 hPa, T =
0 ◦C) 1 mol of an arbitrary gas always occupies
the same volume VM, called the mole volume:
VM = 22.710981(39) dm3 mol−1 .
Note:
The value of VM depends on the deﬁnition of the stan-
dard conditions. There are two sets of these conditions
in use: The old one uses
a) T = 273,15K (00C) and p = 1atm (1013.25hPa) →
VM = 22,413996 dm3mol−1
The new one, adapted in the CODATA list and
NIST reference tables uses:
b) T = 273,15K (00C) and p = 1bar (1000hPa) →
VM = 22.710981 dm3mol−1
2.2.3 Experimental Methods for the Determination
of Avogadro’s Constant
Since the Avogadro constant NA is a fundamental
quantity that enters many basic physical equations, sev-
eral experimental methods have been developed for
the accurate measurement of NA [2.8]. We will only
present some of them here.
a) Determination of NA
from the general equation of gases
From the kinetic theory of gases the general equation
p · V = N · k · T
(2.2)
can be derived for the volume V of an ideal gas un-
der the pressure p at a temperature T , which contains
N molecules. Here k is the Boltzmann constant. For
1 mol of a gas with volume VM, N becomes NA and
(2.2) converts to
p · VM = NA · k · T = R · T .
(2.3)
The gas constant
R = NA · k
(2.4)
is the product of Avogadro’s and Boltzmann’s con-
stants. It can be determined from (2.3) when p, VM
and T are measured. If the Boltzmann constant k and
the gas constant R can be measured independently, the
Avogadro constant NA can be determined from (2.4).
α) Measurements of the gas constant R
The gas constant R can be obtained from measure-
ments of the speciﬁc heat. The internal energy of 1 mol
is
U = f · 1
2kT · NA = 1
2 f · R · T ,
(2.5)
where f is the number of degrees of freedom of the
atoms or molecules of the substance. For example

2.2. Experimental and Theoretical Proofs for the Existence of Atoms
13
f = 3 for atoms, f = 3 + 2 = 5 for diatomic mole-
cules at low temperatures where the vibrations are not
excited and f = 7 at higher temperatures.
The molar speciﬁc heat Cv for a constant mole
volume of a gas is
Cv =
∂U
∂T

v
= 1
2 f · R .
(2.6)
This is the energy that increases the temperature of
1 mol of a gas by 1 K and can therefore be readily mea-
sured, giving the value of R, if the number of degrees
of freedom f is known.
Another way to measure the gas constant R is based
on the difference
R = Cp −Cv
(2.7)
of the molar speciﬁc heats Cp at constant pressure and
Cv at constant volume.
The most accurate determination of R uses the
measurement of the velocity of sound waves vs in an
acoustic resonator (Fig. 2.7). A spherical volume is
ﬁlled with argon at a pressure p and temperature T .
A small loudspeaker S produces sound waves that
lead to resonant standing waves if the sound frequen-
cy matches one of the radial eigenfrequencies f0,n ∝
vs/λ0,n with λ0,n = r0/n of the spherical acoustic res-
onator with radius r0. These resonantly enhanced sound
waves are detected by a microphone Mi. The frequen-
cies f0,n of different resonances are measured. As is
outlined in the solution of Problem 2.6, the gas constant
is related to the measurable acoustic eigenfrequencies
f0,n, the sound velocity vs, the molar speciﬁc heats Cp
and Cv, the temperature T and the volume V by
R = M · v2
s
T · κ = M
T
f 2
0,n · r2
0
κ · n2 ,
(2.8)
where M is the molar mass and κ = Cp/Cv [2.9]. Since
the acoustic losses of the spherical resonator are low,
the resonances are very sharp and the resonance fre-
quencies f0,n can be determined with high accuracy.
Tuning the loudspeaker-frequency through several res-
onances from n = 1 to higher values the squares f0,n2
of the resonance frequencies can be plotted against n2
which gives a straight line with the slope RκT/(Mr02).
Since M and κ are known and T and r0 can be accu-
rately measured, the gas constant R can be determined
[2.9].

β) Measurement of the Boltzmann Constant
The Boltzmann constant k was ﬁrst determined in 1906
by Jean Baptiste Perrin (1870–1942). He observed the
vertical density distribution n(z) of small latex parti-
cles in a liquid within a glass cylinder (Fig. 2.8). At
equilibrium the Boltzmann distribution
n(z) = n(0) · e−m∗gz/kT
(2.9)
is obtained, where m∗g = (m −ϱL · Vp)g is the ef-
fective weight of a particle with volume Vp, (i.e., its
real weight minus its buoyancy in the liquid with
density ϱL). This gives the gradient
dn
dz = −n(z) · m∗· g
k · T
,
(2.10)
The mass m of the particles can be determined by mea-
suring their size (volume) under a microscope and their
density with standard techniques.

Fig. 2.8. Stationary distribution n(z) of small particles in
a liquid
Counting the number of n(z) yields dn/dz and
therefore the Boltzmann constant from (2.6). The rather
tedious counting can be avoided by the following con-
sideration. Due to gravity the particles sink down. If the
gravity force
Fg = (m −ϱL · Vp)g
(2.11a)
is just compensated by the friction force
Ff = −6πηrv ,
(2.11b)
which spherical particles of radius r experience when
they fall with the velocity v in a medium with viscosi-
ty η, the net force is zero. The constant sink velocity is
then
vg = (m −ϱL · Vp) · g
6πηr
where
Vp = 4
3πr3 .
(2.12)
The downward ﬂux of particles jg = vg · n creates
a concentration gradient dn/dz, which leads to an
upward diffusion ﬂux
jdiff = −D · dn
dz = D · n · (m −ϱL · Vp)g
k · T
,
(2.13)
where D is the diffusion coefﬁcient.
Finally, stationary conditions are reached when
both ﬂuxes just cancel. This means
jdiff + jg = 0 ⇒k = 6πηr · D
T
.
(2.14)
Therefore, the Boltzmann constant k can be de-
termined from the measurements of viscosity η,
diffusion coefﬁcient D, temperature T , and the
radius r of the spherical particles.
The most accurate method to measure k will be
discussed in Sect. 2.3.1.
b) Direct Determination of Avogadro’s Constant
From measurements of the absolute mass m of atoms X
(see Sect. 2.7) and the molar mass MX (i.e., the mass
of a gas of atoms X within the molar volume V =
22.4 dm3 under normal conditions p and T ) the
Avogadro constant
NA = MX/mX
can be directly determined.
The molar mass MX can be also obtained for
nongaseous substances from the deﬁnition
MX = 0.012 mX/m(12C) kg
when the absolute mass of the carbon atoms m(12C) is
measured (see Sect. 2.7).
c) Determination of Avogadro’s Constant
from Electrolysis
Another method for the determination of NA is based
on Faraday’s law for electrolytic processes. It states that
the electric charge
F = NA · e = 96,485.3383(83) C/mol
(2.15)
is transported to the electrode in an electrolytic cell,
when 1 mol of singly charged ions with mass mX and
elementary charge e has been deposited at the elec-
trode. Therefore, weighing the mass increase Δm of the
electrode after a charge Q has been transferred, yields:
Δm = Q
e mX = Q

of silver nitrate the transport of charge F means a

m(Ag) at the negative electrode, which can be mea-
sured by weighing the cathode before and after the
charge transport. With the atomic mass number of
silver AM(Ag) = 107.89 AMU the Avogadro number
NA = 107.89 AMU

(2.16b)
is obtained from the measured mass increase Δm
of the electrode and the transported charge Q =
(Δm/M)NA·e.
d) Determination of NA from X-Ray Diffraction
The most accurate method for the determination of NA
is based on X-ray diffraction or X-ray interferometry,
which are used to measure the distances between atoms
in a regular crystal [2.10]. This yields the total number
of atoms per volume if the crystal structure is known.
Let us consider a cubic crystal, where the atoms
sit at the corners of small cubes with sidelength a
(Fig. 2.9). When a plane wave with wavelength λ
is incident on the crystal under an angle ϑ against
a crystal plane (Fig. 2.10) the partial waves scattered
by the different atoms of adjacent planes with dis-
tance d interfere with each other. In the direction −ϑ,

Fig. 2.10. Bragg-reﬂection of X-rays by two crystal planes
which corresponds to the direction of specular reﬂec-
tion, their path difference is Δs = 2d · sin ϑ. If Δs
equals an integer m of the wavelength λ, the interfer-
ence is constructive and the amplitude of the different
partial waves add up. This is expressed by the Bragg
condition
2d · sin ϑ = m · λ .
(2.17)
At a given wavelength λ one obtains maxima of in-
tensity I(ϑ) of the scattered radiation only for those
inclination angles ϑ, for which (2.17) is fulﬁlled.
One sees from (2.17) that for m > 0 the wavelength
λ = 2d
m sin ϑ < 2d
has to be smaller than twice the distance d between ad-
jacent crystal planes. For visible light λ ≫d, but for
X-rays of sufﬁcient energy λ < 2d can be achieved (see
Sect. 7.6).
Note:
In (2.17) ϑ is the angle of the incident radiation against
the crystal planes not against the normal to the planes,
different from the conventional deﬁnition in optics.
The distances dk between neighboring parallel
planes depend on the orientation angle α of these
planes against the surface planes at the cube. For
a cubic crystal we conclude from Fig. 2.11:
dk = a · sin αk
for
αk ̸= 0

αk = 0 ,

where the lattice constant a gives the distance between

direction of the incident beam, one obtains for different
angles ϑm, maxima of the diffracted radiation, when
dk · sin ϑ = a · sin αk · sin ϑm = m · λ
for
m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
If the wavelength λ is known (see Sect. 7.6) the
distances dk between adjacent planes and therefore the
lattice constant a can be determined from the measured
angles ϑm.
A macroscopic crystal cube with sidelength D con-
tains N = (D/a)3 atoms if one atom sits at every
“lattice point”. The Avogadro number is then
NA = N · Mm

(2.19)
where Mc is the mass of the crystal, measured by
weighing, and Mm is its molar mass.
Note:
There are considerations to replace the reference for
a mass unit (until present it has been a 1 kg cylinder
of platinum-iridium in Paris) by a perfectly polished
and more readily measurable spherical crystal of sili-
con, which forms a cubic-face-centered crystal [2.11].
In such a crystal each elementary cubic cell with side-
length a contains 4 Si-atoms (One at a corner and three
at the centers of 3 side faces). A sphere with radius
Rs ≫a then contains
N = 4 · 4
3π Rs

(2.21)
from measurements of the lattice constant a (by X-ray
diffraction) and the density ϱ (or the mass M and ra-
dius Rs of the sphere), since the molar mass Mm is
known.
The experimental results for the distance a obtained
from such measurements range from 0.1–0.5 nm, de-
pending on the speciﬁc crystal. Since the diameters da
of the atoms cannot be larger than the lattice con-
stant a they have to be smaller than 0.1–0.5 nm (see
Sect. 2.4). This gives an upper limit for the size of the
atoms, forming the crystal.
The most accurate technique for measuring atom-
ic distances in crystals is X-ray interferometry which
combines X-ray diffraction with interferometric tech-
niques. Its basic principle is illustrated in Fig. 2.12. The
interferometer consists of three parallel slices Si, all
milled out of one large single crystal of Si. In the ﬁrst
slice S1 the incident X-ray beam is split into a trans-
mitted beam 1 and a diffracted beam 2. Diffraction at
the crystal planes parallel to the xy plane (in Fig. 2.12
schematically drawn as horizontal lines) occurs if the
Bragg condition (2.10) is fulﬁlled. Both beams again
suffer diffraction in the second parallel slice S2 where

(besides the transmitted beams, not shown in Fig. 2.12)
the diffracted beams 3 and 4 are generated, which
overlap in the third slice S3 where they can again be
transmitted or diffracted.
The transmitted part of beam 4 now interferes with
the diffracted part 5 of beam 3 and the detector D2
monitors the total intensity, which depends on the
phase difference between the partial waves 4 and 5.
Detector D1 measures the interference intensity of the
superimposed transmitted beam 3 and the diffracted
beam 6 of beam 4.
When the slice S3, which can be moved against the
others, is shifted into the z-direction by an amount Δz
the path difference Δs between the interfering beams
is changed by
δs = Δz
sin θ [1 −sin (90◦−2ϑ)] = 2Δz · sin ϑ .
(2.22)
The arrangement is similar to that of a Mach–Zehnder
interferometer in optics. However, since the wave-
length λ of X-rays is about 104 times smaller than that
of visible light, the accuracy of the device must be
correspondingly higher. If the slice S3 is shifted con-
tinuously, the detectors monitor maxima or minima of
the inferference intensity every time the path difference
δs becomes an integer multiple of λ.
The maxima are counted and its total number N at
a total shift Δz is
N = 2Δz · sin ϑ
λ
.
(2.23)
The total shift Δz is measured with a laser in-
terferometer to within an uncertainty of Δz/z =
10−6–10−7 [2.12, 13].
EXAMPLE
d = 0.2 nm, Δz = 1 mm, ϑ = 30◦→N = 5 × 106,
which allows an accuracy with a relative uncertainty
of 2 × 10−7.
Instead of X-rays also neutrons can be used [2.14].

2.2.4 The Importance of Kinetic Gas Theory
for the Concept of Atoms
The ﬁrst ideas of a possible relation between the in-
ternal energy U of a gas and the kinetic energies
of its molecules were put forward in 1821 by John
Herapath. Later in 1848 James Prescott Joule (1818–
1889) (Fig. 2.13) who had read the publication of
Herapath found by accurate measurements that me-
chanical energy could be converted into heat ener-
gy. Initiated by suggestions from August Karl Krönig
(1822–1879), Clausius and Maxwell put these ideas on
a more quantitative basis. They derived independent-
ly the general equation of gases pVm = RT from the
kinetic energies of the gas molecules. We will here
only give a simpliﬁed version of the gas kinetic mod-
el, which assumes that the gas inside a container with

2. The Concept of the Atom

cott Joule
volume V consists of atoms or molecules that can be
treated as small rigid balls with radius r0. They can
undergo elastic collisions with each other and with
the wall. For these collisions energy and momentum
are conserved. Collisions with the wall can only oc-
cur, if the balls approach the wall within a distance r0.
Collisions with each other can only happen when the
distance between the ball centers becomes d = 2r0. For
larger distances the interaction between the balls is ze-
ro. The interaction energy between two hard spheres is
therefore (Fig. 2.14):
Epot(r) = 0
for
r ≥2r0 ,
Epot(r) = ∞
for
r < 2r0 .
(2.24)
Fig. 2.14. Interaction potential between two hard spheres
with radius r0
If the density of such a model gas is sufﬁciently small
(r0 should be small compared to the mean distance ⟨d⟩
between the particles) it is called an ideal gas. For
an ideal gas the eigenvolume Ve = (4N/3)πr3
0 of the
N particles is small compared to the total volume V of
the gas. The particles can therefore be approximately
treated as point-like particles.
EXAMPLE
At a pressure of 1 bar and room temperature T =
300 K, 1 cm3 of a gas contains about 3 × 1019 atoms or
molecules. Their mean distance is ⟨d⟩= 3 nm. For he-
lium atoms r0 = 0.5 nm. This gives r0/ ⟨d⟩= 0.017 ≪
1 and Ve/V = 5 × 10−6. Helium under these condi-
tions can therefore be regarded as an ideal gas.
The gas exerts a pressure p onto the wall of the
container, which is caused by momentum transfer dur-
ing collisions of the gas molecules with the wall
(Fig. 2.15). Since the pressure is equal to the force per
surface A and the force equals the time derivative of
the momentum transfer, we obtain the relation for the
pressure p:
p = d
dt
momentum transfer to A
area A

.
(2.25)
If, for example, Nx atoms with velocity vx hit a wall
in the yz-plane per second, the momentum transfer per
second for completely elastic collisions is 2Nxmvx and
the pressure exerted onto the wall is
p = 2Nxmvx/A .
(2.26)
The number density n of N atoms in the volume V is
n = N/V . Let us ﬁrst only consider that fraction nx in
a cuboid with volume V that has velocities vx in the

Fig. 2.16. Illustration of (2.27)
x-direction (Fig. 2.16). Within the time interval t the
number of atoms Z hitting the area A of a wall in the
yz-plane is
Z = nxvx AΔt .
(2.27)
These are just the atoms inside the blue volume in
Fig. 2.16 with length vxΔt and cross section A.
Each atom transfers the momentum 2mvx. Therefore
the force acting on the surface element A is F =
2Zmvx/Δt = 2nxmv2
x A and the pressure p acting on
the wall is
p = 2mnxv2
x .
(2.28)
If an atom moves with the velocity v = {vx, vy, vz}
at an arbitrary angle against the wall, the momentum
transfer to the wall is only caused by its component vx,
because the tangential components parallel to the wall
do not transfer any momentum (Fig. 2.15).
There is another point we have to consider. Not all
atoms have the same velocity. At thermal equilibrium
the velocities of a resting gas are isotropic, i.e., each
direction is equally probable. Since the pressure of the
gas is isotropic the momentum transfer must be the
same in all directions. Therefore we obtain for the mean
square values

2.3 Can One See Atoms?
The spatial resolution of an optical microscope is limit-
ed by the wavelength λ of the light used to illuminate an
object. With some tricks one may achieve a resolution
of Δx ≥λ/2. Using the special technique of near-ﬁeld
microscopy, structures on surfaces can be resolved with
about 30 nm resolution. Since we have seen in the
preceding paragraph, that the size of atoms is around
0.2–0.5 nm, we cannot expect to see atoms directly
through a microscope with visible light (λ ≈500 nm).
However, several techniques have been developed
that allow an indirect observation of atoms and give
detailed information on atomic sizes, structure and
dynamics.
First of all, one can mark the location of atoms with
size d ≪λ through the light scattered by the atoms.
When an atom travels through an intense beam of vis-
ible laser light, it can absorb and reemit many photons
during its ﬂight time through the beam (Fig. 2.17).
One can then “see” the atom as a light spot, i.e., as
a structureless point and no information about its size
or structure can be obtained. One can only say: “It’s
there.”

There are several other methods that give similar
information. With computer graphics one can produce
nice pictures of such “atom images” on the screen,
which may be impressive because they appear to give
a magniﬁed picture of the microworld of atoms and
molecules. However, one should always keep in mind
that such pictures are produced due to the interaction
of light or particles with atoms. Only if this interaction
is fully understood can the interpretation of the images
give a true model of atoms or molecules. This will be
illustrated by the different techniques discussed in the
following sections.
2.3.1 Brownian Motion
The biologist and medical doctor Robert Brown
(1773–1858) discovered in 1827 that small particles
suspended in liquids performed small irregular move-
ments, which can be viewed under a microscope.
Although he ﬁrst thought that these movements were
caused by small living bacteria, he soon found out that
the movement could also be observed for inorganic
particles that are deﬁnitely not alive.
The observation can be explained if one assumes
that the particles are permanently hit by fast moving
atoms or molecules coming from statistically distribut-
ed directions (Fig. 2.18).
The visualization of Brownian motion is very im-
pressive. It is possible to demonstrate it to a large
auditorium when using cigarette smoke particles in

a microscope with a video camera.
Also here, the atoms are not directly seen but their
impact on the smoke particle can be measured and,
provided the mass of the smoke particle is known, the
atomic momentum transferred to the particle, can be
determined.
There is a nice demonstration that simulates
Brownian motion. A larger disk on an air table is hit
by many small discs, which simulate the air molecules.
If the large disc carries a small light bulb, its statistical
path over the course of time can be photographed and
the path lengths between two successive collisions (the
free path) can be measured (Fig. 2.19).
The basic theory of Brownian motion was devel-
oped independently in 1905 by Albert Einstein (1879–
1955) and Marian Smoluchowski (1872–1917). It is
closely related to diffusion [2.15]. We will only brieﬂy
outline the basic ideas here.
Assume particles in a gas show a small gradient
dn/dx of their number density n, described by the
linear relation (Fig. 2.20)
n(x) = n(0) −Gx .
(2.36)
Under the inﬂuence of mutual collisions the parti-
cles perform statistical movements with a probability
distribution f (ξ) where ξ is the length of such a dis-
placement in the x-direction between two collisions.
The number density of particles with movement ξ, is
then:
n(ξ) dξ = nf (ξ) dξ
with
n =

n(ξ) dξ ,

For a positive gradient G in (2.36) the number N+ of
particles moving through a unit area in the plane x = 0
into the +x-direction is larger than the corresponding

Eugen Kappler (1905–1977) demonstrated an ele-
gant experimental technique in 1939 [2.16]. A modern
version of it is shown in Fig. 2.22a. A small mir-
ror is suspended on a thin torsional wire. The air
molecules impinge on the mirror surface and cause, by
their momentum transfer, small statistical angular de-
viations Δϕ of the mirror from its equilibrium position
at ϕ = 0, which can be monitored by the reﬂection of
a laser beam, detected with a position-sensitive CCD
detector.
The system has only one degree of freedom; it
can only perform torsional vibrations around the axis
deﬁned by the torsional wire. With the deviation an-
gle ϕ from the equilibrium position ϕ = 0, the mean
potential and kinetic energies are:

2.3.2 Cloud Chamber
Charles T. Wilson (1869–1959) developed his cloud
chamber in 1911, which allowed him to view the spur
of single fast atoms, ions or electrons entering the
chamber. The basic principle is as follows: Incident
particles with sufﬁcient kinetic energy can ionize the
Fig. 2.23. Cloud chamber tracks of α particles (= He nu-
clei), which are emitted from a source below the lower edge
of the photograph. One α particle collides with a (not visi-
ble) nitrogen nucleus at the crossing point of the two arrows,
forming an 17
8 O nucleus and a proton. The O nucleus ﬂies
towards 11 o’clock, the proton towards 4 o’clock (from
W. Finkelnburg: Einführung in die Atomphysik, Springer,
Berlin Heidelberg New York, 1976)
atoms or molecules in the cloud chamber, which is
ﬁlled with supersaturated water vapor (nowadays alco-
hol vapor is generally used). The ions, formed along
the spur of the incident particle, attract the polar wa-
ter molecules and act as condensation nuclei for the
formation of small water droplets. When the cham-
ber is illuminated by visible light, the droplets cause
Mie-scattering which makes the particle track visible
as a thin bright spur of tiny water droplets (Fig. 2.23).
Although the observation of the different tracks in
the cloud chamber is impressive, it does not allow
a direct view of the incident particles themselves but
only locates their paths through the chamber. In former
times the cloud chamber was used for the observation
of nuclear reactions (see the example in Fig. 2.23).
Nowadays a new device, the bubble chamber, has re-
placed it and the cloud chamber is mainly used for
demonstration purposes.
2.3.3 Microscopes with Atomic Resolution
During the last four decades of the 20th century, new
devices have been developed that allow a spatial reso-
lution within the subnanometer range, and are therefore
capable of making single atoms “visible.” Since their
basic understanding demands the knowledge of atomic
physics and solid state physics, they can only be ex-
plained here in a more qualitative way while for their
quantitative description the reader is referred to the
literature [2.17, 18].
a) Field Emission Microscope
The oldest of these devices is the ﬁeld emission elec-
tron microscope (Fig. 2.24) developed by Ernst Müller
in 1937 [2.19]. A very sharp tip at the end of a thin
tungsten wire serves as a cathode in the middle of
an evacuated glass bulb. The anode has the form of
a sphere and is covered on the inside with a ﬂuores-
cent layer (like a television screen). When a voltage V
of several kilovolts is applied between cathode and an-
ode, the electric ﬁeld strength at the cathode surface is
E = V
r · ˆer ,
where r is the radius of the nearly spherical tip of
the tungsten wire (Fig. 2.24b). With special etching

on the tungsten tip
techniques it is possible to fabricate tips with r <
10 nm! This means that for a moderate voltage V =
1 kV the electric ﬁeld at the surface of the tungsten tip
is already E ≥1011 V/m. Such high electric ﬁelds ex-
ceed the internal atomic ﬁelds (see Sect. 3.5) and are
sufﬁciently large to release electrons from the metal
surface (ﬁeld emission, see Sect. 2.5.3). These elec-
trons are accelerated by the electric ﬁeld, follow the
electric ﬁeld lines, and impinge on the ﬂuorescent
screen at the anode where every electron causes a small
light ﬂash, similar to the situation at the screen of an
oscilloscope. Most of the electrons are emitted from
places at the cathode surface where the work func-
tion (i.e., the necessary energy to release an electron)
is minimum. These spots are imaged by the electrons
on the spherical anode (radius R) with a magniﬁca-
tion factor M = R/r. With R = 10 cm and r = 10 nm
a magniﬁcation of M = 107 is achieved (Fig. 2.24).
Even with this device, only the locations of elec-
tron emission are measured but no direct informa-
tion on the structure of atoms is obtained. If other
atoms with a small work functions are brought to the
cathode surface (for example by evaporating barium
atoms from an oven near the cathode) then the elec-
tron emission mainly comes from these atoms. One
can now see these atoms and their thermal motions
on the cathode surface with 107 fold magniﬁcation
(Fig. 2.24d).
b) Transmission Electron Microscope
The electron microscope, ﬁrst invented by Ernst Ruska
in 1932 has meanwhile been improved so much that it
reaches a spatial resolution of 0.1 nm [2.20–22]. The
electrons are emitted from a heated cathode wire with
a sharp kink (hair needle cathode) and are accelerat-
ed by a high voltage (up to 500 kV). With specially
formed electric or magnetic ﬁelds, serving as elec-
tron optics (see Sect. 2.6) the electrons are imaged
onto the sample, which is prepared as a thin foil
(Fig. 2.25). While transmitting through the sample, the
electrons are deﬂected by elastic collisions or loose
energy by inelastic collisions. The transmitted elec-
trons are imaged again onto a ﬂuorescent screen where
a magniﬁed image of the absorption or scattering cen-
ters in the sample is produced (Fig. 2.26), which can be
viewed either through an optical microscope or with
a CCD camera and an electronic image converting
system.
The spatial resolution of the electron microscope
increases with decreasing size of the electron source.
A nearly point-like source can be realized with ﬁeld
emission from a sharp edged tungsten tip (Fig. 2.27)
like that in the ﬁeld emission microscope. The emitted
electrons can than be imaged by the electron optics to
form a nearly parallel beam that traverses the sample.
Each point of the sample is then imaged with a large
magniﬁcation onto the screen.

The drawbacks of the transmission electron micro-
scope are the following:
•
Due to strong absorption of electrons by solid ma-
terials, the penetration depth is very small. One
therefore has to prepare the sample as a thin sheet.
•
The electron beam has to be intense in order to ob-
tain sufﬁcient image quality with a high contrast.
This means a larger current density j and total elec-
tron current I = Aj, where A is the illuminated
area.
•
The unavoidable absorption heats the sample up,
which may change its characteristics or may even
destroy parts of the sample. This is particularly
critical for biological samples.
Most of these drawbacks can be avoided with the
scanning electron microscope.
c) Scanning Electron Microscope
In the scanning electron microscope (Fig. 2.28) the
electron beam is focused onto the surface of the sam-
ple (which now is not necessarily a thin sheet), where
it produces light emission by excitation of the sample
molecules and secondary electrons by impact ioniza-
tion. The electron beam is scanned over the surface of

the sample by an appropriate deﬂection program for the
electron optics. This is quite similar to the situation in
a TV tube.
The ﬂuorescence light can be viewed through an
optical microscope or the secondary electrons, emit-
ted from the surface element dx dy of the sample, are
extracted by an electric extraction ﬁeld and imaged on-
to a detector where a signal S(x, y, t) is produced that
depends on the intensity of the secondary electrons
emitted from the small focal area dx dy around the
point (x, y), which in turn depends on the characteristic
properties of the sample at that location [2.23, 24].
d) Scanning Tunneling Microscope
The highest spatial resolution of structures on electri-
cal conducting solid surfaces has so far been achieved
with the scanning tunneling microscope, invented
at the research laboratories of IBM in Rüchlikon,
Switzerland [2.25, 26] in 1984 by Gerd Binning
(*1947) and Heinrich Rohrer (*1933), who were
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1986 for this invention.
Similar to the electron ﬁeld microscope a tungsten
needle with a very sharply etched tip is used, which is
however, not ﬁxed but is scanned in a controllable way
at a very small distance (a few tenths of a nanometer)
over the surface (Fig. 2.29).
If a small voltage of a few volts is applied be-
tween the tip (cathode) and the surface (anode) the
electrons can jump from the needle into the surface
by a process called tunneling (see Sect. 4.2.3). The
electric current depends exponentially on the distance
between tip and surface. When the tip is scanned over
the surface by piezo elements (these are ceramic cylin-
ders that change their length when an electric voltage
is applied to them), any deviation of the surface in the
z-direction from the exact xy-plane results in a change
of the tunnel current.
Generally the tunnel current is kept constant by
a controlled movement of the tip in vertical direction,
which always keeps it at the same distance Δz from
the real surface and therefore reﬂects the topography
z(x, y) of the surface. The control current of the piezo
element for the movement in z-direction is then tak-
en as the signal (Fig. 2.30), which is transferred to
a computer where a magniﬁed picture of the surface
can be seen (Fig. 2.31). If single atoms or molecules
are adsorbed at the surface, they can be viewed by
this technique, because the distance to the needle is
changed at the location of the atom.

R.G. Ulbricht, University of Göttingen)
An impressive demonstration of the capabilities of
the tunneling microscope was published by scientists
at the IBM research center in San Jose [2.29]. A clean
nickel surface at low temperatures was covered by
a few Xenon atoms. With the tunneling microscope
these atoms were picked up and transported to select-
ed places on the surface, where they were released
in such a way that the atoms formed the letters IBM
(Fig. 2.32). A similar experiment was performed by
Karl-Heinz Rieder and his group at the Free University

face with an atomic force microscope (with kind permission

surface to form the letters FU (with kind permission of Prof.
Rieder, FU Berlin)

surface using CO molecules (Fig. 2.33).
This is probably the most impressive way to
make single atoms “visible”, since here not on-
ly the location but also the size of the atoms or
molecules can be measured.

2.4. The Size of Atoms
29
e) Atomic Force Microscope
The tunneling microscope is restricted to the investiga-
tion of conductive surfaces because for nonconductive
surfaces the tunnel current would result in surface
charges that alter the potential and therefore the volt-
age between needle and surface. This limitation can be
overcome with the atomic force microscope, which us-
es a similar design as the tunneling microscope [2.31].
However, here it is not the tunnel current that is mea-
sured but the force between the atoms of the tip and
those at the surface. These very small forces are mea-
sured by monitoring, through the reﬂection of a laser
beam, the small upwards or downwards shift of the
carefully balanced lever carrying a small and sharp-
edged tip [2.33].
For a survey on these different modern techniques
the reader is referred to the literature [2.25–35].
2.4 The Size of Atoms
There are many experimental methods that allow the
estimation of atomic size. We will provide a brief
survey here.
In a liquid (for instance in liquid helium or argon)
the atoms can be assumed to be densely packed (other-
wise the liquid could be more readily compressed). If
one mole of a liquid with density ρl occupies the vol-
ume VM and has a mass MM the volume of a single
atom is
Va  VM/NA = MM/ (ρlNA) ,
(2.50a)
where NA is the Avogadro number. Assuming a spher-
ical size of the atom, its radius r0 is
r0 = (3Va/4π)1/3 .
(2.50b)
After discussing two further methods we will see in
Sect. 2.8 that atoms cannot be regarded as rigid balls
with a well-deﬁned radius. The electron cloud around
the atomic nucleus can be described by a charge distri-
bution that gradually decreases with increasing radius
and differs from the mass distribution within the atom.
The deﬁnition of atomic size and atomic radius is there-
fore dependent on the interaction between the atom and
the probe used to measure these quantities. Different
methods will therefore yield slightly different atomic
sizes.
2.4.1 The Size of Atoms
in the Van der Waals Equation
While an ideal gas (point-like particles without interac-
tions) obeys the general equation
pVM = RT
(2.51a)
between pressure p, mole volume VM and tempera-
ture T , a real gas with atoms of volume Va that interact
with each other, is described by the van der Waals
equation

p + a
V 2
M

(VM −b) = RT .
(2.51b)
The constant b = 4NAVa equals four times the “eigen-
volume” of all NA atoms in the mole volume VM (see
Problem 2.10), while a/V 2
M gives the “eigenpressure”
of the interacting atoms. The constant a depends on the
strength of the interaction between the atoms.
Measuring the relation between p and VM at differ-
ent temperatures T allows the separate determination
of the two constants a and b and therefore yields the
“covolume b” and the volume
Va =
b
4NA
(2.51c)
of a single atom.
2.4.2 Atomic Size Estimation
from Transport Coefcients
When the characteristic quantities of a gas such as
mass density, energy density or momentum are not
constant over the volume of the gas, the gradients of
these quantities cause transport phenomena that ﬁnally
lead to equilibrium at a homogeneous distribution if the
gradient is not maintained by external inﬂuences.
For density gradients, diffusion takes place where
mass is transported, for temperature gradients, heat
conduction occurs where energy is transported and for
velocity gradients, the momentum of the molecules is
transferred.
All these transport phenomena are realized on
a microscopic scale by collisions between atoms or
molecules and therefore the mean free path length 
(i.e., the mean distance an atom travels between two
collisions) plays an important role for the quantitative
description of all these phenomena.

30
2. The Concept of the Atom
In a gas at thermal equilibrium with atom number
density n the mean free path length is given by
Λ = (1/n · σ)

<v2> / <vr2>
(2.52a)
where <v2> is the mean square velocity of the gas
particles, <vr2> is the mean square relative velocity
and σ = (r1 + r2)2 is the collision cross section. The
cross section σ = π(rA + rB)2 for collisions between
atoms A and B is deﬁned as the circular disc with ra-
dius (rA + rB) around the center of atom A with radius
rA through which atom B with radius rB has to pass in
order to touch atom A and suffer a collision (Fig. 2.34).
The relative velocity of two particles with veloc-
ities vi and vk is vr = vi −vk. Therefore <vr2>=
<(vi −vk)2>=<vi2> + <vk2> −2 <vi · vk>.
Since the directions of the velocities vi and vk are
randomly orientated, the mean scalar product is
zero. If all particles of the gas have the same mass,
vi2 = vk2 = v2. Therefore <vr2>= 2 <v2>. This
means the the mean square relative velocity of a
gas of equal atoms is twice the mean square of the
absolute velocity. The free mean pathlength  then
becomes

Measuring the mean free pathlength Λ gives
information on the collision cross section and
therefore on the size of the colliding atoms.
The above mentioned transport phenomena are di-
rectly related to . They can therefore be used to
measure the size of atoms or molecules.
•
Diffusion:
If a density gradient dn/dz exists in a gas, there will
be a net mass transport dM/dt per second through
the area A perpendicular to the z-direction. The
mass ﬂux density is then
jZM = 1
A
dM
dt = −Dm dn
dz .
(2.53)
The diffusion coefﬁcient D for atoms with mass m
and number density n can be calculated as
D = 1
3vΛ =

3pσ
(kT)3/2
(πm)1/2
(2.54)
because the mean velocity of the atoms is ¯v =
(8kT/πm)1/2.
•
Heat conduction
In a gas with a temperature gradient dT/dz the heat
energy transported per second through the area A is
given by
dQ
dt = −λAdT
dz ,
(2.55)
where λ is the coefﬁcient of heat conduction. It is
related to the speciﬁc heat cv of the gas at constant
volume by
λ = 1

Measuring the coefﬁcient λ therefore yields the col-

Viscosity of a Gas
If a velocity gradient dvy/dx exists in a gas ﬂowing
in the y-direction with the velocity vy, part of their
momentum per unit volume
p = n · m· <vy>
is transferred between adjacent layers x = a and
x = a + dx (Fig. 2.35). This momentum transfer

depends on the velocity difference between ad-
jacent layers x = a and x = a + Δx and on the
frictional force between the molecules and there-
fore on the viscosity η. The frictional force exerted
per area A in the plane x = const. can be written as
Fr = η · A · dvy/dx
(2.57a)
This force is due to collisions between the atoms.
The momentum transferred per sec through the area
A between adjacent layers x = a and x = a+Δx of
the gas is:
dp/dt = n·m· A·<vy >(dvy/dx) ·Δx with Δx=Λ
(2.57b)
because the mean distance the atoms travel between
two collisions equals the mean free path Λ. The
mean thickness Δx of a layer therefore has to be
equal to the mean free path Λ. Since the force
Fr equals the time derivative dp/dt of the trans-
ferred momentum, we obtain from the comparison
of (2.57a and b) for the viscosity η the relation
η = n · m· <vy> ·.
(2.58a)
where <vy> is the thermal average about the ve-
locity of the ﬂowing gas. Since there is a gradient
of vy we have to take the average over the different
velocities in the area y = const, through which the
gas ﬂows. This gives a factor 1/2 and we obtain for
the viscosity
η = 1/2n · m· <v> ·Λ = m <v> /(2σ√2)
(2.58b)
The viscosity η can be measured with different arrange-
ments. One possible example is the measurement of the
force which is necessary to maintain a constant mass
ﬂux dM/dt of a gas with density ρ through a circular
pipe with radius r and length L. This force is πr2 · p,
where p is the pressure difference between the two
ends of the pipe. The mass ﬂux dM/dt = ρ·dV/dt is
related to the viscosity by
ρ · dV/dt) = πr4Δp/(8ηL)
(2.59)
In summary:
Measurements of diffusion coefﬁcient D or heat
conduction coefﬁcient λ or viscosity η yield the
corresponding collision cross sections and there-
fore the size of atoms. Since atoms are not really
hard spheres their mutual interactions do not
abruptly drop at distances r1 + r2 but fall off only
gradually. Therefore, the different methods give
slightly different values of the atomic size.
2.4.3 Atomic Volumes from X-Ray Diffraction
In Sect. 2.2.3 we have seen that the diffraction of
X-rays by periodic crystals is one of the most accu-
rate methods for the determination of the distances
between adjacent lattice planes. From such distances
the volume VE of the elementary lattice cell (often
called a primitive cell) (Fig. 2.36) can be obtained.
In order to derive the volume Va of the atoms of the
crystal, one has to know which fraction f of the ele-
mentary cell volume is actually ﬁlled by atoms. If there

volume
Va = f VE/NE .
(2.60)
The following three examples illustrate different values
of f for some simple lattice structures, assuming the
atoms to be described by hard spheres with radius r0.
EXAMPLES
1. Primitive cubic crystal
It consists of atoms placed at the eight corners of
the cubic elementary cell, which touch each oth-
er (Fig. 2.37a). The ﬁgure shows that only 1/8 of
the volume of each atom is inside the elementary
cell. This means that NE = 8 × 1/8 = 1. The side
length of the cubic primitive cell is a = 2r0, and the
ﬁlling factor is

agonal, so that 4r0 = a

elementary cell one atom sits at the center of each
of the six faces (Fig. 2.37b).
These atoms touch each other along the side face
diagonal, which has the length a
√
2 = 4r0. From
the ﬁgure it is clear, that only one half of each atom
at the side faces belongs to the elementary cell. The
number of atoms per elementary cell is then: NE =

The atomic volume Va can now be obtained
from (2.61), where VE is determined by X-ray diffrac-
tion and NE from the crystal structure.
2.4.4 Comparison of the Different Methods
The different methods all give the same order of mag-
nitude for the atomic size although their values for
the atomic radii differ slightly, as can be seen from
Table 2.2. These differences have to do with the above-
mentioned difﬁculty in deﬁning an exact atomic radius
as can be done for a rigid sphere. The real atoms ex-
perience long-range attractive forces and short-range
repulsive forces when interacting with other atoms
or molecules. The interaction potential between two

The atomic radii all lie within the range of
(0.5–5) × 10−10 m = 0.5–5 Å. Their exact val-
ues depend on the atomic model. Different meth-
ods for their measurement give slightly different
values because they probe different parts of the
interaction potential.
2.5 The Electric Structure of Atoms
Various experimental investigations had already shown
at the end of the 19th century that matter consists of
electrically charged particles. The essential evidence
came from:
•
Investigations of electrolytic conductivity in polar
liquids, which proved that molecules could disso-
ciate into positively and negatively charged con-
stituents that drift in opposite directions when in
an external electric ﬁeld. They were called “ions”
(from the Greek word “ιoν” for “the moving”).
Michael Faraday found that the charge transport-
ed to the electrodes was proportional to the mass
transport (see Sect. 2.2.3.e).
•
Experiments on gas discharges, where the observed
light emission could be drastically inﬂuenced by
electric or magnetic ﬁelds. This proves that elec-
trically charged particles are moving within the
discharge region.
•
Observations of the inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on
the electric current in metals and semiconductors
(Hall effect, Barlow’s wheel).
•
The discovery that particles emitted from ra-
dioactive substances show different deﬂections in
magnetic ﬁelds. They should therefore consist of
positively charged heavy particles (called α parti-
cles) and negatively charged light particles (called
β-particles, which are identical with electrons)
(Fig. 2.39).

2. The Concept of the Atom
These experimental ﬁndings together with the assump-
tion that matter is composed of atoms led to the
following hypothesis:
Atoms are built up of charged particles. They can
therefore not be “indivisible,” but have a sub-
structure, which, however, was unknown at this
time. The electrically charged positive and nega-
tive constituents have different masses.
This raises the questions:
•
What properties do these constituents have?
•
What force keeps them together to form stable
atoms?
•
What is the charge distribution inside the atom?
•
How can the microscopic properties of matter be
explained by this model?
We can answer some of these questions immediately;
the others are discussed at the end of this chapter.
Since atoms are neutral, the amount of positive and
negative charge in an atom must be equal in order
to compensate each other. Many classical experiments
have shown that the electric Coulomb force is larger
than the gravitational force by about 20 orders of mag-
nitude. The latter is therefore completely negligible for
the stability of atoms. Electric forces are responsible
for the interaction between the constituents of an atom.
Why the attractive Coulomb force between the posi-
tive and negative atomic constituents does not lead to
the collapse of atoms has only been later answered by
quantum mechanics (see Sect. 3.4.3).
2.5.1 Cathode Rays and Kanalstrahlen
Investigations of gas discharges by J. Plucker (1801–
1868), Johann Wilhelm Hittorf (1824–1914), Joseph
John Thomson (1856–1940), Phillip Lenard (1862–
1947) (Nobel Prize 1905), and many others have all
contributed much to our understanding of the electric
structure of atoms. It is worthwhile to note that the es-
sential experimental progress was only possible after
the improvement of vacuum technology (the invention
of the mercury diffusion pump, for example, allowed
one to generate vacua down to 10−6 hPa).
In a gas discharge tube at low pressures, Hittorf
observed particle rays emitted from the cathode that
followed (without external ﬁelds) straight lines, which
he could prove by the shadow that was produced on
a ﬂuorescent screen when obstacles were put in the
path of the cathode rays. From the fact that these par-
ticle rays could be deﬂected by magnetic ﬁelds, Hittorf
correctly concluded that they must be charged parti-
cles and from the direction of the deﬂection it became
clear that they were negatively charged (Fig. 2.40). The
ﬁrst quantitative, although not very accurate, determi-
nation of the magnitude of their charge was obtained
in 1895 by J.B. Perrin (and with an improved appara-
tus in 1897 by Thomson, who collimated the particles
through a slit in the anode, deﬂected them after the an-
ode by 90◦through a magnetic ﬁeld and detected them
by an electrometer (Fig. 2.41a)).
With the design of Fig. 2.41b, where the cathode
rays are better collimated by two slits B1 and B2,
thus producing a small spot on the ﬂuorescent screen,
Thomson could measure the ratio e/m of charge e
to mass m of the particles by applying electric and
magnetic ﬁelds for beam deﬂection (see Sect. 2.6).
This was the ﬁrst example of a cathode ray oscillo-
scope. Thomson could also show that the ratio e/m
was independent of the cathode material, but was about
104 times larger than that for the “Kanalstrahlen”
discovered in 1886 by Eugen Goldstein (1850–1930)
in a discharge tube, which ﬂy through a hole in
the cathode in the opposite direction of the cathode
rays (Fig. 2.42). Wilhelm Wien (1864–1928) mea-
sured in 1897 the value of e/m for the particles in
the Kanalstrahlen and he proved that they are posi-
tively charged atoms of the gas inside the discharge
tube [2.36].

The negative light particles of the cathode rays
were named electrons after a proposal by J. Stoney
and G. Fitzgerald in 1897. The positively charged
heavy particles were named ions according to the ex-
isting name for charged atoms or molecules in the
electrolysis.
This short survey on the history of gas discharges
shows that all of these discoveries were made with-
in the short time span of a few years. They gave the

Atoms consist of negatively charged electrons
and positively charged particles that just compen-
sate the negative charge to make the whole atom
neutral.
Still nothing was known about the spatial distribu-
tion of negative and positive charges within the atom
and about the sizes of the charged particles.
2.5.2 Measurement of the Elementary Charge e
The ﬁrst measurement of the absolute value of the
charge of a positive ion was made in 1899 by Thomson
and his student Charles Wilson, who had developed
his cloud chamber (see Sect. 2.3). The ions generat-
ed in the cloud chamber by external radiation act as
nucleation centers for water droplets by attraction of
water molecules in supersaturated water vapor. These
small droplets, which are made visible by illumination,
sink slowly due to gravity. They reach a constant ter-
minal sink velocity in air with viscosity η when the
gravitational force Fg = m∗g (m∗= m −ρairV is the
apparent mass, taking into account the buoyancy) just
equals the opposite frictional force Ff = −6πηrv for
spherical particles. This gives for the apparent mass m∗
the equation
gm∗= g (ρwater −ρair) 4
3πr3 = 6πηrv .
(2.64)
From the measured values of the sink velocity
v = m∗g
6πηr ,
(2.64a)
which depends on the viscosity η of the gas, the ra-
dius r of the droplets can be determined and from the
total mass, condensed at the lower plate of the cloud
chamber per unit time and the transported charge Q, the
number of particles N can be obtained. This gives the
average charge q = Q/N of each particle. Assuming
that each particle carries only one elementary charge,
Thomson estimated this charge to be around 10−19 C,
close to the correct value of 1.6 × 10−19 C.
A much more accurate value was obtained 1910 by
Robert Andrew Millikan (1868–1953) in his famous oil
droplet experiment [2.37]. With an atomizer, he blew
a ﬁne spray of minute oil droplets into the air between
the two horizontal plates of a condenser (Fig. 2.43).

These droplets could be viewed through a microscope
by illuminating them with an arc lamp. They were
charged by irradiation with X-rays, which strip off
a small number n of electrons (n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .) from
the droplets, leaving them positively charged. Without
an electric ﬁeld, the droplets sink down with con-
stant terminal velocity v0, if the gravitational force
m∗g is just compensated for by the frictional force.
From (2.64) we then obtain
v0 = g (ρoil −ρair) 4

⇒r =

(2.65a)
From the measured sink velocity v0, therefore, the ra-
dius r of the droplets is obtained if the viscosity η of
air is known.
If an electric ﬁeld E0 is now applied, an additional
force Fa = q E0 acts on the droplet, where q = −ne
and −e is the charge of one electron. With the right
ﬁeld polarity the droplet can be kept at a constant height
if the electric force just compensates for the gravitation:
n · eE0 = −g (ρoil −ρair) 4
3πr3 .
(2.65b)
This gives the charge of the droplet
−q = ne = −g

3πr3 (ρoil −ρair) ,
(2.65c)
where r is taken from (2.65a).
In a variation of the experiment a larger electric
ﬁeld E1 is applied, which moves the droplets upwards.
One droplet now experiences the total force
F = q E1 −g 4
3πr3 (ρoil −ρair) −6πηrv ,
(2.65d)
which becomes zero for the terminal velocity
v1 = qE1 −g 4

.
(2.65e)
Subtracting (2.65a) from (2.65e) gives
v1 −v0 = qE1

(2.65f)
can be obtained. When the droplet changes its charge,
its terminal velocity v1 will change. The smallest
change is observed for Δn = 1. This gives the elemen-
tary charge e.
Millikan had already noted that the results he ob-
tained scattered for droplets with different radii. The
reason for this is that Stokes’ law for the viscosity force
on moving spheres is only valid if the radius r of the
droplet is large compared with the mean free path  of
the air molecules. This was not strictly true for the oil
droplets, and particularly not for the smaller ones.
EXAMPLE
At a pressure of 1 bar the mean free path length
is Λ ≈5 × 10−6 m = 5 μm. For droplets with r <
10 μm a correction to (2.65a) has to be made.
The presently accepted value for e is e =
1.602176487(40) × 10−19 C, where the number
in parentheses gives the uncertainty of the two
last digits.

2.5.3 How to Produce Free Electrons
Free electrons can be produced in many different ways.
We will discuss the most important methods.
a) Thermal Emission from Solid Surfaces
When a metal is heated to a high temperature T
a fraction of the free conduction electrons can get a suf-
ﬁciently large kinetic energy to overcome the attraction
by the solid and can leave the metal (thermal emission)
(Fig. 2.44a). If these electrons are collected onto an an-
ode by an accelerating electric ﬁeld one observes an
electric current I with a current density js [A/m2] per
unit area of the emitting surfaces, which follows the
Richardson equation
js = AT 2e−Wa/kT ,
(2.66)
where Wa is the work function of the metal, i.e., the
necessary minimum energy of the electrons to leave
the metal. The constant A depends on the material and
the condition of the surface (Table 2.3). For a regular
crystal, A also depends on the direction of the surface
normal against the crystal axes. In order to achieve high
current ﬂuxes, materials with low values of Wa and

high melting temperatures are needed. A commonly
used composite material is tungsten doped with bar-
ium or cesium. At high temperatures the barium or
cesium atoms diffuse to the surface where they con-
tribute to a low work function Wa. The measured anode
current increases with the applied voltage until it reach-
es a saturation value, where all electrons, emitted from
the cathode, are collected by the anode (Fig. 2.44a).
Thermal emission represents the most important
technique for the production of free electrons in oscil-
loscope tubes, TV tubes, broadcasting electron valves,
and for all instruments where high current densities
are required, such as electron beam welding or ion
sources for accelerators. In Fig. 2.44b different types
of cathodes are shown.
b) Field Emission
When a voltage U is applied between an anode and
a cathode formed as a sharp tip with radius r on a tung-
sten wire, the electric ﬁeld (E) = U/r may become
as large as 1011 V/m (see Sect. 2.3). Such high ﬁelds
change the potential at the surface of the tip and can
extract electrons. Field emission is technically used
in cases where a nearly point-like electron source is
required, such as in the ﬁeld emission electron micro-
scope (Sect. 2.2.3) and in some types of high resolution
electron microscopes (Fig. 2.27).
c) Photoeffect at Metal Surfaces
When the surface of a metal is illuminated by UV light,
electrons with kinetic energy
Ekin = hν −Wa
(2.67)

38
2. The Concept of the Atom
are emitted from the surface where ν is the optical fre-
quency of the illuminating light and h is a constant
(Planck’s constant, see Sect. 3.2), Wa is the work func-
tion of the metal (i.e., the minimum energy required to
release an electron (see Table 2.3)).
d) Secondary Electron Emission
When the surface of a metal is irradiated with fast elec-
trons or ions instead of photons, so-called “secondary”
electrons are emitted (Fig. 2.45). The average number
of emitted electrons per single incident particle is called
the coefﬁcient of secondary emission. It depends on the
material, the angle α of incidence and on the kind of in-
cident particles and their energy. Some values for η are
given in Table 2.4.
Secondary emission plays an important role in
many optical and spectroscopic devices. One example

is the photomultiplier (Fig. 2.46), where the incident
light releases electrons from the cathode (photoeffect),
which are then accelerated by an electric ﬁeld and
impinge on a specially formed electrode. There they
release secondary electrons, which are again acceler-
ated onto a second electrode, and so on. Finally an
electron avalanche arrives at the anode with a charge
q = Me, where the magniﬁcation factor M = ηm de-
pends on the secondary emission coefﬁcient and on
the number m of electrodes. Typical values of M are:
M = 105–107. The electric charge pulse q(t) produces
a voltage Va(t) = q(t)/Ca at the exit capacitance Ca,
which is discharged through a resistor R between anode
and ground potential.

If the photocathode is replaced by a metal electrode
with a high secondary emission coefﬁcient η, single
particles (electrons or ions) that are impinging on the
cathode can be detected (electron- or ion-multiplier).
Other examples of secondary electron emission ap-
plications are image intensiﬁer or scanning surface
electron microscopes (Sect. 2.3.3).
2.5.4 Generation of Free Ions
While the techniques described above produced free
electrons emitted from solid surfaces, in the following
processes pairs of ions and electrons, generally in the
gas phase, are being formed.
a) Electron Impact Ionization
The most important mechanism for the production of
free ion-electron pairs is the electron impact ionization,
where an electron with sufﬁcient kinetic energy Ekin
hits an atom A and releases another electron
e−(Ekin) + A →A+ + e−(E1) + e−(E2) .
(2.68a)
The ﬁnal energies E1, E2 of the electrons after the
reaction have to obey energy conservation
E1 + E2 = Ekin −Eion .
(2.68b)
Here a neutral atom looses one electron, which had
a binding energy Eion (also called the “ionization en-
ergy”) and is split into a positively charged ion A+
and an electron e−(Fig. 2.47). The probability of this
process depends on the kinetic energy Ekin of the inci-
dent electron, the atomic particle A and the ionization
energy Eion of the released electron. It is generally
described by the ionization cross section σion(Ekin),
which gives the circular area around atom A through
which the primary electron has to pass in order to
ionize A. Figure 2.48 shows ionization cross sections
σion(Ekin) for some atoms A as a function of the
electron impact energy Ekin.

Electron impact ionization in gas discharges rep-
resents the major contribution to the generation
of charge carriers.
When ions B+ instead of electrons collide with
atoms A to produce ionization
B+(Ekin) + A →A+ + B+ + e−
(2.68c)
the relative kinetic energy Ekin of the collision partners
must be much higher than the ionization energy Eion of
the electron, because only a small fraction (≈me/mB)
of the kinetic energy of the heavy particle B can
be transferred during the collision to the electron of
atom A which has to be removed from the atom.

40
2. The Concept of the Atom
b) Photoionization of Atoms
When atoms are irradiated with light of sufﬁcient-
ly short wavelengths (generally ultraviolet light), the
absorbed light can excite an atomic electron to an en-
ergy above the ionization limit (photoionization, see
Sect. 7.6.1). This process represents the leading mecha-
nism for the production of ions in the upper atmosphere
(ionosphere). Here the UV light of the sun can ionize
nearly all atoms and molecules in this region. Since
the photoionization cross section is generally small,
efﬁcient photoionization of atoms demands high light
intensities in the UV. This process therefore gained
increasing importance after the introduction of lasers,
which can deliver intensities many orders of magnitude
larger than conventional light sources (see Chap. 8).
c) Charge Exchange Collisions
When ions A+ pass through a gas or metal vapor of
neutral atoms B, an electron can be transferred from
the atom B to the ion A+ during the close passage of
A+ with B
A+ + B →A + B+
(2.68d)
if the ionization energy of B is smaller than that of A.
When slow electrons pass through a gas of neutral
atoms A, they may be captured by the atoms to form
negative ions
e−+ A →A−
(2.68e)
if the relative kinetic energy Ekin can be transferred
to a third partner. This process plays an important
role in the earth’s atmosphere and also in the sun’s
photosphere where the process
H + e−→H−+ hν
(2.68f)
is mainly responsible for the emission of the sun’s
continuous visible radiation. The inverse process
H−+ H + Ekin(H−, H) →H + H + e−
(2.68g)
resupplies the neutral H atoms lost by the pro-
cess (2.68f).
d) Thermal Ionization
At very high temperatures the kinetic energy of atoms
may become sufﬁciently large to allow ionizing atomic
collisions.
A + B →A + B+ + e−
→A+ + B + e−
→A+ + B+ + 2e−
(2.69)
depending on the kinetic energy of the relative motion
of A and B. Such processes occur, for instance, in the
hot atmospheres of stars. The state of matter at these
high temperatures consisting of a mixture of neutral
atoms, ions and electrons, is called a plasma.
The different mechanisms for the production of ions
are summarized in Fig. 2.49.

duction of ions. (a) Electron impact ionization. (b) Ion
impact ionization. (c) Charge exchange for grazing collisions.

e) Technical Ion Sources
For the practical realization of atomic or molecular
ionization, special devices for the ion production have
been developed which are called ion sources.
The most widely spread source is the electron im-
pact ion source (Fig. 2.50). Electrons are emitted by
a hot cathode and are accelerated by a cylindrical an-
ode in the form of a grid around the cathode. They pass

are inserted. The electrons can be reﬂected by the elec-
trode GE allowing them to pass through the ionization
volume a second time.
The ions formed by this electron impact are ex-
tracted by properly designed electrodes at a negative
potential. They are imaged by special ion optics (see
Sect. 2.6) and form a nearly parallel beam of ions,
which can then be mass selected by electric or magnetic
ﬁelds (see Sect. 2.7).
The electron impact ion sources are operated at
low pressures (10−3–10−5 mbar). This implies that the
achievable ion currents are relatively small. Higher ion
currents can be realized with plasma ion sources, where
a gas discharge at high pressures is maintained. One ex-
ample is the duo-plasmatron source (Fig. 2.51) where
a low voltage gas discharge is initiated between the
heated cathode and the anode. The ions are extracted
by a high voltage (several kV) through the small hole
in an auxiliary electrode that compresses the plasma
and therefore increases its spatial density. A magnetic
ﬁeld keeps the plasma away from the walls and fur-
ther increases the ion density. Even substances with
low vapor pressure can be vaporized (for example by
electron- or ion impact) and can then be ionized inside
the discharge.
A more detailed discussion of different techniques
for the production of ions can be found in [2.38–40].
2.5.5 The Mass of the Electron
All methods for the determination of the electron mass
use the deﬂection of electrons in electric or magnetic
ﬁelds, where the Lorentz force
F = q(E + v × B)
(2.70a)
acts on a particle with charge q, which moves with
a velocity v across the ﬁelds (Fig. 2.52). Inserting
Newton’s equation F = m¨r into (2.70a) we obtain the
three coupled differential equations

2. The Concept of the Atom
These equations show that it is not the mass m direct-
ly, but only the ratio q/m that can be obtained from
measuring the path of a charged particle in these ﬁelds.
One therefore needs an additional measurement (for in-
stance the Millikan experiment) in order to determine
the charge q seperately. The mass m can then be ob-
tained from one of the following experiments, which
illustrate (2.70) by several examples.
a) Fadenstrahlrohr
Electrons emitted from a hot cathode in a glass bulb
are accelerated in the y-direction and enter a magnetic
ﬁeld that points into the z-direction (Fig. 2.53). Since
here v = {0, vy, 0} and B = {0, 0, Bz}, (2.70b) reduces
with q = −e to
¨x = −e
m vy Bz .
(2.70c)
This shows that the electrons are bent into the x-
direction and acquire a velocity component vx but
remain within the plane z = const. The Lorentz force is
always perpendicular to their velocity v = {vx, vy} and
therefore does not change the magnitude of the veloc-
ity. The path of the electrons is therefore a circle with
a radius R (Fig. 2.54) deﬁned by the compensation of
centrifugal and Lorentz force

(2.71b)
because the velocity v of the electrons is determined by
the acceleration voltage V according to (m/2)v2 = eV .
The path of the electrons can be made visible, if
the glass bulb is ﬁlled with a gas at low pressure so
that the mean free path of the electrons is comparable
to the circumference of the circle. Through collisions
with the electrons, the atoms are excited and emit light
(see Sect. 3.4). This visible circular path of the elec-
trons allows the measurement of its radius R and of the
ratio
e
m =
2V
R2B2 .
(2.72)
If the electrons enter the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld
under the angle α against the ﬁeld direction, the elec-
tron velocity v = {vx, 0, vz} can be composed of the
two components vx and vz (Fig. 2.55). The vx compo-
nent is perpendicular to the ﬁeld and leads to a circular
motion with radius R = mvx/(eB) and a circulation
time T = 2π R/vx = 2πm/(eB) independent of the
velocity component vx! The vz component is paral-
lel to the ﬁeld lines and therefore the Lorentz force is
zero. This component leads to a straight line. The su-
perposition of the two movements results in a helical
path around the ﬁeld lines with a pitch Δz = T vz =
2π Rvz/vx = 2π R/ tan α. For α = 90◦the electron
path lies in the x-y plane and becomes a circle.

2.5. The Electric Structure of Atoms
43

magnetic ﬁeld under an angle α ̸= 90◦against the ﬁeld lines
A more accurate measurement of e/m is possible
with the Wien ﬁlter of Fig. 2.56, where an electron
beam is accelerated through a voltage V and enters
with the velocity v a region where a homogeneous
electric ﬁeld E = {−Ex, 0, 0} and a magnetic ﬁeld
B = {0, −By, 0} are superimposed in such a way that
the two forces are antiparallel. The electron beam is
collimated by the aperture S1 to assure that the veloc-
ity components vx, vy become negligibly small. With
the proper selection of ﬁeld strengths one can achieve
that the total force F = −e(v × B) −eE acting on the
electrons becomes zero. This gives
vz ≈v =

Only electrons with a velocity v that give the exact
compensation of the electric and magnetic forces can
pass through the second aperture S2 and reach the
detector.

with two radio frequency deﬂection plates separated by the

Besides its application to the determination of the
ratio e/m, the Wien ﬁlter can be used as a narrow
velocity ﬁlter for electron or ion beams.
Instead of the Wien ﬁlter two condensers C1 and C2
can be used (Fig. 2.57). When an AC voltage with fre-
quency f is applied to the condensors the electric ﬁeld
is time dependent. Electrons can only pass through the
aperture S2, if they transverse the ﬁrst condenser C1 at
a time where the voltage is zero and they pass through
the next aperture S3 if they also traverse the second
condenser at zero voltage. With the separation L be-
tween the two condensers their ﬂight time T = L/v =
n/2 f must be an integer multiple n of the half peri-
od ΔT/2 = 1/2 f of the AC voltage. This imposes the
condition
vz =

2V e
m
= 2L f/n .
(2.74)
Varying the frequency f or the acceleration voltage V
yields maxima of the signal for the different values of
the integers n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. This allows the determina-
tion of n and thus of e/m.
The accuracy of e/m measurements has steadily
increased over the course of time. However, system-
atic errors have often mislead experimenters and the
results of different laboratories often differed by more
than the error limits stated by the different scientists
(Fig. 2.58). The main uncertainty for the determi-
nation of the electron mass m from the measured
ratio e/m stems from the error limits in the mea-
surement of the charge e. The best value accepted
today is
me = (9.10938215 ± 0.0000005) × 10−31 kg .

2.5.6 How Neutral is the Atom?
The experiments discussed so far have shown that
atoms can be split into negatively charged electrons
and positive ions. Millikan had measured the charge of
positive ions that missed one or several electrons.
The question now is how exactly the negative
charge of the atomic electrons is compensated by the
positive charge in a neutral atom. We will see later
that this positive charge is provided by the protons in
the atomic nucleus. Our question can therefore also be
stated as:
Is there any difference in the absolute values of
electron and proton charges?
This question is of fundamental importance, be-
cause a tiny difference would cause huge macroscopic
effects. For example, if there was a difference
Δq = |e+| −|e−| ≥2 × 10−18 e
the expansion of the universe could be explained by
electrostatic repulsion forces [2.41].
In order to give upper limits for such a possible dif-
ference Δq, precision experiments have been designed.
We will only discuss a few of them.
a) Gas Effusion
Through the oriﬁce of a large, electrically isolat-
ed metal container containing N atoms or molecules
(dN/dt)Δt atoms effuse during the time interval Δt
into vacuum and are condensed at a cold wall

Fig. 2.59. Experimental arrangement for obtaining an upper
limit for a possible difference Δq = |e+| −|e−|
(Fig. 2.59). If there was a net charge Δq per atom,
the isolated container would loose the charge ΔQ =
Δq(dN/dt)Δt. With a capacitance of the container C,
this would lead to a voltage V = ΔQ/C of the con-
tainer against the ground, which could be measured
with an electrometer. The experiment showed that no
measurable voltage appeared.
EXAMPLE
dN/dt = 1020 s−1, Δt = 100 s, C = 10−9F ⇒V =
1022(Δq/C) Volt ⇒Δq = 10−22 · 10−9 As. Since the
voltage can be measured with an uncertainty of 10−9 V,
the upper limit of a possible charge Δq per atom must
be Δq ≤10−40 As ≈10−21 e.
b) Deﬂection of an Atomic Beam
Out of a cold reservoir, atoms effuse and are collimat-
ed by two slits S1 and S2 to form a well collimated

2.6. Electron and Ion Optics
45
Fig. 2.60. Measuring the neutrality of atoms in an atomic
beam experiment
horizontal beam, which is slightly bent due to gravita-
tion. Between the two apertures, a condenser is placed
where a positive or negative voltage is alternatively ap-
plied (Fig. 2.60). If there was any charge Δq, the beam
would be deﬂected and the signal monitored by the de-
tector behind A2 would change. No such change was
observed.
EXAMPLE
The oriﬁce of the reservoir had a diameter of 0.04 mm
and the width of the two slits is also 0.04 mm, the
distance between oriﬁce and slit S1 was 400 cm, the
length of the condenser 200 cm. With a voltage of
10 kV and a plate separation of 2 mm the electric ﬁeld is
E = 5 × 106 V/m and the force acting on charged par-
ticles is F = Δq E. For Cs atoms this experiment gave
with a mean velocity of v = 300 m/s an upper limit of
Δq ≤10−32 As ≈10−13 · e (see Problem 2.12).
c) Floating Ball
This experiment has similarities with Millikan’s oil
droplet experiment. Here a small ferromagnetic ball
with diameter 0.1 mm is kept ﬂoating in a vacuum by an
electromagnet, where the magnetic force just cancels
the gravity force. The ball position can be monitored by
a laser beam reﬂected at grazing incidence by the ball
(Fig. 2.61). The surfaces of the two magnetic poles car-
ry the plates of a condenser, which produces an electric
ﬁeld E. If the ball with N atoms each with Z electrons
carried a net charge
ΔQ = Q+ −Q−= N Z
"
|e+| −|e−|
#
(2.75)
the ball would experience a force F = ΔQ E that
would shift the ball out of its equilibrium position. This
could be measured sensitively through the correspond-
ing deviation of the reﬂected laser beam [2.42].

In summary, all of these experiments showed
that a possible difference Δq = (e+) −(e−) bet-
ween the amounts of the charges of proton and
electron has to be smaller than Δq < 10−21 e ≈
1.6 × 10−40 C.
2.6 Electron and Ion Optics
Charged particles can be deﬂected and imaged by
properly designed electric or magnetic ﬁelds that act
on these particles in a similar way as lenses, mir-
rors and prisms act on light in optics. Such ﬁeld
arrangements are therefore named electron or ion op-
tics. They have allowed the development of electron
microscopes (Figs. 2.25–2.28) and mass spectrome-
ters (see Sect. 2.7). Since electron microscopes reach
a spatial resolution down to 0.1 nm they have become
indispensable for the investigations of small structures
in biological cells, material and surface phenomena and
molecular structure. Mass spectrometers play an im-
portant role in analyzing the atomic composition of
compounds, in measuring isotopic abundances, deter-
mining age in geology and archeology. They are used
to measure the absolute masses of atoms and molecules
and to deﬁne the absolute value of the atomic mass unit
AMU (see Sect. 2.2.1).
It is therefore worthwhile to study the basic princi-
ples of electron and ion optics.
2.6.1 Refraction of Electron Beams
An electric ﬁeld exerts a force on a particle with
charge q
F = qE = −q grad φel ,
(2.76)

2. The Concept of the Atom
which is always perpendicular to the equipotential
surfaces φel = const.
Assume a particle with mass m and charge q moves
with constant velocity v1 through a ﬁeld-free region
and enters at an angle α against the surface normal of
the planar boundary surface of a homogeneous electric
ﬁeld (Fig. 2.62).
Such an arrangement can be, for instance, realized
by four planar parallel metal grids kept at constant
potentials. Between grids 2 and 3 in Fig. 2.62 a homo-
geneous electric ﬁeld E = (φ1 −φ2)/d is maintained,
while in the regions above and below the electric ﬁeld
is E = 0. Energy conservation demands

while passing through the ﬁeld, the x-component of the
velocity remains unchanged. From Fig. 2.62 we realize
the relations: sin α = v1x/v1, sin β = v2x/v2 and be-
cause of v1x = v2x we obtain the law of refraction of
a parallel electron beam

refractive indices.

If the distance d between the grids at z = 0 and z = d
is sufﬁciently small, we can approximate the path of the
electron by two straight lines in the following way.
We extrapolate the straight path of the incident elec-
tron for z < 0 until the mid plane at z = d/2 and that
of the outgoing electron for z > d back to z = d/2
(dashed straight lines in Fig. 2.62). Then the anal-
ogy to the optical refraction at the boundary plane
between two media with refractive indices n1, n2 be-
comes more suggestive. According to (2.74) and (2.79)
we can attribute refractive indices to the electron optics
arrangement by the relation
n2
n1

sin β =

1 + V/V0 .
(2.80)
This shows that the ratio of the refractive indices
is solely determined by the potential difference
V = φ1 −φ2 and the initial energy (m/2)v2
1 =
eV0 of the incident electron.
The direction of a parallel electron beam can be al-
so changed by traversing a perpendicular electric ﬁeld
(Fig. 2.63). When electrons enter the homogeneous
ﬁeld Ez of a condenser at z = 0 with the velocity
v = {vx, 0, 0} the force F = qE gives a parabolic path

2.6.2 Electron Optics in Axially Symmetric Fields
We will now look at the imaging of electron beams in
inhomogeneous electric ﬁelds with axial symmetry.
From (2.76) one obtains with E = −grad φ and
without magnetic ﬁeld (B = 0) the basic equations:
m d2x
dt2 = e∂φ
∂x ,
m d2y
dt2 = e∂φ
∂y ,
m d2z
dt2 = e∂φ
∂z ,
(2.82)
which can be solved, at least numerically, if the po-
tential φ is determined by the arrangement of charged
metal surfaces. If there are no space charges, the
Laplace equation becomes:
∂2φ
∂x2 + ∂2φ
∂y2 + ∂2φ
∂z2 = 0 .
(2.83)
There is no analytical solution for the general case, but
there are, of course, always numerical ones.
Most of the electro-optic lenses are realized by axial
symmetric electric or magnetic ﬁelds, where the former
can be obtained by charged circular apertures or tubes,
which can be set at a freely selectable potential.
One example is given by Fig. 2.64 where two cylin-
drical tubes are connected with a voltage source that
sets the potentials φ1 and φ2 for the two tubes. The
equipotential surfaces are indicated by the dotted lines.
Depending on the values of φ1 and φ2 a collecting or
a diverging electron lens can be realized. The appro-
priate coordinates here are cylindrical coordinates r,
ϕ, z. Since the system is axially symmetric, the po-
tential cannot depend on the angle ϕ, but only on r
and z. While for r = 0 the derivative ∂φ/∂r = 0, this
is not the case for r ̸= 0. Therefore, a force acts on
those electrons that move away from the symmetry ax-
is. Electrons coming from the left side in Fig. 2.64 are
attracted towards the axis (note that the force is always

perpendicular to the dotted equipotential lines), while
they are driven away from the axis in the right tube.
For φ2 > φ1 the electrons are accelerated when moving
from the ﬁrst to the second tube. Their velocity is there-
fore larger at the right side as at the left one. This means
that the defocusing effect on the right side is smaller
than the focusing effect on the left side. The system
acts as a converging lens. For φ2 < φ1 the situation is
reversed and the system represents a diverging lens.
Let us prove more quantitatively the focusing effect
of an electric ﬁeld with axial symmetry. We use as an
example the potential
φ(r, z) = a

z2 −1


(2.84)
shown in Fig. 2.65, which is produced by two pairs
of axially symmetric hyperbolic electrodes, where the
z-axis is the symmetry axis. The electrodes are kept
at constant potentials φ = 0 and φ = φ0, respective-
ly. The general equipotential surfaces inside the system
are obtained by inserting φ = C into (2.84), which
yields

This proves that the equipotential surfaces φ = C are
hyperboloids around the symmetry axis r = 0 (z-axis).
Their minimum distance from the origin (r, z) = (0, 0)
is zH = √C/a for r = 0 and rH = √2C/a for z = 0.
The potential at the z-axis (r = 0) is:
φ(r = 0, z) = az2 ⇒
∂2φ

(2.86a)
Inserting this into (2.84) gives
φ(r, z) = φ(0, z) −1
4φ′′(0, z)r2 .
(2.86b)
It is therefore always possible to determine the
hyperbolic potential φ(r, z) at an arbitrary point
(r, ϕ, z) when its value φ(0, z) and its second
derivative φ′′(r = 0) = (∂2φ/∂z2)0 at the sym-
metry axis are known!
The radial components Er of the electric ﬁeld can
be obtained from (2.84) as
Er = −∂φ
∂r = ar .
(2.87)
Electrons away from the symmetry axis always experi-
ence a linear force
Fr = −eEr = −a · e · r ,
(2.88)
which drives them back to the axis. The r-component
of their movement therefore represents a harmonic
oscillation. Furthermore, all electrons that start from
a single point (z = z1,r = 0) on the symmetry axis are
again focused into a point (z = z2,r = 0) on the ax-
is, as long as their velocity components vz are equal,
even if the other components vr, vϕ differ for the differ-
ent electrons (Fig. 2.66). These properties of hyperbolic
potentials are used to realize ion traps.
The general axial symmetric potential will not nec-
essarily have hyperbolic equipotential surfaces. In or-
der to obtain its value φ(r, z) at points not too far from
the axis r = 0 from its values on the axis, we use the
Taylor expansion
φ(r, z) = φ(0, z) + b2(z)r2 + b4(z)r4 + . . . ,
(2.89)
where only terms with even powers of r can be non-
zero because of the axial symmetry (φ(−r) = φ(r)).
For small deviations from the axis (bnrn ≪φ(0, z))
we can neglect all higher order terms with n > 2.

reads in cylindrical coordinates as

The comparison with (2.86) shows that within this
paraxial approximation (b2(z)r2 ≪ϕ(0, z)) the same
relation exists for an arbitrary axially symmetric po-
tential (2.89) as for a hyperbolic potential.
This implies the remarkable fact that for all axial
symmetric potentials φ(r, z) the potential in an
arbitrary point not too far from the axis can
be calculated from its values φ(r = 0) and φ′′
(r = 0) at the axis.
The electron path in such ﬁelds can now be obtained
from the general equations (2.82), which reduce here to

dt2 = e∂φ

The radial component of the electron motion can
now differ from a harmonic oscillator, because the
restoring force Fr = a(z)r may change with z.
2.6.3 Electrostatic Electron Lenses
In Fig. 2.67 the path of an electron is shown schemat-
ically for a “thin lens,” where the extension d of the
electric ﬁeld is small compared to the focal length f .
Assume the electric ﬁeld is restricted to the space be-
tween the planes z = z1 and z = z2. In the left side
ﬁeld-free region the path is then a straight line, where
for paraxial rays, the angle α1 is small. Within the ﬁeld
region z1 ≤z ≤z2 the path is bent, but the distance r
from the axis does not vary much within the small inter-
val d, which implies that ra ≈rm ≈rb. From Fig. 2.67

It depends on the potential φ(z) and its second deriva-

0 = eφ0 of the incoming electrons.
Figure 2.68 shows two possible experimental real-
izations of such electrostatic lenses using plane grids
and apertures. The voltage V = φ1 −φ2 is applied be-
tween the grid and a circular aperture at a distance d
from the grid. The equipotential surfaces are axially
symmetric around the symmetry axis r = 0 (z-axis).
Since the electric ﬁeld E = −grad φ is perpendicu-
lar to these surfaces, the forces (F = −eE) acting on
the electrons is always perpendicular to the equipoten-
tial surfaces. If the circular aperture is, for instance,

Fig. 2.68. Electron lens consisting of an aperture and a grid
at different potentials. A parallel beam of electrons coming
from the right is focussed into the point F while the beam
diverges if it comes from the left
grounded (φ2 = 0) and the grid is set at a positive po-
tential (φ1 > 0), a parallel electron beam entering from
the right side into the system, is focused into the fo-
cal point F (Fig. 2.68a). The focal length f depends
on the voltage V = φ1 −φ2 and the kinetic energy of
the incoming electrons. While a parallel electron beam
entering from the left diverges (Fig. 2.68b).
The symmetrical arrangement of three apertures
in Fig. 2.69, with potentials φ1 = φ3 = 0 and φ2 ̸= 0
represents a combination of collimating and diverging
Fig. 2.69. Einzel lens realized by a symmetric arrangement
of three apertures at different potentials
lenses. Depending on the polarity of the applied voltage
between A2 and A1 or A2 and A3 either the collimat-
ing or the diverging inﬂuence dominates. For example,
with a positive voltage applied to A2 (φ2 > 0) the elec-
trons entering from the left are accelerated between A1
and A2 but decelerated between A2 and A3. The diverg-
ing effect then dominates and the whole system acts
as diverging lens, while for φ2 < 0 a collecting lens is
realized.
Electrostatic cylindrical lenses, which only focus in
one direction, can be, for instance, realized by a cylin-
drical condenser (Fig. 2.70), where the two cylindrical
surfaces are set at voltages +V/2 and −V/2, respec-
tively. Electrons passing through an entrance slit S0 and
entering the ﬁeld region with the energy eV0, are im-
aged onto a line S1 in the focal plane of the electron
lens, while the image line S2 of electrons with a dif-
ferent energy e(V0 + ΔV ) is spatially shifted from S1
to S2. The cylindrical condenser can therefore be used
as energy analyzer for electrons with an energy dis-
tribution N(E) (see Problem 2.15). The analogue in
optics is a cylindrical lens plus prism. The focal length
of the cylindrical condenser depends on the angle ϕ
and the voltage ±V/2 at the condenser surfaces has to
be adapted to the kinetic energy (m/2)v2 = eV0 of the
electrons. In the solution to Problem 2.15 it is shown
that the optimum path of the electrons through the
condensor is obtained for V = 2V0 ln(R2/R1), where
the Ri are the radii of the condenser plates.

dicular component v⊥=

component v∥is always perpendicular to the force F.
This means that the amount of v⊥remains constant, but
the direction of v changes. For vz = 0, the electron path
would be a circle with radius R, given by the balance
between the Lorentz and centrifugal forces:

For vz ̸= 0 the electron path is a helix with a pitch
Δz = T · vz. An electron starting from the axis r = 0
at z = 0 and t = 0 is imaged onto a point z = vz · T
onto the axis.
Any homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld (which can be,
for instance, obtained by a current I ﬂowing through
a cylindrical coil) represents an electron lens, which
focuses all electrons starting from a point z = 0 on the
z-axis into the focal point

Therefore, electrons accelerated by a voltage V all have
approximately the same velocity vz ≈v = √2eV/m.

Besides such longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds transverse
ﬁelds can also be used as magnetic lenses for imaging
of electron or ion beams. A transverse sector ﬁeld with
sector angle 2ϕ, shown in Fig. 2.72 represents a cylin-
drical lens, which focuses all electrons or ions starting
from the entrance slit S1, into a line S2 parallel to S1,
where both S1 and S2 are located in a plane passing
through the point M, which is the center of the circular
electron or ion path in the magnetic ﬁeld. This can be
seen as follows.
We divide the sector ﬁeld in Fig. 2.72 into two
half parts and regard in Fig. 2.73 only the right half.
Ions in a parallel ion beam entering the ﬁeld from the
left, traverse the ﬁelds on circular paths with a radius
R = mv/(qB) where q is the charge of the ions (or the
electrons). The center of the circular path SA0 for ions
in the middle of the parallel beam with width b is de-
noted by M0, the center M1 for ions entering on the
path 1 is shifted upwards by b/2. The ions on the cen-
ter path SA0 have been deﬂected by the angle ϕ when
leaving the ﬁeld, while those on path S1 by (ϕ + α).

The straight paths after leaving the ﬁeld are always per-
pendicular to the radius M0A0 or M1A1, respectively.
This implies that the straight lines are inclined against
each other by an angle α. They intersect at the point F.
The distance g0 = A0F is then:
g0 = A0A1
tan α
= M0A1 −M0A0

(2.101)
For the triangle ΔM1A1M0 we obtain with M0A0 = R
the relation
M0A1 = sin(ϕ + α)
sin ϕ

This yields
A0A1 = M0A1 −R = R

≈R(cos α −1 + cot ϕ sin α) .
(2.103)
For small angles α the approximation cos α ≈1 and
sin α ≈tan α holds. This gives
g0 = A0A1
sin α ≈R cot ϕ .
(2.104)
The distance g0 is nearly independent of the width b
of the ingoing beam as long as b ≪R. Then all ions
in the beam are focused into the point F, which is the
focal point. From (2.104) and the rectangular triangle
ΔM0A0F (with the 90◦angle at A0) it follows that the
angle ̸ M0F A0 equals ϕ, which implies that the line
F M0 is parallel to the direction of the incoming beam.
Similar to the treatment of thick lenses in geomet-
rical optics we can deﬁne a principal plane DH at
x = D where the extrapolated lines of the incoming
center ray S and the outgoing straight line A0F inter-
sect. The focal length f0 of the magnetic sector ﬁeld is
then deﬁned as the distance f0 = H F. With the rela-
tion H D = R and sin ϕ = H D/H F we obtain for the
focal length of one half sector ﬁeld
f0 =
R
sin ϕ .
(2.105)
The focal length of a magnetic sector ﬁeld with
a full sector angle 2ϕ is the ratio of radius of
curvature R and sin ϕ. For 2ϕ = 180◦⇒f0 = R
When we now reﬂect the sector in Fig. 2.73 at the
plane x = 0 and add this mirror image to the sector
in Fig. 2.73 we obtain the arrangement of Fig. 2.72.
Ions that start as a divergent beam from the slit S1 form
a parallel beam at the symmetry plane through M in
Fig. 2.72 and are therefore, according to the forego-
ing discussion, imaged onto S2. From (2.104) and the
rectangular triangle DH F in Fig. 2.73 it follows that
∢A0F M0 = ϕ and that S1, M and S2 must lie on the
same straight line.
In the direction perpendicular to the drawing plane
of Fig. 2.72 (i.e., parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld) no
focusing occurs. This means that for particle paths
parallel to the plane z = 0 (z gives the direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld) every point in the entrance slit
is imaged onto its corresponding image point in S2,
quite analogous to the situation for cylindrical lenses
in optics.
For more details on electron- and ion optics see the
text books [2.43–45].
2.6.5 Applications of Electron and Ion Optics
The applications of electron optics can be illustrat-
ed by the example of a modern transmission electron
microscope, shown in Fig. 2.74. The incident paral-
lel electron beam is transmitted through a thin slice of
the sample. The electrons suffer elastic and inelastic
collision with the atoms and molecules of the sample.
Since the energy loss by inelastic collisions depends on

the kind of atoms it can be used to analyze the atomic
composition of the sample.
In order to measure this energy loss, the transmitted
electrons are focused by an electron lens system into
a ﬁrst focal plane. The focal point serves as point like
source for the following magnetic sector ﬁeld, where
the electrons are deﬂected to the left and reﬂected
by an electrostatic mirror, realized by an electro-optic
system at negative potential. The reﬂected electrons
pass through the magnetic ﬁeld again and are deﬂect-
ed according to their reversed velocity. Electrons with
differing energies are imaged at different positions x in
the focal plane. A movable aperture selects only those
electrons with the wanted energy. One may select the
elastically scattered electrons or those that suffered in-
elastic collisions with a selectable energy loss in the
sample. This selection enhances the contrast of the ﬁ-
nal magniﬁed image and allows one to ﬁlter selected
parts of the sample, e.g., spots containing heavy atoms
that cause larger energy losses [2.46–48].
Further examples of applications of ion optics are
the various kinds of mass spectrometers that will be
discussed in the following section.
2.7 Atomic Masses
and Mass Spectrometers
After having discussed in the previous sections exper-
imental methods for the determination of atomic sizes
and electrical properties of atoms we will now deal with
the measurement of atomic masses [2.49–52].
The most simple method for measuring atomic
masses is based on the knowledge of Avogadro’s con-
stant NA. When the mass M of a mole of atoms x
in a gas is measured (it has a volume of 22.4 dm3 at
p=1033 hPa and T= 0 ◦C), the mass mx of an atom is
mx = M/NA .
If the relative atomic mass
A = 12
mx
m
"12C
#
in AMU is known (see Sect. 2.2.1) then the absolute
mass mx is directly obtained from M = A · 10−3 kg as
mx = A · 10−3
NA
kg
without further measurements.
The mass mx = M/N of atoms in a regular crystal
with mass M is determined from the total number N of
atoms in the crystal that can be obtained from the ge-
ometry of the crystal and the distances between crystal
planes measured by X-ray diffraction (see Sect. 2.4.4).
The most accurate method for the determina-
tion of atomic masses is, however, based on the
deﬂection of ions in electric or magnetic ﬁelds.

54
2. The Concept of the Atom
From the measured mass m(A+) of an atomic ion,
the mass of the neutral atom is
m(A) = m(A+) + m(e−) −1
c2 EB ,
(2.106)
where the last term (which is generally neglected) rep-

of the electron in the atom A.
It is quite instructive to brieﬂy follow the histor-
ical development and gradual improvement of mass
spectrometers, in order to appreciate the work of our
scientiﬁc ancestors and to understand why modern
devices are more accurate.
2.7.1 J.J. Thomson’s Parabola Spectrograph
Ions with charge q are produced in a gas discharge, are
accelerated by a voltage V and pass in the z-direction
through a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B = {Bx, 0, 0},
which is superimposed by a homogeneous electric ﬁeld
E = {Ex, 0, 0} (Fig. 2.75). The equations of motion are
then with Bx = B; Ex = E

The time t can be eliminated by using the relations

(2.111b)
For a given initial velocity v = (2q V/m)1/2 = vz
every ion hits a point {x(z0), y(z0)} at the photo plate,
which depends on the ratio q/m. In the original mass
spectrograph by Thomson, the ions were produced in
a gas discharge and had a broad velocity distribution.
They therefore arrive at different points (x(z0), y(z0)),
depending on their velocity. In order to ﬁnd a rela-
tion between x(z0) and y(z0) one has to eliminate v.
Solving (2.111b) for v and inserting this expression
into (2.111a) gives the relation
x(z0) = m

y2 = a(m)y2 .
(2.112)
This represents a separate parabola x = ay2 for every
value of m/q (Fig. 2.76a). Measuring this parabola al-
lows the determination of the factor a and therefore
the ratio q/m. Figure 2.76b shows for illustration that
such parabolas are obtained for different isotopes of
neon ions from a gas discharge, where water vapor and
benzene vapor had also been added for calibration pur-
poses since they deliver H+, C+, CH+, O+, OH+ and
H2O+ ions.
According to (2.111), the velocity spread Δv corre-
sponds to a length Δsp of the parabola given by

This spread decreases the sensitivity of photographic

Note:
The equations (2.111a) and (2.111b) show that
the deﬂection x of a charged particle by an elec-
tric ﬁeld is inversely proportional to its kinetic
energy, while in the magnetic ﬁeld it is inversely
proportional to its momentum mv. The deﬂection
in electric ﬁelds is therefore a measure of the ki-
netic energy that in a magnetic ﬁeld is a measure
of the momentum of the particle.
2.7.2 Velocity-Independent Focusing
In Thomson’s mass spectrograph, ions of equal masses
but different velocities were spread out along a parabo-
la. This diminishes the intensity of the ions impinging
onto a speciﬁc point (x, y) on the photoplate. One
would obtain a much higher signal if all ions of
equal mass could be focused onto the same spot (for
Fig. 2.76a,b. The ions

2. The Concept of the Atom
instance the entrance aperture of an ion detector) in-
dependent of their velocity. This can be achieved by
the mass spectrograph constructed by Francis William
Aston (1877–1945). Here the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld regions are spatially separated (Fig. 2.77) and the
direction of the ﬁelds is chosen in such a way that the
deﬂections of the ions are in opposite directions. The
incident ion beam is collimated by the two slits S1
and S2 parallel to the y-direction and enters the elec-
tric ﬁeld as a parallel beam in the z-direction. The
deﬂection angle α of the beam by the electric ﬁeld is,
according to (2.110)
tan α =
dx
dz

L1/2
= qEL1
mv2
(2.114a)
while the deﬂection angle β caused by the magnetic
ﬁeld is
tan β = qBL2
mv
.
(2.114b)
For small deﬂection angles (tan α ≪1, tan β ≪1)
we can approximate tan α ≈α, tan β ≈β and derive
from (2.114a), (2.114b) the relations:
dα
dv = −2qEL1
mv3
= −2α
v and
(2.114c)
dβ
dv = −qBL2
mv2 = −β
v .
(2.114d)
The lateral deﬂection by the electric ﬁeld is
DE = −(a + b) · tan α ≈−(a + b) · α
and by the magnetic ﬁeld
DM = b · tan(β −α) + b · tan β ≈b · β
The total lateral deﬂection D of the ions against the
z-axis is then approximately (see Fig. 2.77)
D ≈−(a + b)α + bβ .
(2.115)
For dD/dv = 0 the deﬂection becomes independent of
the ion velocity v. This yields
−(a + b)dα
dv + bdβ
dv = +2(a + b)α
v
−bβ
v = 0
⇒βb = 2(a + b)α ⇒D = +(a + b)α . (2.116)
This must be valid for all masses m i.e. for all
angles α = qE · L1/mv2, which means for all points
of the photoplate surface. This can be fullﬁlled, if the
photoplate is arranged in a plane that is inclined by the
angle α against the z-direction and that intersects the
z-axis in the middle of the electric ﬁeld (see Fig. 2.77).
The slit S3 deﬁnes a range Δα of deﬂection angles α
around a medium value αm, which deﬁnes the position
of the photoplate. This means, that not all ions with
vastly differing velocities are transmitted but only those
within a selectable range Δv. Velocity-independent
focusing therefore means:
z = 0

2.7. Atomic Masses and Mass Spectrometers

All ions with velocities within the interval vm −
Δv/2 up to vm + Δv/2 are imaged onto a small
spot with diameter Δs on the photoplate. The
value of Δs is much smaller than in Thomson’s
parabola spectrograph, which implies that one re-
ally wins in intensity (number of ions impinging
per time onto a given spatial interval Δs).
2.7.3 Focusing of Ions
with Different Angles of Incidence
Up to here we have assumed that the incident ions form
a parallel beam in the z-direction. Although this can be
approximately realized by apertures the loss in intensi-
ty quadratically increases with increasing collimation.
It is therefore highly desirable if the ions with different
directions of their initial velocities could be refocused
and therefore contribute to the signal without loss of
mass resolution.
This goal was ﬁrst realized by Arthur Jeffrey
Dempster (1886–1950) who built a magnetic sector
ﬁeld with 2ϕ = 180◦where the ion paths are half-
circles with radius R = mv/(q B). As is shown in
Fig. 2.78a all ions passing through the entrance slit A
within the angular range from −α to +α against the
y-axis are imaged onto the exit plane y = 0 within
a small interval Δx ≈Rα2. This can be understood
from the relations obvious from Fig. 2.78a:
AC = 2R ;
AB = 2R cos α ≈2R

1 −α2/2

⇒Δs = AC −AB ≈Rα2 .
EXAMPLE
R =10 cm, α =3◦= 0.05 rad ⇒Δs =2.5 × 10−2 cm.
Placing a 0.25-mm wide slit in the exit plane allows
all incident ions with equal ratios q/m, but velocity di-
rections ranging from −3◦to +3◦, to be transmitted
through the slit.
As has been shown in Sect. 2.6.4, magnetic sector

The comparison of the 180◦magnetic sector ﬁeld
with the cylindric electric condenser reveals (see
Problem 2.15) that both ﬁelds act the same way as
cylindrical lenses, if the sector angle ϕm is replaced by
ϕel = ϕm/
√
2. The magnetic 180◦sector ﬁeld therefore
corresponds to a 127.3◦electric cylinder condenser
(Fig. 2.78b).
2.7.4 Mass Spectrometer with Double Focusing
When using a combination of electric and magnetic
sector ﬁelds with proper sector angles, simultaneous
velocity and directional focusing can be achieved, as
shown in the example in Fig. 2.79. The incident ion
beam passing the entrance slit has an angular diver-
gence of ±Δα. Behind the cylindrical condenser the
slit S2 selects ions with charge q of within the energy

range E ± ΔE. Since all ions have been accelerated by
the same voltage V before reaching S1 they all should
have the same energy q · V . Their energy spread comes
about because their thermal velocity distribution in the
ion source has to be added to their acceleration energy.
This spreads the ions with slightly different veloci-
ties over a spatial interval in the plane of slit S2. The
slit width of S2 determines the energy interval ΔE of
those ions entering the magnetic sector ﬁeld, where the
mass separation takes place, because the magnetic ﬁeld
separates ions with different momenta mv = √2mqE,
see (2.73). Both ﬁelds focus divergent ion beams if
the sector angles ϕel and ϕm have been chosen cor-
rectly as has been shown in the previous sections. For
ϕel = π/
√
2 all ions with energies within the interval
E + ΔE, which pass through S1, are imaged onto S2.
For the magnetic sector angle ϕm = 60◦S2 is then
imaged with a focal length fm = R/ sin 30◦= 2R =
2mv/(qB) onto the photoplate or a slit S3 in front of
the detector. The imaging of ions with different veloc-
ities is achieved in ﬁrst order in the same way as in
Aston’s spectrometer, because the deﬂections in both
ﬁelds are in opposite directions.
For an illustration of the achievable resolution
m/Δm = 6 × 103, Fig. 2.80 shows a section of a mass
spectrum of different masses around AMU = 20, mea-
sured with such a double-focusing spectrograph. Their
masses differ only by small fractions of 1 AMU, due to
different mass defects of the individual nuclei.
2.7.5 Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer
The basic principle of a time-of-ﬂight (TOF) mass
spectrometer is simple (Fig. 2.81). At time t = 0 ions
are produced in a small volume (for example the cross-
ing volume of a laser beam and a molecular beam).
They are accelerated by a voltage V to a velocity v =
(2qV/m)1/2 where m is their mass and q their charge.
The ions drift through a ﬁeld-free region of length L
before they are detected. Measuring the time delay
between ion production at t = 0 and mass-dependent
arrival time
tm = L
v =
L
√2qV/m
(2.117a)
at the detector gives the mass m of the ion:

EXAMPLE
L =1 m, V =1 kV, m =100 AMU=1.6 × 10−25 kg,
q =e =1.6 × 10−19 C ⇒tm = 52 μs.
The accuracy of mass determination depends on
how accurate the distance L, the time of ﬂight Tm, and
the acceleration voltage can be measured. The mass
resolution m/Δm depends on the shortest time inter-
val Δt that can still be resolved. From (2.117b) we
obtain
Δm
m
= 2Δt
tm
.
(2.117c)
Since the time resolution Δt cannot be better than the
initial time spread, the duration Δt0 of the initial ion
pulse should be as short as possible. If the ions are, for
instance, formed through photo-ionization by a short
laser pulse of Δt0 = 10−8 s, the initial pulse width is
short compared to the ﬂight time and can therefore
often be neglected.
EXAMPLE
Δt0 =10−8 s, tm =50 μs ⇒Δm/m = 4 × 10−4. This
means that two masses m1 = 2500 AMU and m2 =
2501 AMU can be still separated.
Another problem arises because the ions are not all
produced at the same location, but within a ﬁnite vol-
ume. The electric ﬁeld used to extract the ions varies
over this volume and therefore the kinetic energy, the
ions acquire by the extraction voltage, varies accord-
ingly. Therefore, the velocities of ions, produced at
different locations, differ, which smears out the arrival
times and limits the mass resolution.
In order to improve this, a modiﬁcation of the ex-
traction ﬁeld was introduced by McLaren et al. [2.54],
where the acceleration occurs in two steps. This can
be achieved by three plane grids kept at the potentials
φ1, φ2, and φ3 = 0 with distances d1 and d2 (Fig. 2.82)
and homogeneous ﬁelds E1 = (φ2 −φ1)/d1, E2 =
(φ3 −φ2)/d2 between the grids.
Assume the x-axis to be the symmetry axis of the
spectrometer. An ion produced at the distance x1 from
grid 2 has a ﬂight time t1 until it reaches the grid 2. We
obtain for ions starting at x = d1 −x1 with a velocity

At grid 3 with potential φ3 the velocity has increased to

where t2 is the ﬂight time from G2 to G3. Integration
yields the relation between the distance d2 and the
ﬂight times t1, t2 and the electric ﬁelds E1, E2

The solution of the quadratic equation in t2 gives
t2 = t2(t1, E1, E2).
The drift time across the ﬁeld-free region is then
t3 = L/v2 and the total time of ﬂight
t = t1 + t2 + t3 .
Inserting t2 and v2 gives the total times t as a
function of t1, E1, E2.
If t should be independent of the location x of ion
production, one has to demand dt/dx1 = 0. Inserting
t1, t2, and t3 into (2.119) and taking the derivative
dt/dx1 yields the optimum ﬂight path length Lopt in
the ﬁeld-free region from G3 to the detector

where V1 = φ2 −φ1 and V2 = φ3 −φ2 are the poten-
tial differences between the grids in Fig. 2.82. It is
therefore possible to construct the spectrometer in such
a way that the distance from ion source to detector
equals the optimum ﬂight distance Lopt where the to-
tal ﬂight time is the same for all ions independent of
the location where they are produced. In Fig. 2.82b the
total ﬂight times of these ions produced at different dis-
tances x1 from grid φ2 are illustrated. Ions with larger
values of x1 have larger ﬂight paths to the detector but
also gain higher kinetic energies because they are pro-
duced at a higher potential φ(x). Therefore they pass
the slower ions produced at smaller x after a total ﬂight
time t2 at a total distance x(t2) = Lopt + d2 + x1 from
their production point. That is where the detector has to
be placed.
The advantages of time-of-ﬂight spectrometers are
the following:
•
It is possible to measure all mass components of
a mixture of different species
•
Even atoms or molecules with very large mass-
es
(for
example
biological
molecules
with
m ≤105 AMU) can be detected, although they have
a correspondingly long ﬂight time and the ion de-
tector needs a high acceleration voltage to achieve a
sufﬁcient secondary electron emission coefﬁcient.
•
The TOF design is simple and easy to construct.
It is much cheaper than other types of mass
spectrometer.
The mass resolution of TOF can be considerably in-
creased if the ions are reﬂected at the end of the drift
distance L by an electrostatic reﬂector, which consists
of grids at a positive voltage producing an electric ﬁeld
that repels the ions (Fig. 2.83). Ions entering the ﬁeld
under an incident angle α against the ﬁeld direction are
reﬂected into an angle 2α against their incident direc-
tion, where they reach the detector after a further drift
distance L. The faster ions penetrate deeper into the re-
ﬂecting ﬁeld and therefore travel a larger distance, just
compensating for an earlier arrival time at the reﬂecting
ﬁeld. This device, called a “reﬂectron” [2.55], achieves
the same total travel time for all ions within a veloci-
ty interval Δv (see also Problem 2.16e). Time-of-ﬂight
spectrometers are particularly useful in combination
with photo-ionisation by short-pulse lasers, because
here start time and ionization volume are precisely
deﬁned [2.56].
For illustration, Fig. 2.84 shows the TOF mass spec-
trum of Nan clusters [2.57]. These are loosely bound
compounds of n sodium atoms. Such clusters are of
current interest, since they allow detailed studies of
the transition regime between free molecules and liquid
droplets or solid micro particles.

2.7.6 Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer
In Sect. 2.6.2 it was shown that an axially symmetric
hyperbolic electrostatic ﬁeld causes focusing or defo-
cusing of charged particles, depending on the polarity
of the applied dc voltage. The quadrupole mass spec-
trometer developed in 1953 by Wolfgang Paul (1913–
1994), (Nobel Prize 1992) and H. Steinwedel [2.58]
uses a hyperbolic potential

x2 −z2
,
(2.121)
which is not axially symmetric. It is, however, invari-
ant against translation in the y-direction. It is formed
by four metal electrodes with hyperbolic inner surfaces,
where two opposite electrodes are electrically connect-
ed and are kept at the potential ±φ0/2 (Fig. 2.85b).
Note the difference between the potential diagram of
Fig. 2.85a and that of Fig. 2.65. While the latter has
axial symmetry around the z-axis and is generated by
electrodes with cylindrical symmetry, the potential in
Fig. 2.85a has no axial symmetry, although the diagram
looks similar. The reason for this difference is due to
the rods, forming the electrodes, which extend linearly
into the y-direction and Fig. 2.85a just shows the poten-
tial in an arbitrary plane y = y0, while all electrodes in
Fig. 2.61 have axial symmetry around the z-axis.
The ions are formed in an ion source and are ac-
celerated by a voltage U0 before they enter the mass
spectrometer and ﬂy into the y-direction. With a time-
independent constant voltage U = φ0 between neigh-
boring electrodes the ﬁeld component Ex = −φ0x/r2
0
causes a force Fx = +qEx that drives the ions back to
the center x = 0. The ions therefore perform harmonic
oscillations in the xy-plane. Because of the opposite
polarity of the ﬁeld component Ez = +φ0z/r2
0 the
force component Ez = qEz is directed away from the
center z = 0 and the ions are driven away from the cen-
tral axis z = 0 along their ﬂight in y-direction. Their
movement in the yz-plane is therefore instable and such
a dc device would not be useful. However, using a trick

2. The Concept of the Atom
the ions can be stabilized in both directions, if in ad-
dition to the dc voltage U an ac voltage V cos ωt is
applied to the electrodes. The potential φ then becomes
φ0(t) = U + V cos ωt .
(2.122)
The polarity of the electrodes changes periodically.
This means that within a half-period of the ac ﬁeld
the ions are stabilized in the x-direction and destabi-
lized in the z-direction while in the next half period the
situation is just reversed. Before the ions during their
destabilization period can ﬂy too far away from the axis
they are stabilized again and are brought back. It can be
shown mathematically, that on the time average this de-
vice leads to a stabilization in both directions for ions of
a selected mass, but to a destabilization for ions of dif-
ferent masses. The mass selection is determined by the
frequency ω and the ratio U/V of dc and ac amplitude.
The equations of motion for the ions are

(2.125a)

dτ 2 −(a + 2b cos 2τ)z = 0 .
(2.125b)
The parameter a represents twice the ratio of the ion’s
potential energy qV in the dc ﬁeld to the average kinet-
ic energy (m/2)v2 = mr2
0ω2/2 of its oscillation in the
ac ﬁeld, while b gives the average ratio of Epot to Ekin
in the ac ﬁeld.
Mathieu’s equations have stable and unstable so-
lutions depending on the values of the parameters a
and b.
The stable solutions describe oscillations of the
ions with limited amplitude. These ions pass through
the quadruple spectrometer in the y-directions without
hitting the electrodes.
The unstable solutions describe ions with oscilla-
tion amplitudes in the x- or z-direction, which expo-
nentially increase while the ion is moving into the
y-directions. The ion hits the electrodes before it can

The stable regions can be represented in the a–
b-diagram of Fig. 2.86. Note, that the conditions for
stability solely depend on the parameters a and b and
not on the initial conditions of the ions. Choosing the
optimum combination of a and b allows one to transmit

the wanted mass m and to suppress all other masses.
This is illustrated by Fig. 2.86b, where the ﬁrst sta-
bility region for both the x- and z-direction limited
by a < 0.237 and b < 0.9 is plotted on an expanded
scale. For given values of U and V the different mass-
es all lie on the straight line a/b = 2U/V = const,
as can be seen from (2.124). The position of a mass
mi = 4qU/

ar2

depends for a mass spectrometer
with ﬁxed values of r0 and ω0 on the parameter a.
Only those ions that have masses within the stable re-
gion reach the detector. For our example in Fig. 2.86b
these are the masses m1 and m2. The closer the straight
lines approaches the peak of the stability region, the
smaller is the mass range Δm transmitted to the detec-
tor. Selecting the ratio a/b therefore allows one to set
the mass range of transmitted ions, which determines
the mass resolution of the spectrometer. The mass res-
olution m/Δm of the quadruple mass spectrometer can
therefore be easily adjusted (within certain limits) by
choosing the appropriate ratio U/V of dc voltage U
and ac amplitude V [2.59].
2.7.7 Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance Spectrometer
This type of mass spectrometer was developed in 1965
and since then has been greatly improved. Today it rep-
resents the device with the highest accuracy in absolute
mass measurements and the highest mass resolution
(m/Δm ≥108!).
Its basic design [2.60] is illustrated in Fig. 2.87.
It consists of an axially symmetric hyperbolic electric
ﬁeld (like that in Fig. 2.65) with the z-axis as sym-
metry axis, superimposed by a homogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld B in the z-direction. The ions, produced in an ion
source are injected into the device and then the elec-
tric ﬁeld is switched on. The electric ﬁeld stabilizes the
ion in z-direction and the magnetic ﬁeld causes them
to move on circles around the magnetic ﬁeld lines,
thus stabilizing them in the radial directions (x- and
y-directions). In order to avoid collisions of the ions
with the background gas atoms the vacuum has to be
very good (p < 10−16 Pa). Without the electric ﬁeld
the ions with an initial velocity v = {vx, vy, 0} would
move on circles with radius R = mv/(q B). The angu-
lar velocity (see Sect. 2.7.4)

is the cyclotron frequency. It is independent of the
radius R.
The electric ﬁeld is formed by hyperbolic elec-
trodes, consisting of two hyperbolic caps and one ring
symmetric around the z-axis. A positive voltage at the
caps stabilizes the ions in the z-direction. The axial-
ly symmetric electric ﬁeld has the components (see
Sect. 2.6.2).

Without a magnetic ﬁeld the ions would perform har-
monic oscillations in the ±z-direction, due to the linear
restoring force qEz, but they were not stabilized in the
radial direction. The superposition of the homogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld Bz stabilizes the ions in all directions but
their movement becomes more complicated (Fig. 2.88).
It can be composed of the cyclotron movement (circles
around an axis in the z-direction), a second component,
where the center of these circles performs oscillations
in the ±z-direction (axial oscillations) and a third com-
ponent, where the center of the circles undergoes a slow
drift on a large circle around the z-axis (magnetron
movement).

is determined by the cyclotron frequency ωc (2.93) and
the frequency ωel of the harmonic oscillation due to the
electric ﬁeld. The periodic ion movement induces an ac
voltage U(t) at the caps, which can be used to monitor
the frequency of this movement.
The Fourier transform

U(t)ei(ω−ω±)t dt

of the measured voltage exhibits sharp peaks at ω =
ω+ and ω = ω−, which allows the accurate determina-
tion of the cyclotron frequency ωc and therefore, using
(2.126), the ion mass as well, if the magnetic ﬁeld B
is known. The magnetic ﬁeld can be calibrated using
12C+ ions because their mass represents the unit of the
atomic mass scale (see Sect. 2.2.1).
As an illustration of the achievable accuracy,
Fig. 2.89 shows the resonance peak around the fre-
quency ω+ of 133Cs+ ions, which has a line width
of only 0.3 Hz (!) at a cyclotron frequency ωc = 2π ·
685,075.6 Hz. The central frequency can be determined
within ±0.05 Hz, which implies, according to (2.93),
an accuracy of m/Δm ≥108 [2.61].
2.7.8 Isotopes
Measurements of atomic weights with chemical meth-
ods (Sect. 2.1) brought the result that most of the
natural chemical elements have atomic mass numbers
x AMU, where x generally is close to an integer. For

some elements, however, large deviations from an in-
teger were found. The explanation of these ﬁndings
became possible through accurate measurements of
the atomic masses with mass spectrometers. These
measurements showed that most chemical elements in
nature consist of a mixture of components with slightly
different masses, differing from each other by one or
a few atomic mass units. These components of a chem-
ical element have exactly the same chemical properties,
their only difference lies in their masses. They were
called isotopes.
EXAMPLES
1. The natural isotopic abundance of oxygen is
99.75% 16O with 16 AMU and 0.2% of 18O with
18 AMU. The average mass number (weighted
without isotope separation) is therefore 0.9975 ×
16 + 0.002 × 18 = 16.005 AMU.
2. Natural chlorine consists of 77.5% 35Cl and 24.5%
37Cl, which gives an average mass number of
0.755 × 35 + 0.245 × 37 = 35.49 AMU.
The atomic mass number of each isotope is writ-
ten as an upper left index before the chemical symbol,
whereas the number of its electrons, which determines
its chemical properties, is written as a lower left index.
Then 37
17Cl is a chlorine isotope with 17 electrons and
a mass of 37 AMU.

2.8. The Structure of Atoms
65
The real explanation for isotopes was only possi-
ble after the discovery of the neutron in 1932. It then
became clear, that the atomic nucleus (see Sect. 2.8)
consists of positively charged particles, called protons,
and neutral particles, called neutrons. The total charge
of all protons cancels that of all electrons in the atom.
Isotopes only differ in their number of neutrons.
Figure 2.90 shows the abundances of the molybde-
num isotopes measured with a high-resolution double-
focusing mass spectrometer.

2.8 The Structure of Atoms
The experiments discussed so far, have given us infor-
mation on the size and masses of atoms and also on
the fact that neutral atoms carry negative and positive
charges. How these charges are distributed over the vol-
ume of an atom was only discovered in 1911 by the
scattering experiments of Rutherford and his group.
Such scattering experiments can also give informa-
tion on the interaction potential between two colliding
atoms and its dependence on the distance between the
collision partner. We will therefore discuss in this sec-
tion the scattering of particles by each other and the
atomic models resulting from such experiments.
2.8.1 Integral and Differential Cross Sections
When a parallel beam of particles A with a particle
ﬂux density ˙N = dN/dt pass per second and unit area
in the x-direction through a layer with thickness dx,
which contains particles B with a particle density nB
(Fig. 2.91a) a fraction of the incident particles A will
Fig. 2.91. (a) Scattering of atoms A by atoms B with number
density nB in a layer with thickness dx. (b) Illustration of the
collision cross section by circles with radius r = rA + rB
be scattered out of the original x-direction due to their
collisions with particles B. The deﬂection angle at
such a collision depends on many parameters: the dis-
tance between A and B, the interaction potential, the
masses mA and mB, and the relative velocity vA −vB.
If the number nB dx of scattering particles B along
the path dx is sufﬁciently small, each particle A will
pass, during its way through dx, at most one atom B
closely enough to be scattered by a measurable angle.
This means multiple scattering can be neglected.
We deﬁne the integral scattering cross section σint
for scattering of particles A by particles B as that
area σint = πr2 around B, through which A has
to pass in order to be deﬂected by an angle Θ
larger than the minimum detectable deﬂection
angle Θmin (Fig. 2.91b and 2.88a).
Due to these deﬂections, the particle ﬂux density ˙N
decreases over the distance dx by
d ˙N = −˙NσintnB dx .
(2.130)
Dividing by ˙N and integrating over dx gives the par-
ticle ﬂux after having passed a distance x through the
scattering region
˙N(x) = ˙N(0) e−nBσintx .
(2.131)
The integral cross section is related to the mean
free path length  (for particles B at rest) by (see
Problem 2.17)

2. The Concept of the Atom
 = 1
nσ .
(2.132)
A possible experimental realization for measuring in-
tegral scattering cross sections is shown in Fig. 2.92a.
The incident beam of particles A is collimated by two
slits S1, S2 and passes either through a thin foil of
atoms B (in the case of fast particles A which can pen-
etrate the foil) or through a gaseous sample restricted
to a volume V with thickness dx. Such a volume is re-
alized either by a differentially pumped cell with holes
for the entrances and exit of the beam A or by a sec-
ond collimated beam of particle B, which crosses the
beam A perpendicularly (Fig. 2.92b). In the case of a
differentially pumped cell, the particles B, which effuse
through the holes of the cell have to be pumped away
in order to maintain sufﬁciently low pressures outside
the cell so that collisions of atoms A only occur inside
the deﬁned volume of the cell but not outside.
The detector is located behind a third slit S3, that
transmits only those particles A that have not been
deﬂected by collisions.
More information is obtained by measuring that
fraction of the incident particles A, that is scattered into
a deﬁned solid angle dΩ, and which is determined by
the differential cross section.

Fig. 2.92. (a) Measurement of the integral cross section σ.
(b) Measurement of the differential cross section dσ/dΩ
While for the determination of the integral cross
section, the decrease of the intensity of the in-
cident particles A (that is, the unscattered parti-
cles) is measured, the differential cross section
dσ(Θ)/dΩ is a measure for those particles that
have been deﬂected by a certain angle Θ into the
solid angle dΩ.
We will now derive an expression for the differen-
tial cross section.
Assume
˙N A incident particles pass per second
through the area A in the scattering volume V = A·Δx,
and Δ ˙N(Θ, Ω) is the rate of particles scattered by
a deﬂection angle Θ and detected by the detector with
an acceptance solid angle ΔΩ. Then
Δ ˙N
˙N A = nB
A V dσ
dΩ ΔΩ = nBΔx dσ
dΩ ΔΩ
(2.133)
is the fraction of incident particles that is scattered in-
to the solid angle ΔΩ accepted by the detector. It is
determined by the particle density nB of scatterers B,
the length Δx which the incident beam of particles A
traverse through the scattering volume V and the differ-
ential scattering cross section dσ/dΩ which depends
on the interaction potential between particles A and B.
For measuring dσ/dΩ the setup of Fig. 2.92b can
be used. Two beams, collimated by the apertures S1
and S2 cross each other in the scattering volume V =
AΔx. The particles A scattered by an angle Θ into the
solid angle of ΔΩ are monitored by the detector with
sensitive area AD = R2ΔΩ in a distance R from the
scattering volume V where R ≫Δx.
We will now look into the relation between Epot(r)
and dσ/dΩ in more detail.
2.8.2 Basic Concepts of Classical Scattering
As is generally shown in classical mechanics, the
movements of two particles with masses m1, m2,
velocities v1, v2 and a mutual interaction potential
Epot(|r1 −r2|) can be represented in the center of mass
coordinate frame as the movement of a single particle
with reduced mass
μ =
m1m2
m1 + m2

2.8. The Structure of Atoms
67
and relative velocity v = v1 −v2 in a potential Epot(r),
where r = |r1 −r2| is the distance between the two
particles. The description of the scattering of the two
particles by each other in this center of mass frame
is named “potential scattering,” because it demands,
besides the reduced mass μ and the initial condi-
tions (r0, v0) solely the knowledge of the interaction
potential Epot(r).
We will here restrict the discussion to the most sim-
ple case of spherically symmetric potentials Epot(r),
which is adequate for many real collision events. In
such a potential, the angular momentum L of the par-
ticle remains constant (see Problem 2.20). This implies
that the path of the particle is planar. It always stays
within the so-called “scattering plane.” Therefore, po-
lar coordinates (r, ϕ) are best suited for the description
of the particles time-dependent position. The deﬂection
angle of our particles, measured in the center of mass
frame is named ϑ, while it is described by Θ in the
laboratory frame (Fig. 2.93).
The deﬂection of the incident particle A depends
on its impact parameter b. This is the smallest distance
of A to the target particle B, if there is no deﬂection,
i.e., if A passes along a straight line (Fig. 2.94a). For the
potential scattering (i.e., the description of the scatter-
ing process in the center of mass frame) the particle B
is ﬁxed at the origin of our coordinate frame and it can
be regarded as a point-like particle with inﬁnite mass.
When the initial velocity of particle A is |v(−∞)|=
v0, energy conservation demands

In a real experiment the path (r(t), ϕ(t)) of a single
particle cannot be followed. However, the measured
deﬂection angle ϑ allows to determine the asymptotic
values of the path for r →∞. Since for a spheri-
cally symmetric potential this path must be mirror-
symmetric to the line OS through the point S of closest
approach in Fig. 2.94b. (This means that the scatter-
ing process is invariant against time-reversal.) We can
relate the asymptotic scattering angle ϑ to the polar
angle ϕmin = ϕ(rmin) by
ϑ = π −2ϕmin .

dition ˙r(rmin) = 0. This gives with (2.139) and (2.141)

(2.143)
Note:
•
For r = rmin the integrand in (2.140) becomes in-
ﬁnite. Whether the integral remains ﬁnite depends
on the exponent n in the power dependence of the
interaction potential (Epot(rn)).
•
For b = 0 is L = 0 ⇒ϑ = π. Particles with b = 0
suffer central collisions with B. They are reﬂected
back into the incident direction.
•
If ϑmin is the smallest still detectable deﬂection an-
gle then all particles with ϑ < ϑmin are regarded
as not scattered. These are all particles with b >
bmax(ϑmin). The integral scattering cross section is
then σint = πb2
max. This shows that with such a def-
inition the cross section, which should be solely
dependent on the particle characteristics, becomes
dependent on the design of the apparatus. This con-
tradiction is removed by the quantum-mechanical
treatment of collisions.
•
For monotonic potentials Epot(r) (for example pure
repulsive potentials Epot ∝r−1) there is, for a giv-
en energy E0, a well-deﬁned unique deﬂection
angle ϑ for each value b of the impact parame-
ter (Fig. 2.95a). This is no longer true for non-
monotonic potentials (Fig. 2.95b), where, for ex-
ample, two different impact parameters b1 and b2
may lead to the same deﬂection angle ϑ. Plotting
the curves ϑ(b) at a given initial energy E0 yields
deﬂection curves such as those shown in Fig. 2.95.
Their form depends on E0 and Epot(r).
We should keep in mind that the only quantity ob-
tained from a scattering experiment is the differential
or integral scattering cross section. The impact param-
eter b itself cannot be directly measured! The measured
scattering cross section yields, however, the wanted in-
formation on the deﬂection curve ϑ(b) from which the
interaction potential can be derived. This can be seen
as follows.

Let us assume a parallel beam of incident par-

˙NA = nAvA that
passes through a layer of particles B in rest with densi-
ty nB. All particles A passing through an annular ring
with radius b and width db around an atom B are de-

this annular ring d ˙NA = ˙NA dA = nAvA2πb db par-

2.8.3 Determination of the Charge Distribution
within the Atom from Scattering
Experiments
In order to ﬁnd the charge distribution in atoms the
best choice is to use charged incident particles A
with charge q1 as probes. The charge q2 = ρel dV of
atoms B inside the volume element dV contributes
a force
dFc(r) =
1
4πε0
q1q2
r2 ˆr .
(2.150)
The total force that is responsible for the deﬂection of
the charged particles A is obtained by integration of all
volume elements of atom B.
At the beginning of the 20th century charged pro-
jectiles were available in the form of α particles from
the radioactive decay of some radioactive substances

with charge q1 = +2e, mass m = mHe = 4 AMU and
kinetic energies Ekin = 1–9 MeV. Also, electrons with
lower energies Ekin < 10 keV could be produced from
cathode rays in gas discharges.
When the heavy α particles pass through an atom,
the light electrons of this atom, because of their small
mass, contribute little to the deﬂection of the α particles
which is mainly caused by the positive charges with
larger masses. The measured angular distribution N(ϑ)
of the scattered α particles therefore mainly gives in-
formation about the spatial distribution of the positive
charges while the presence of the atomic electrons only
gives a small correction.
2.8.4 Thomson’s Atomic Model
The results of his experiments and those of others
brought Thomson to the conclusion that each neutral
atom consists of Z electrons with the total charge
q−= −Ze and constituents with a total positive charge
q+ = +Ze. Since the atom is neutral, Thomson pro-
posed for the spatial distribution of the charges his
“raisin cake model,” where all charges were equally
distributed over the volume of the atom with radius R
because this would result in a distribution of minimum
energy, if only electric forces were present (Fig. 2.98).
How can this model be tested experimentally?
The electric ﬁeld of a homogeneously charged
sphere with radius R and charge Ze at a distance r ≤R
from the center is given as

Fig. 2.98. Thomson’s “raisin
cake” model for the distribu-
tion of positive and negative
charges in the atom
with ˆr = ⃗r/|⃗r|, because the charge inside the radius r
is Q = Z · e · r3/R3. If we ﬁrst neglect the negative
charges, an electron would experience the force
F = −eE = −kr
with
k =
Ze2
4πε0R3 .
(2.152a)
Any radial displacement of an electron from its equilib-
rium position would then lead to a harmonic oscillation
(since the restoring force is linearly dependent on the
displacement) with a frequency
ω =
$
k/m .
(2.152b)
If we now consider the other Z −1 electrons, we as-
sume, according to the raisin cake model, a uniform
density
ne =
Z
4
3π R3
(2.152c)
of the electrons that equals the density of the pos-
itive charges. This cloud of electrons can oscillate
against the cloud of positive charges with the so-called
“plasma-frequency,” which can be derived as
ωp =

3Ze2
4πε0meR3 ,
(2.152d)
which differs from the simple model of a single elec-
tron (2.152b) only by a factor of
√
3. When illuminat-
ing these atoms with light the atoms would preferential-
ly absorb at their resonance frequency ωp and its higher
harmonics ωn = nωp.
Atoms excited by light or electron impact should
emit light preferentially at these frequencies.
However, the observed frequencies of light ab-
sorbed or emitted by atoms do not at all agree with
those estimated by Thomson’s model.
The strongest argument against the raisin cake mod-
el is supported by scattering experiments, ﬁrst per-
formed by Sir E. Rutherford and his coworkers, using α
particles emitted by radioactive atoms. These experi-
ments give a different angular distribution of scattered
charged particles than expected from Thomson’s mod-
el. This will now be outlined in more detail.
In Fig. 2.99 we consider the deﬂection of an α par-
ticle with charge q = +2e and mass mα ≈7350 me
by a spherical homogeneous distribution of the posi-
tive charge Q = +Ze. Because of their small mass me

Fig. 2.99. Scattering of a particle with charge q by a homo-
geneous spherical charge distribution with total charge Q
the electrons of the atom do not signiﬁcantly contribute
to the deﬂection of heavy α particles. They are nev-
ertheless important because they bring about that the
total atom is neutral for distances b > R. A charged
particle passing the atom with radius R at an impact
parameter b > R is therefore not deﬂected by much.
In order to measure the charge distribution inside the
atom we therefore need to include only impact param-
eters b ≤R. The following estimation gives an upper
limit for the maximum possible deﬂection angle ϑmax
for a homogeneous distribution of the positive charges.
The existence of the negatively charged light electrons
will decrease this angle only slightly.
A projectile particle with momentum mv0 in the
x-direction is deﬂected by the angle ϑ while passing
through the atom. The deviation is due to the repulsive
fore component
Fy = F(r) cos β ,
(2.153a)
which acts at any point of the path within the atom and
causes a change
Δpy =

Fy dt
(2.153b)
of the momentum (Fig. 2.99). The force F = q E at
a distance r from the center is determined by the elec-
tric ﬁeld E (2.151). We will later see that the deﬂection
is very small. We can therefore neglect the curvature
of the path and approximate the path by a slightly
inclined straight line with a length d = 2

and cos β ≈b/r. With this approximation, we obtain

For typical radii R ≈0.2 nm of gold atoms the

according to Thomson’s model (2.157) with mv2

10 MeV = 1.9 × 10−12 Nm
⇒ϑ = 7.6 × 10−5 rad ˆ= 4.6 × 10−3◦= 0.27′ .
(2.158)

2.8. The Structure of Atoms
73
This is an extremely small deﬂection angle, which is
not easy to measure. However, until now we have on-
ly considered the deﬂection of α particles by a single
atom.
In the experiment performed by Rutherford and his
coworkers Geiger and Marsden, the α particles pass
through a thin gold foil and are therefore scattered by
many gold atoms. For an atomic diameter of 0.4 nm
and a 20-μm thick foil, the α particles have to pass
through 5 × 104 atomic layers. The impact parame-
ters bi, related to the centers of the different atoms are
more or less statistically distributed (see Fig. 2.100a).
Therefore, the average deﬂection angles ϑ caused by
the different atoms, will also be statistically distributed.
The statistical average

of the total deﬂection angle
after n scattering events is (see books on probability
theory)

= √n · ϑ .
The situation is completely analogous to the random
walk problem (see Feynman, vol. I) where a drunken
sailor throws a coin and goes for every step forward
one step to the left or to the right according to whether
the coin shows its foreside or its backside. The prob-
ability P that the sailor deviates after n steps by
a distance Δy from the straight line y = 0 is given by
the Gaussian distribution
P(y) = Ce−(y2/nΔy2) .
By a similar consideration, one obtains
N(ϑ) = N0e−ϑ2/(nϑ2) .

mum at ϑ = 0 has a full halfwidth of (Δϑ)1/2 = 3.4 ×

This is in sharp contrast to the experimental results
discussed in the next section.
2.8.5 The Rutherford Atomic Model
In order to test Thomson’s model, Geiger and Marsden
performed extensive scattering measurements [2.62]
with the experimental setup illustrated in Fig. 2.101.
The α particles were emitted by radon gas in the
tube T, and were collimated by the narrow channel D.

2. The Concept of the Atom
produced faint light ﬂashes on a phosphorous screen S,
which were observed through a microscope. The de-
tector (screen and microscope) could be turned against
the direction of the incident beam. This allowed the de-
tection of α particles scattered by an arbitrary angle ϑ
into a deﬂection range ϑ ± 1/2Δϑ, where Δϑ is the
angular resolution of the detector.
The experiments clearly showed that even particles
with large deﬂection angles up to ϑ = 150◦(limited
by the experimental set-up) could also be observed, in
sharp contrast to Thomson’s atomic model. Rutherford,
who was very much surprised by these unexpected
results said, “This is as improbable as a bullet be-
ing reﬂected back when shooting it into a cotton-wool
ball.” [2.62].
After many discussions, long thoughts and the ex-
amination of several models proposed in the literature,
Rutherford recognized that the positive charge must be
contained in a very small volume around the center
of the atom. This volume, which should carry near-
ly the total mass of the atom, although it covers only
a tiny fraction of the atomic value, was given the name
“atomic nucleus” by Rutherford.
According to this model the α particles are de-
ﬂected only by the nucleus because the masses of
the electrons are small compared with that of the α
particles (me/mα ≈1.4 × 10−4).
Based on these considerations Rutherford derived
his famous scattering formula, which shows excellent
agreement with experimental ﬁndings.
2.8.6 Rutherford’s Scattering Formula
When the α particles, according to Rutherford’s model,
are essentially deﬂected solely by the atomic nucle-
us, which may be regarded as a point-like particle,
the theoretical treatment of the scattering is reduced in
the center-of-mass frame to the scattering of a parti-
cle with reduced mass μ = mαmN/(mα + mN) ≈mα
in a Coulomb potential (see Sect. 2.8.1). Following
the argument in Sect. 2.8.1, we obtain for the angular
momentum L = |L| from (2.136)
L = μr2 ˙ϕ = μv0b
(2.160)
and for the component Fy of the Coulomb-force, re-
sponsible for the deﬂection of the α particles,
Fy = μdvy
dt = a sin ϕ

with
a = qQ

;
q = 2e ,
Q = Ze . (2.161)
This gives
dvy
dt = a sin ϕ

(2.162a)
The α particle comes from the point A (r = −∞)
in Fig. 2.102 and ﬁnally reaches, after the scattering
event, the point B (r = +∞). The angle ϕ changes
during this scattering for a particle with scattering an-
gle ϑ from ϕ = 0 to ϕ = ϕmax = π −ϑ. Integration
of (2.162a) gives
v0 sin ϑ

The solution of the integrals on both sides of (2.162b)
is
v0 sin ϑ =

μv0b(1 + cos ϑ) .
(2.162c)
Because (1 + cos ϑ)/ sin ϑ = cotan (ϑ/2), the relation
between the deﬂection angle ϑ and impact parameter b
of a particle in a potential with potential energy Epot =
a/r becomes
cotan (ϑ/2) = μv2

The ratio a/b represents the potential energy at the
distance r = b. Inserting this into (2.163a) gives:

(2.163b)
The scattering angle ϑ in the CM-system is for
a Coulomb potential determined by the ratio
μv2
0/(a/b) = 2Ekin(r = −∞)/Epot(b)
of twice the initial kinetic energy to the potential
energy at the distance r = b.
EXAMPLE
b=2 × 10−12 m (≈1/100 atomic diameter), μv2
0 =
10 MeV = 1.6 × 10−12 J;
q = 3.2 × 10−19 C,
Q =
1.26 × 10−17 C, μ = 3.92 AMU ⇒ϑ =1.3◦. For b =
2 × 10−13 m (1/1000 atomic diameter) ⇒ϑ = 13.2◦,
and for b = 2 × 10−14 m ⇒ϑ = 51◦.
This example illustrates that for ϑ > 1◦the scatter-
ing cross section σ = πb2 = 10−4 π R2
A becomes very
small compared to the atomic cross section π R2
A. This
illustrates that in spite of the large number of gold
atoms in the foil each α particle is scattered by ϑ > 1◦
once at most when passing through the foil.
In order to obtain the differential scattering cross
section, we have to calculate that fraction of all in-
cident α particles which is scattered into the angular
range ϑ ± 1
2Δϑ and can reach the detector with area
(Fig. 2.103)

product Δ ˙N · sin4 ϑ/2 in Table 2.5 is fairly constant for
ϑ ≥45◦. The slightly larger values for small angles ϑ
are due to the fact, that here Δϑ is no longer very small

The experiments showed that for large angles ϑ >
ϑc which correspond to small impact parameters de-
viations from the expected values were observed
(Fig. 2.105). Rutherford had already recognized that
these deviations are due to the ﬁnite size RN of the
nucleus. If the impact parameter b becomes smaller
than RN, the α particle penetrates into the nucleus. For
b < RN the deﬂection should be described by (2.157).
However, for b < RN a new short range force, called
the nuclear force, becomes important and the Coulomb
law (2.150) is no longer valid. The attractive nucle-
ar force is much stronger than the repulsive Coulomb
force and changes the deﬂection of the α particles.

gies, all scattered by ϑ = 60◦. (b) Deviation from Coulomb
potential for paths with Ekin > 25 MeV (i.e., b < bc) for

Summary
77
Thus the impact parameter at which the mea-
sured distribution deviates from the predicted one gives
a measure for the size of the atomic nucleus. One
obtains values of
RN ≈r0A1/2 ,
where A is the atomic mass in AMU and r0 = 1.3 ×
10−15 m.
The volume of the nucleus therefore only
accounts for the fraction (RN/RA)3 ≈10−13–
10−15 of the atomic volume VA!
While the atomic volume of the gold atom is
about VA = 10−29 m3 that of its nucleus is only VN ≈
10−42 m3.

The initially diffuse and sometimes incorrect pic-
ture of atoms has been concretized by more
and more reﬁned experiments during the past
200 years. This has lead to a quantitative
atomic model that describes most observations
correctly.
•
In a ﬁrst crude model atoms are described by
spherical charge and mass distributions with mean
radii of 0.05–0.5 nm, which can be determined by
scattering experiments or by X-ray diffraction in
crystals.
•
1 mol is that quantity of matter that contains as
many atoms or molecules as 0.012 kg 12C, or that
contains as many grams as the mass number of
its atoms or molecules (in atomic units AMU)
indicates.
•
The Avogadro constant NA = 6.022 × 1023 /mol
gives the number of atoms or molecules in 1 mol
of the substance.
•
Each neutral atom consists of
Z

with
mass
me = (1/1836) AMU
and
charge
−e = −1.6 × 10−19 C and a much more massive
nucleus with mass A (in AMU) and charge +Ze.
•
Free electrons can be produced by thermal
emission from metal surfaces, by ﬁeld emis-
sions from sharp metal peaks in high electric
ﬁelds, by electron impact on atoms or molecules
and by photoionization, following light ab-
sorption by atoms or molecules, and ﬁnally
by the photoeffect, where light incident on
metal surfaces can result in the emission of
electrons.
•
Neutral atoms can be ionized through electron
impact, photon absorption, by collisions with fast
ions or by charge exchange in collisions with other
atoms. Atoms that have lost n electrons are called
n-fold ionized.
•
Negative ions can be formed by recombination
of free electrons with neutral atoms. They have
a surplus of electrons and can be readily ionized
to become neutral atoms again.
•
Charged particles can be deﬂected in electric or
magnetic ﬁelds. Specially formed ﬁelds can act as
electron- or ion-optics. The total length of elec-
trostatic or magnetic lenses can be continuously
varied with the ﬁeld strength.
•
The ratio q/m of charge q to mass m of electrons
and ions can be measured with instruments based
on the deﬂection of charged particles in electric
or magnetic ﬁelds. The mass can be determined
separately only if the charge q is known. Mass
spectrometers are devices that separate ions of
different masses and can measure the absolute
values of masses after calibration with carbon
atoms representing the mass unit.
•
In time-of-ﬂight spectrometers the mass depen-
dent ﬂight time through a ﬁeld-free region of ions
accelerated by a known voltage U is used for
mass determination.

•
Scattering of α particles (He++) by gold atoms,
or more recent modern variants of Rutherford’s
initial experiments, using high energy electrons
or protons, support the Rutherford atomic model,
which proposes the following structure of atoms:
By far, the major part of the atomic mass is united
in a very small volume, called the atomic nucleus
with a typical radius of (1–5) × 10−15 m, which
is about ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than

78
2. The Concept of the Atom
the atomic radius RA ≈10−10 m. The volume of
the nucleus is therefore only about 10−13–10−15 of
the atomic volume. The rest of the volume contains
the Z electrons, but is nearly completely empty of
mass although ﬁlled with the electric ﬁeld of the
charges.
•
The positive charge +Ze of the atomic nucleus is
compensated by the negative charges −Ze of the
Z electrons to form a neutral atom. Experiments
show that possible differences Δq between the ab-
solute values of positive and negative charges are
smaller than Δq/q ≤10−21.

3. Development of Quantum Physics
At the beginning of the 20th century several experi-
mental ﬁndings could not be explained by the existing
theories of the time, which we will name “classical
physics”. These experiments indicated that the concep-
tion of classical physics had to be modiﬁed. Examples
are the measured spectral distribution of radiation from
black bodies, which was in disagreement with theoreti-
cal predictions, the photo effect, the explanation of the
Compton effect and a satisfactory answer to the ques-
tion of why atoms in their lowest energetic state are
stable.
It turned out that the particle model of classical me-
chanics had to be reviewed. This model attributed to
each particle a well-deﬁned path in space that could be
predicted for all times provided the initial conditions
(location and velocity at time t = 0) and the force ﬁeld
acting on the particle, were known.
Also the classical description of electromagnet-
ic ﬁelds and waves by the Maxwellian equations
seemed to need a critical revision when applied to the
microscale of atoms and molecules.
This chapter will present the most important experi-
mental proofs for the necessary modiﬁcation and exten-
sion of classical physics, which have led to the develop-
ment of quantum physics. The basic ideas of quantum
physics will be presented here, while a brief descrip-
tion of the mathematical framework of quantum theory
along with some examples are given in the next chapter.
3.1 Experimental Hints
to the Particle Character
of Electromagnetic Radiation
During the 18th century a long-lasting quarrel was
fought among scientists about the correct description
of light. Newton and his school postulated that light
should consist of small particles [3.1]. Their model
could explain the straight paths of light rays and also
the refraction of light at the boundary between two me-
dia with different refractive indices. Huygens and other
scientists, on the other side, believed that light was
a wave phenomenon. Their experiments on diffraction
and interference seemed to prove their theory [3.2].
The wave model was generally accepted when
Heinrich Hertz discovered the electromagnetic waves
and when it was recognized that visible light was just
a special case of electromagnetic waves restricted to
the wavelength region between λ = 0.4 μm–0.7 μm,
which could be described by the Maxwellian equations
like all electromagnetic waves.
The following sections shall illustrate that both
models, the particle model and the wave description
of light, were partly correct but that both models must
be combined for a complete characterization of light.
The important point, shown by the quantum physical
model is that particle and wave descriptions do not con-
tradict but rather supplement each other. Depending on
which property of light is described, the wave model or
the particle model is a more proper description. Let us
ﬁrst summarize the classical model of electromagnetic
waves.
In classical physics a plane electromagnetic wave
E = A cos(k · r −ωt)
is described by its amplitude A = |A|ˆep, its frequen-
cy ω, and its wave vector k, which points into the
propagation direction and has the amount |k| = 2π/λ,
determined by the wavelength λ = c/ν = 2πc/ω. In
case of a polarized wave the direction of the electric
ﬁeld vector is given by the polarization unit vector ˆep.

vacuum

(3.1)
is determined by its electric ﬁeld amplitude E = |E|
and can be also described by the magnetic ﬁeld ampli-
tude B.
The intensity (the incident power per unit area) of
an electromagnetic wave is
I = cε0E2 = cwem
(3.2a)
and the power, transmitted through the area A with the
normal unit vector ˆen
dW
dt = I A k
|k| ˆen
(3.2b)
is determined by the relative orientation of wave vec-
tor k and normal vector en of the area A.
Note that in this classical description both power
density and intensity depend on the square of the elec-
tric ﬁeld amplitude E. They are continuous functions
of E and of the space coordinates inside the radiation
ﬁeld.
The classical electromagnetic wave also has a mo-
mentum density (momentum per unit volume),
πem = ε0(E × B) = 1
c2 S
(3.2c)
described by the pointing vector S = ε0c2(E × B),
where the amount of S
|S| = ε0cE2 = I
(3.2d)
equals the intensity of the wave.
An important quantity is the spectral intensity Iν
[W m−2 s] with
I =
∞

ν=0
Iν(ν)dν ,
(3.2e)
where Iν(ν)dν gives the incident power density within
the spectral interval dν.
All these results can be derived from Maxwell’s
equations and the continuity equation, which describes
all phenomena observed until the end of the 19th
century very well.
The ﬁrst hints that corrections were necessary came
from experiments measuring the spectral distribution of
the radiation emitted by a hot blackbody, which will be
discussed in the following section.
3.1.1 Blackbody Radiation
Material that absorbs all incident radiation (its ab-
sorption is A∗= 1) is called a blackbody. It can be
approximately realized by a closed cavity with absorb-
ing walls and a small hole in one of the walls (Fig. 3.1).
If the area ΔA of this hole is very small compared to
the area A of the inner walls, radiation passing from
outside through the hole into the cavity has a negligible
chance to leave the cavity again, i.e., it is completely
absorbed. This means that the absorption of the hole is
A∗≈1.
When the walls of the cavity are heated to a tem-
perature T > Ts, where Ts is the temperature of the
surrounding, the hole acts as radiation source with an
intensity that is larger than that of any other body at the
same temperature. This can be demonstrated by a sim-
ple experiment. Into one side of a solid graphite cube
the letter H is mill-cut (Fig. 3.2). At low temperatures
the letter appears much darker than its surroundings,
but at higher temperatures (about 1000 K) it appears

bright yellow on a dark red surrounding. This means
that at low temperatures it absorbs nearly all incident
radiation while at higher temperatures it emits more
than the surface of the cube at the same temperature.
Inside the closed cavity of Fig. 3.1 a stationary radi-
ation ﬁeld exists that depends solely on the temperature
of the cavity walls and not on the dimensions d of the
cavity as long as d ≫λ, where λ is the wavelength of
the enclosed radiation. The application of basic laws of
thermodynamics lead to the following considerations.
•
For a stationary state of the cavity radiation the ra-
diation power emitted by the walls must equal that
absorbed by them for all frequencies ν of the radia-
tion (otherwise the radiation ﬁeld would change in
time). This means
dWa(ν)
dt
= dWe(ν)
dt
.
(3.3)
For such a stationary state we deﬁne the temper-
ature T of the radiation ﬁeld by the temperature
of the cavity walls. The radiation ﬁeld has the
following characteristics.
•
The cavity radiation ﬁeld is isotropic, which means
that the spectral radiation density S∗
ν (this is the
radiation power per frequency interval dν = 1 s−1
radiated into the solid angle dΩ = 1 Sterad) is inde-
pendent of the direction at every point of the cavity.
If this wasn’t the case, one could insert a black disc
with surface area dA into the radiation ﬁeld and ori-
ent it in such a way that its surface normal would
point into the direction of maximum radiation den-
sity (Fig. 3.3). The disc would then absorb more
energy than it emits and would be heated above the

Fig. 3.3. A body in the cavity is at thermal equilibrium with
the thermal isotropic radiation inside the cavity
temperature T of its surrounding. This, however,
contradicts the second law of thermodynamics.
•
The cavity radiation is homogeneous, i.e., its energy
density is independent of a special point inside the
cavity. Otherwise a similar argument would hold as
in the previous paragraph and a perpetual motion
machine of the second kind could be constructed.
When a body is placed inside the cavity radiation ﬁeld,
its surface element absorbs the power

(3.4a)
from the radiation with spectral radiation power densi-
ty S∗
ν within the frequency interval dν incident on dA
within the solid angle dΩ. The constant A∗
ν is the spec-
tral absorbance of the body. The surface element dA
emits, on the other hand, the power
dWe(ν)
dt
= E∗
ν dA dΩ dν
(3.4b)
into the solid angle dΩ within the frequency inter-
val dν.
For thermal equilibrium conditions both quantities
must be equal. Since the cavity radiation is isotropic
and homogeneous, this must be valid for every di-
rection (θ, ϕ) and for every location inside the cavity.
Therefore we obtain Kirchhoff’s law:
E∗
ν
A∗ν
= S∗
ν(T ) .
(3.5)
For all bodies in thermal equilibrium with the
cavity radiation the ratio of spectral emittance
E∗
ν and absorbance A∗
ν equals the spectral radi-
ation density S∗
ν of the cavity radiation, which
itself depends on the temperature T .
For a black body is A∗
ν ≡1 for all frequencies ν.
We therefore conclude from (3.5):
The spectral emittance E∗
ν of a blackbody equals
the spectral radiation density S∗
ν of the cavity
radiation.
Our next task is now to determine the spectral de-
pendence of S∗
ν, which equals the spectral intensity
distribution E∗
ν(ν) of the blackbody radiation.

3. Development of Quantum Physics
3.1.2 Cavity Modes
Let us assume a radiation ﬁeld inside a cubic box with
side lengths L ≫λ that is in thermal equilibrium with
the walls of the cavity at temperature T . The ﬁeld
can be described as the superposition of waves with
wave vectors k = {kx, ky, kz}. A stationary ﬁeld dis-
tribution, which means a standing wave ﬁeld, can be
only realized if certain boundary conditions are ful-
ﬁlled. These conditions demand that the ﬁeld amplitude
be zero at the walls of the box (Fig. 3.4a,b). This re-
stricts the possible values of the components of the
k-vector to
kx = π

(3.7b)
Every stationary ﬁeld distribution with a speciﬁed triple
(n1, n2, n3) is called a mode of the cavity radiation
ﬁeld.
The question now is how many modes with fre-
quencies ω < ωm can exist, where ωm is a number
determined by the speciﬁc problem.
In a coordinate system in k-vector space with
coordinates (π/L)(n1, n2, n3) each triple of integers
(n1, n2, n3) represents a point in a three-dimensional
lattice with the lattice constant π/L. In this sys-
tem (3.7) describes all possible lattice points within
the positive octand of a sphere with radius ω/c (see
Fig. 3.4c). If this radius is large compared to the lat-
tice constant π/L, (which means L ≫λm) the number
N = (L/π)3 · V of lattice points (n1, n2, n3) with ω ≤
ωm is approximately given by the volume
V = 1

of the octant of the sphere in Fig. 3.4c. This also gives
the number of modes of a stationary radiation ﬁeld.

with independent polarization directions of the electric
ﬁeld vector
E = a1 ˆe1 + a2 ˆe2 ,
ˆe1 · ˆe2 = δ12 ,

EXAMPLE
In the visible range (ν = 6 × 1014 s−1 ˆ=λ = 500 nm),
we obtain from (3.10): n(ν) = 3 × 105 m−3 Hz−1.
Within the frequency interval dν = 109 s−1 (this cor-
responds to the frequency width of a Doppler broad-
ened spectral line (see Sect. 7.3)), there are 3 ×
1014 modes/m3.
The spectral energy density wν(ν) of the cavity
radiation ﬁeld is then
wν(ν)dν = n(ν) ¯wν(T )dν ,
(3.11)
where ¯wν(T ) is the average energy per mode, which
depends on the temperature T .
For the determination of ¯wν(T) Rayleigh and Jeans
used a classical model. They assumed that each mode
of the ﬁeld could be treated like a harmonic oscil-
lator with the mean energy wν(T) = kT (remember
the proof in thermodynamics that the mean energy of
a system with f degrees of freedom is
f
2 kT ). The
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator has potential and
kinetic energies with equal mean values. Therefore its
total mean energy is 2 1
2kT . This yields for the spectral
energy density of the cavity ﬁeld
wν(ν) = dν = 8πν2
c3
kT dν
(3.12)
(the Rayleigh–Jeans radiation law).
Through a small hole in a cavity wall the radiation
density S∗(ν)dν = (c/4π)wνdνdΩ is emitted into the
solid angle dΩ. Using (3.11) this gives
S∗
ν(ν)dν = 2ν2
c2 kT dν .
(3.13)
The experimental check shows, that for small fre-
quencies (in the infrared spectral region) (3.13) agrees
quite well with the experimental results. However, for
larger frequencies (in the ultraviolet region) drastic dis-
crepancies were found. While the Rayleigh–Jeans law
predicts
lim
ν→∞S∗
ν(ν) →∞
the experiments proved that with increasing ν the ra-
diation density S∗
ν(ν) increases at ﬁrst, passes through
a maximum and then decreases again. This discrep-
ancy, which could not be explained at that time, was
called the ultraviolet catastrophe.

3. Development of Quantum Physics
3.1.3 Planck’s Radiation Law
What is wrong with the Rayleigh–Jeans model?
This question was ﬁnally answered by Max Planck,
who in 1904 developed a new theory he called quan-
tum hypothesis [3.3, 4]. It is based on the following
assumptions.
Planck also described the cavity modes of the ra-
diation ﬁeld as oscillators. However, he postulated,
that these oscillators could not increase or decrease
their energies wν by arbitrary small amounts (as this
would be for wν = kT ), but only in integer multiples
of a minimum energy quantum hν. The constant
h = 6.6260755 × 10−34 Js
is named Planck’s constant.
This energy quantum hν with the minimum pos-
sible energy wν > 0 is called a photon. The energy
stored in a mode containing n photons is then
wν = nhν .
At thermal equilibrium the energy distribution wν(T )
of a system is governed by the Boltzmann factor
exp[−w/kT ]. Therefore the probability p(wν) that
a mode contains n photons, i.e., has the energy wν =
nhν, is given by
p(wν) =
e−nhν/(kT )
-∞
n=0 e−nhν/(kT ) ,
(3.14a)
where the denominator represents the partition function
which normalizes the probablity p(wν) in such a way
that

(3.17)
This is identical to the Rayleigh–Jeans formula (3.13),

eral Planck distribution for the long wavelength region
(hν/kT ≪1).
Using the relation λ = c/ν, Planck’s law (3.15) can
also be written in terms of the wavelength λ. Note
that
dλ/dν = −c/ν2 ⇒dλ = −(c/ν2)dν.

of a blackbody within the spectral interval Δλ = 1 nm. The
ordinate for the curve for 3000 K is increased 100-fold
To illustrate, Fig. 3.6 shows the wavelength-
dependent distribution of the spectral radiation den-
sity of a blackbody at four different temperatures
and Fig. 3.7 demonstrates the difference between the
Rayleigh–Jeans and Planck distribution.
EXAMPLE
The sun can be regarded, to a good approximation,
as a blackbody with a surface temperature of 5800 K.
Its spectral radiation density emitted at λ = 500 nm
(ν = 6 × 1014 s−1) into the solid angle dΩ = 1 Sterad
within a wavelength interval dλ = 1 nm (Δν = 1.2 ×
1012 s−1) is, according to (3.16),
S∗
νΔν = 4.5 × 104
W
m2 Sterad .
Integration over all wavelengths gives the total radia-
tion density
S∗= 1 × 107 W/(m2 Sterad) .
Integration over the suns surface yields the total power
P⊙= 4π R2⊙107 W = 3.82 × 1026 W
radiated by the sun into all directions.

a distance r = 1.5 × 1011 m covers a solid angle
ΔΩ = π R2
E
4πr2 =

E/4
(1.5 × 1011)2
= 2.5 × 10−7 Sterad .
It therefore receives from the sun the total radiation
power
dW/dt = P⊙ΔΩ/4π = 7.6 × 1018 W .
About 37% of this irradiation falls into the visible range
between ν1 = 4 × 1014 Hz (λ = 750 nm) and ν2 = 7 ×
1014 Hz (λ = 430 nm).
The intensity I = PE/A received per m2 of the
earth surface at vertical incidence is the solar constant
SC = 1.36 × 103 W/m2 .
About 37% ˆ=500 W/m2 are in the visible range.

3. Development of Quantum Physics
Less than half of this radiation power heats the
surface of the earth. Part of it is reﬂected by the atmo-
sphere and the earth’s surface and part of it is absorbed
in the atmosphere.
3.1.4 Wien’s Law
The maximum of the intensity distribution S∗
ν(ν) (3.16)
is obtained by setting the derivative dS∗
ν/dν = 0. This
is more tedious than looking for d(ln S∗
ν)dν = 0, which,
of course, gives the same frequency νm for the intensity
maximum.
The result is (see Problem 3.3)
νm = 2.82
h kT ⇒νm
T = 5.87 × 1010 s−1 K−1 .
(3.19)
The frequency νm of the maximum intensity therefore
increases linearly with the temperature T , which means
that the ratio νm/T is a constant.
Note:
λm does not equal νm/c, because wλ(λ) is deﬁned for
a spectral interval dλ = 1 nm, while wν(ν) is deﬁned
for dν = 1 s−1. Because of the nonlinear relation dλ =
−(c/ν2)dν the variation of wλ(λ) with decreasing λ
differs from that of wν(ν) with increasing ν.
The product λmT = 2.88 × 10−3 m K is a constant
(see Fig. 3.8). Wien’s law can therefore be written as
λmT = const
or
νm/T = const ,
(3.20)
where the two constants are different.

The constant σ is named the Stefan–Boltzmann con-
stant.
Planck’s law, Wien’s law and the Stefan–
Boltzmann law are all in complete agreement
with experimental ﬁndings. This strongly cor-
roborates Planck’s hypothesis of the quantized
radiation ﬁeld, which postulates that the ener-
gy density wν(ν, T ) is not a continuous function
of T but a discontinuous step function with
smallest steps h · ν. In most cases these steps are
so small that they are not directly noticed. We
will, however, soon discuss experiments where
they can be directly detected.
3.1.6 Photoelectric Effect
When a negatively charged isolated metal plate is
irradiated by ultraviolet light (Fig. 3.9) the electric
charge on the plate decreases, as was found in 1887 by
Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) and later in 1895 through
more detailed experiments by Wilhelm Hallwachs
(1859–1922). This means that electrons must have left
the plate.
This light-induced electron emission can be quanti-
tatively measured with the device shown in Fig. 3.10.
The irradiated plate within an evacuated glass bulb
serves as cathode, which is opposed by a similar plate
with positive voltage that forms the anode of an electric

diode. The photocurrent Iph(U) is measured as a func-
tion of the voltage U between cathode and anode. The
measurements show that Iph(U) starts already at slight-
ly negative voltages U0 (i.e., the anode has a negative
voltage U0 against the cathode), rises with increas-
ing voltage until it reaches a saturation value that
depends on the radiative power incident on the cath-
ode (Fig. 3.10b). When electrons can reach the anode
with a negative bias voltage −U ≥−U0 they must
have been emitted from the cathode with a kinetic
energy
Ekin = me
2 v2 ≥eU .
In 1902 Lennard obtained the following results after
careful measurements:
•
The kinetic energy (m/2)v2 of the photoelectrons
is dependent solely on the wavelength λ of the
incident light, not on its intensity!
•
The number of ejected photoelectrons is propor-
tional to the light intensity.
•
There is no measurable time delay between irradia-
tion and electron ejection.
Einstein was able to explain Lennard’s experimental
results in 1905 using the model of light quanta (pho-
tons). Each absorbed photon transfers its energy hν
completely to an electron inside the metal, which is
bound to the metal by attractive forces and needs a min-
imum energy Wa (work-function) to leave the metal.

90
3. Development of Quantum Physics
The maximum kinetic energy of the photo electron is
then
Emax
kin = hν −Wa .
(3.24)
In the experiment this maximum kinetic energy
Emax
kin = eU0
(3.25)
can be determined from the bias voltage −U0 at which
the photocurrent starts. The relation (3.24) can then be
written as
eU0 = hν −Wa .
(3.26)
Plotting eU0 against the photon energy hν = hc/λ,
gives the straight line shown in Fig. 3.11. From its slope
tan α = eU0/(hν), Planck’s constant h can be deter-
mined. The intersection with the vertical axis hν yields
the work function Wa of the cathode material.
In the classical model of an electromagnetic wave
the radiation power PL = ILA incident onto the area A
of the metal should be equally shared by all NΔV elec-
trons with a number density N within the irradiated
volume V = AΔz (Δz ≈λ is the penetration depth of
the light wave with wavelength λ into the metal).
Each electron would then receive, on average, the
energy
¯w = PLΔt
N Aλ .
(3.27)
Since ¯w has to be larger than the workfunction Wa, we
conclude from (3.27) that the irradiation time must be
at least Δt ≥WaN Aλ/PL.

EXAMPLE
A zinc plate (electron density N = 1023 /cm3, work-
function Wa ≈4 eV) is irradiated at a distance of 1 m
from the light source (Hg arc lamp) that emits (through
a spectral ﬁtter) 1 W radiation power at λ = 250 nm.
The power incident onto 1 cm2 of the zinc plate is then
the intensity
Ic = 1 W
4π R2 = 8 × 10−6 W/cm2 .
This power is shared by NΔV = λ · 1023 = 2.5 ×
1019 electrons. The average radiation power re-
ceived by one electron is Pel = 3 × 10−24 W = 2 ×
10−5 eV/s. This means it would take Δt = Wa/Pel =
2 × 105 s before an electron had accumulated sufﬁ-
cient energy to escape from the metal. This strongly
contradicts the experimental results.
Einstein’s model could explain the experimental re-
sults completely. In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize
in Physics for his photoeffect theory (not for his theory
of relativity!).
There are numerous descriptions of detailed experi-
ments in the literature that unambiguously corroborate
Einstein’s theory of the photo effect [3.5]. One example
is the experiment performed by Joffe and Dobronrawov
in 1925 [3.6]. They measured the changes ΔQ of the
charge Q of a small bismuth particle balanced between
the plates of a capacitor (Fig. 3.12) during illumina-
tion of the particle with low intensity X-rays. Every
change ΔQ, due to the loss of an electron results in
a perturbation of the balance between gravitational and
electric force and leads to a movement of the particle,
which is observed through a microscope.

ing the photon model of Planck

3.1. Experimental Hints to the Particle Character of Electromagnetic Radiation
91
The X-ray source emitted ˙N = 103 X-ray quanta
with hν = 104 eV per second into all directions, which
corresponds to a radiation power of 10−12 W. On the
average a charge change ΔQ of the particle was ob-
served every 30 min. The quantum hypothesis explains
this experimental ﬁnding as follows.
The number of X-ray photons hν, hitting the
bismuth particle within the time interval Δt
is
Z = ˙NΔtΔΩ/4π, where ΔΩ is the solid angle ac-
cepted by the particle. With ΔΩ = 6 × 10−6 Sterad
and Δt = 1800 s the estimated number becomes Z = 1
in accordance with the experiment.
The classical model describes X-rays as a spherical
wave, propagating from a point-like source in all di-
rections. Like in the quantum model, the fraction dP
of the radiation power P absorbed by the particle
is dP = PdΩ/4π. However, the absorbed power dP
should be shared by all N ≈1012 electrons of the bis-
muth particle. In order to emit an electron after 30 min,
all electrons must simultaneously transfer their energy
share to the same electron, which is highly improba-
ble. This example shows that the deﬁciency of the wave
model stems from the fact that it does not concentrate
the wave energy onto a single electron but spreads it out
to a larger volume determined by the irradiated area.
Note:
However, the discrepancy between the wave model of
light and the experimental results can be removed if not
only the radiation but also the electrons are described
as waves (see Sect. 3.2).
3.1.7 Compton Effect
The particle character of light quanta became particu-
larly clear by the results of an experiment performed
in 1922 by Arthur Holly Compton (1892–1962). When
irradiating material by X-rays with wavelength λ0,
Compton found that the scattered radiation did not only
contain the wavelengths λ0 expected for elastic scatter-
ing, but also larger wavelength λs > λ0 (Fig. 3.13). The
intensity distribution I(λs) of this scattered radiation is
strongly dependent on the scattering angle ϕ, but only
slightly on the kind of material used.
The quantum model describes the Compton effect
as an elastic collision between a photon with energy hν
and momentum p = hk and a loosely bound electron
of the scattering material (Fig. 3.13b). If the binding
energy Eb ≪hν is small compared to the photon ener-
gy hν we can neglect it and regard the electron as a free
particle. In order to simplify the following calculation
we further assume that the electron is at rest before the
collision, although this assumption is not essential for
the result.
For the elastic collision
hν0 + e−(Ekin = 0) →hνs + e−"
E
kin > 0
#
(3.28)
total energy and total momentum have to be conserved.
Since the photon travels with the velocity of light and
the ejected electron might also have a large velocity,
we must use the relativistic description. We choose our
coordinate system in such a way that the incident pho-
ton travels into the x direction, and the xy-plane is the
scattering plane (Fig. 3.13c). The energy conservation
then reads with β = v/c as:
hν0 = hνs + Ekin(e−)
with

the X-rays for a scattering angle ϕ = 90◦. Multi-
plying (3.34a) by c yields

(3.34b)
This shows that the ratio of Compton wavelength λc
and incident wavelength λ0 equals the ratio of inci-
dent photon energy hν0 to the rest energy m0c2 of the
electron.
The experimental results are in excellent agreement
with this theoretical result and again corroborate the
particle model of electromagnetic radiation.
From measurements of λ0, λs and ϕ the Compton
wavelength λc and Planck’s constant h can be de-
termined, since the electron mass m0 is known (see
Sect. 2.6).
3.1.8 Properties of Photons
The experiments described in the previous sections
have demonstrated the particle character of electromag-
netic radiation. Each electromagnetic ﬁeld with fre-
quency ν consists of energy quanta hν, called photons.
A ﬁeld with energy density wem contains
n = wem
hν
(3.35)
photons per m3. In an electromagnetic wave with ﬁeld
amplitude E and intensity I = cε0E2
˙N = I
hν = nc
(3.36)
photons pass per second through an illuminated unit
area A = 1 m2, perpendicular to the wave vector k. The
Compton effect shows that the momentum
p = ¯hk
with
| p| = ¯h 2π
λ = hν/c
(3.37)
can be attributed to a photon hν. The total momentum
per unit volume inside a plane electromagnetic wave
with energy density wem is then
πem = n¯hk
and
|πem| = nhν/c = wem/c .
(3.38a)
When a photon is absorbed by an atom (see Sect. 7.3)
the angular momentum of the atom changes by 1¯h =

“atom plus photon” must be conserved, the photon has
to carry the angular momentum ±1¯h, which is also
called the spin of the photon
sphoton = ±¯h k
k
(3.38b)
and is independent of its energy hν. If left circularly-
polarized light (σ +-polarization) propagating in the
z direction is absorbed by atoms, the z component
of their angular momentum Jz is changed by ΔJz =
+¯h, if σ −-light (right circular polarization) is ab-
sorbed Jz changes by ΔJz = −¯h. We therefore must
conclude that σ + light consists of photons with spins
sph = +¯hk/|k| pointing into the propagation direction,
while σ −light represents photons with sph = −¯hk/|k|
(Fig. 3.14).
Note:
In older literature σ + light is called left circularly-
polarized, because the polarization vector rotates coun-
terclockwise for an observer looking against the direc-
tion of light propagation. Similary σ −light was named
“right circular polarized”.
Since linearly polarized light (π-polarization) can
be regarded as a superposition of σ + + σ −compo-
nents, it should consist of equal numbers of photons
with sph = +¯hk/|k| and sph = −¯hk/|k|. Indeed, the
absorption of π-polarized light does not change the
angular momentum component Jz of the atoms.

and total energy E of a particle we can formally

to a photon with energy hν. From the relativistic energy
relation
E =

between energy E and momentum p of a particle with
rest mass m0 it follows for the photon with E = hν and
p = E/c that its rest mass m0 must be zero. This result
can be also obtained from the relativistic relation
m =
m0
$
1 −v2/c2 ⇒m0 = m

1 −v2/c2 .
Since vphoton = c, we obtain for a ﬁnite mass m the
result m0 = 0.
Note:
Photons at rest do not exist! It is therefore some-
how artiﬁcial to speak of the photon rest mass. It
is more logical to use the relation m = h · ν/c2
for the deﬁnition of the photon mass.
3.1.9 Photons in Gravitational Fields
When we attribute the mass m = hν/c2 to a photon,
it must experience a gravitational force. If a photon is
send from a point r1 with gravitation potential φG(r1)
to a point r2 with φG(r2) the potential energy changes
by
ΔEpot = mΔφG = hν
c2 (φG(r1) −φG(r2)) .
(3.40)
Because of energy conservation the photon energy hν
must change by this amount. The frequency ν1 of
a photon is therefore changing to
ν2 = ν1

where M⊙is the mass of the sun, R⊙its radius
and G the gravitational constant. The frequency in-
crease of photons entering the gravitational ﬁeld of
the earth is very small compared to this decrease
and has been neglected. Inserting numerical val-
ues yields Δν/ν = 5 × 10−7. This frequency shift
can be readily measured with modern interferome-
ters [3.8].
3. For M = R · c2/G we obtain ν2 = 0. This repre-
sents a “Black Hole” where no light from locations
R < Rs = M · G/c2 can escape. The radius Rs is
called Schwarzschild Radius.
Light suffers a red shift when propagating away
from an attracting mass. This red shift corre-
sponds to an increase ΔWpot in potential energy
of a particle with mass m = hν/c2. If ΔWpot >
hν0 the light cannot leave the attracting mass.
This situation is found for black holes.

3.1.10 Wave and Particle Aspects of Light
The discussion in the last section has shown that
the particle properties of photons, such as mass m =
hν/c2, energy hν and momentum p = ¯hk; | p| = ¯h/λ
can be only deﬁned by using the wave characteris-
tics frequency ν and wavelength λ = c/v. This itself
illustrates the tight connection between the particle
model and the wave model of electromagnetic ﬁelds.
As an example we will consider the relation between
the intensity I of an electromagnetic wave and the
corresponding photon ﬂux density. When ˙N = dN/dt
photons hν pass per second with velocity c through
a unit area perpendicular to the propagation direction,
the intensity I (energy per m2 per s) is
I = ˙Nhν .
(3.42a)
In the wave model the intensity is
I = ε0cE2 .
(3.42b)
The comparison of (3.42a) and (3.42b) gives the re-
lation between the electric ﬁeld amplitude E of the
electromagnetic wave and the photon ﬂux ˙N
E =
!
˙Nhν
ε0 · c
(3.42c)
which shows that the ﬁeld amplitude is proportional to
the square root of the photon ﬂux ˙N.
The photon structure of light can be demonstrated
by various experiments besides those already discussed
in the previous sections. A famous example is the
experiment by Taylor (Fig. 3.16) where many equal de-
tectors Di are arranged on a circle with radius R around

ted by the source into all directions, is described in
the classical wave model as a spherical wave with ﬁeld
amplitude

(3.43a)
All detectors with sensitive area S at a distance R from
the centrum r = 0 receive, per s, the same radiation
power
dW
dt = cε0

R2 S .
(3.43b)
This is indeed observed for sufﬁciently large light
intensities.
If, however, the emitted power of the light source
is diminished so much that dW/dt ≪hν/τ, where τ is
the time interval that can just be resolved by the detec-
tors then at most one photon can reach a detector per
resolved time interval. Not all detectors give simulta-
neous signals but only one or none of them during the
time τ. The output signals of the detectors Di are statis-
tically distributed in time. Averaged over a time interval
Δt ≫τ all detectors again show the same total number
of counts.
This means that in this experiment the quantum
structure of light becomes apparent at low light inten-
sities. The radiation energy of the source is in this case
not simultaneously emitted into all directions, but at
one time a photon ﬂies only in one direction and at
another time into another direction.
The total number of photons received by each
detector over a time interval Δt shows a Poisson
distribution
N = ¯Ne−(N−¯N)/ ¯N
(3.44)
with a standard deviation σ =
√¯N. The probability P
that any one of the detectors has counted N = ¯N ±
3
√¯N photons is P = 0.997.
This illustrates that the classical wave description
of light represents the asymptotic case of large photon
ﬂuxes. The relative ﬂuctuations of the photon ﬂux

decreases with increasing photon ﬂux ˙N and the quan-
tum structure of electromagnetic waves (i.e., the steps

3. Development of Quantum Physics
hν in the energy density) becomes signiﬁcant only for
small photon ﬂux densities ˙N.
An essential characteristic of a classical particle is
its localization within a small spatial volume, which is
the volume of the particle, in contrast to a wave that
is spread out over a larger volume. How this apparent
contradiction of particle and wave description can be
solved will be discussed in Sect. 3.3.
The question of whether light can be regarded as
a wave or a stream of particles was controversially
and vehemently discussed for a long time between
Isaac Newton (1642–1727), who represented the par-
ticle model, and Christian Huygens (1629–1695) who
believed in the wave model [3.2]. Both scientists met in
London in 1689 and discussed their controversial views
but could not come to an agreement.
Experiments by Huygens, Thomas Young (1773–
1829), and many other researchers, looking at diffrac-
tion and interference of light decided the quarrel in
favor of the wave model, since at that time it was
generally accepted that particles will not show any in-
terference effects. It is very instructive to discuss the
diffraction and the interference of light by a double
slit (Young’s double slit) experiments (Fig. 3.17). The

detector can be a photoplate in the observation plane
or, in a modern version, a two-dimensional CCD ar-
ray, where one can decide which diode of the array has
received a photon. The experiment shows that at sufﬁ-
ciently low intensities one ﬁrst sees a statistical spatial
distribution of photons without recognizable interfer-
ence fringes (Fig. 3.17a). Increasing the illumination
time at a constant source intensity, the interference pat-
tern emerges more and more clearly (Fig. 3.17b). As
long as the difference Nmax −Nmin of the photon num-
bers in the maxima and minima of the interference
pattern is less than
√¯N, the pattern can hardly be seen.
However, if by accumulation over a time interval Δt the
number ˙NΔt becomes sufﬁciently large, interference
clearly appears, even if the intensity is so small that on-
ly one photon passes the slits at a time. From a classical
point of view this cannot be understood. How should
a photon know through which of the two slits the fore-
going photon passed? This apparent paradox has been
solved by the quantum theory, which will be discussed
in Chap. 4.
The above examples show that according to our
present concepts, light has wave as well as par-
ticle character. The important point is that both
models do not contradict but supplement each
other, as will become clearer in the next sections.
At the end of this section Table 3.1 compiles both
the wave and particle descriptions of light.

3.2 Wave Properties of Particles
We will now show that objects that had always been
regarded unambiguously as particles, such as elec-
trons, nuclei, atoms or molecules also show wave
properties, since diffraction and interference phenom-
ena have been meanwhile observed for these particles
(Fig. 3.18).
Louis de Broglie (1892–1987) (Fig. 3.19) was the
ﬁrst to propose (in 1924) a wave description of both
light and particles, although at this early time, no wave
properties of particles had been observed experimental-
ly [3.9].
For this idea, which he later outlined in more detail,
de Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929.
3.2.1 De Broglie Wavelength
and Electron Diffraction
If the relation p = ¯hk found for photons is also applied
to particles with mass m, moving with the veloci-
ty v, we can attribute to them a wavelength λ = 2π/k,
which can be written with k = p/¯h and p = m · v as
λ = h
p = h
mv =
h
√2mEkin
.
(3.46)
The de Broglie wavelength is inversely propor-
tional to the momentum of a particle.
When electrons are accelerated by a voltage U
reaching the velocity v ≪c, we obtain with Ekin = eU
the de Broglie wavelength
λ =
h
√
2meU
.

Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881–1938) (Nobel Prize
1937) and Lester Halbat Germer (1896–1971) could
indeed demonstrate in 1926, two years after de
Broglie’s proposal, that electrons with the kinetic ener-
gy Ekin = e · U in a collimated beam from an electron
gun at the voltage −U produced interference patterns,
when they were reﬂected by a single crystal of nick-
el (Fig. 3.20). There are two ways to detect these
interferences:
a) When the electrons, accelerated by a constant
voltage U, are reﬂected by the Nickel-crystal,
a diffraction pattern I(ϕ) is measured, when the
detector has a variable direction ϕ against the
incident beam.
b) At ﬁxed angles ϕ and ϑ the voltage U is varied
and thus the de-Broglie wavelength (Fig. 3.20b).
Maxima of the reﬂected intensity are observed
for the Bragg-condition (see Sect. 2.2.3) m · λ =
2d · sin ϑ; m = 1, 2, 3, . . ., where d is the distance

the maxima appear at voltages U with

(3.47b)
With high energy electrons, transmitted through
a thin foil of crystaline aluminium, circular diffraction
patterns can be detected on a photoplate behind the foil
which were quite similar to those patterns produced
by X-rays (Fig. 3.18b), which had already been recog-
nized as short wavelength electromagnetic waves (see
Chap. 7).
This proved that electrons, which had always been
clearly regarded as particles, also show wave proper-
ties in this experiment, in accordance with de Broglie’s
hypothesis (3.41). In Fig. 3.21 the diffraction patterns
of light and of electrons produced by the sharp edge of
a MgO crystal are compared. It illustrates that the same
Fig. 3.21a,b. Comparison of (a) light diffraction and (b) elec-
tron diffraction with Ekin = 38 keV at the edge of a MgO
single crystal. For (b) the distance r0 of the photoplate from
the edge was chosen such that the product r0λ was equal
for (a) and (b) (From: H. Raether: Elektroneninterferenzen
in: Handbuch der Physik Bd. 32, 443 (1957))
Fresnel diffraction pattern is produced in both cases
if the product λr0 of wavelength λ, and distance r0
between the edge and the photoplate is the same.
3.2.2 Diffraction and Interference of Atoms
More recent experiments have shown that particle
diffraction and interference is not restricted to electrons
but can also be observed for atoms [3.10]. In Fig. 3.22,
helium atoms in an atomic beam pass in the x direc-
tion through a narrow slit of width b = 12 μm. The
atomic waves diffracted by S0 then reach two slits S1
and S2, with b = 1 μm each, separated by 8 μm, which
are located 64 cm downstream of S0.
In the observation plane x = x0 an interference
pattern I(y) is produced that can be monitored with
a detector, movable in the y direction. The observed

interference pattern looks like that of light in Young’s
double slit experiment.
Note:
He atoms in their ground state cannot be detected very
efﬁciently. Therefore energetically excited He atoms
He∗are used, which are in a “metastable state” (see
Sect. 6.1) with a lifetime longer than the transit time
from the He∗source to the detector. These excited He∗
atoms release electrons when impinging on a metal
plate. The resulting ions can be effectively monitored.
In a second experiment, shown in Fig. 3.23, a col-
limated beam of metastable He atoms passes through
a standing light wave with optical wavelength λL,

served when a beam of metastable He atoms passes through
a standing light wave. (a) Experimental setup (b) Observed
interference pattern N(θ) in the plane x = const, y =
L sin θ [3.10]
produced by two laser beams traveling in opposite ±y
directions. In the nodes of the standing wave the light
amplitude is zero and the atoms can pass undeﬂected.
In the maxima, the light intensity is high and the atoms
can absorb photons if the laser frequency is tuned to
an absorbing transition of the atoms. These photons
transfer their momentum ¯hk in the ±y direction to
the atoms, resulting in a deﬂection of atoms out of
the x direction. With a detector behind the light wave
the atomic interference pattern shown in Fig. 3.23b is
observed, where the number N(Θ) of He∗atoms is
measured when the detector is moved along the ±y
direction [3.10]. The result can be explained by two
different models, which do not contradict each other.
In the wave model the standing light wave acts onto
the atoms like a phase grating, quite analogous to phase
gratings used in optics, because the periodic variation
of the electric ﬁeld E(y) of the standing light wave acts
on the atoms like a periodic variation of the index of
refraction. The reason for this is that the potential ener-
gy of the atoms depends on the electric ﬁeld amplitude
and since the total energy of the atoms is constant,
their kinetic energy changes accordingly. Diffraction
of the atomic de Broglie wave by this phase grating
with a grating constant d = λL/2 results in intensity
maxima if the phase difference between neighboring
diffracted partial waves Δϕ = (2π/λdB)Δs, becomes
Δϕ = n2π (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .). With the path difference
Δs = d sin Θ = λL sin Θ we obtain for the nth diffrac-
tion maximum at angle Θn ≪1
nλdB = Δs = λL sin Θn ⇒Θn ≈nλdB
λL
.
(3.48)
The result of Fig. 3.23b can be also explained with the
particle model if photons and atoms are both treated
as particles. The absorption of n photons in the ± di-
rection causes a recoil of the atoms with a transferred
momentum
Δpy = ±n¯hk = ±nh/λL .
(3.49a)
The atoms therefore change their ﬂight direction by
angles Θn, determined by
sin Θn = Δpy

p

λL
,
(3.49b)
which gives the same result as (3.48) and illustrates that
the particle model as well as the wave model correctly
describe the same experimental result [3.11].

3. Development of Quantum Physics
3.2.3 Bragg Reﬂection
and the Neutron Spectrometer
When a collimated beam of particles with momentum
p = mv and de Broglie wavelength λdB = h/p im-
pinges on a crystal under the angle ϑ against parallel
crystal planes, the partial waves reﬂected by the differ-
ent planes with distance d can interfere constructively
if the path difference Δs = 2d sin α becomes an inte-
ger multiple of the wavelength λdB (see Fig. 2.10). This
leads to the Bragg condition:
2d sin ϑ = nλdB
(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) .
(3.49c)
Measuring the different angles ϑn of incidence, where
maxima occur in the reﬂected beam, yields the de
Broglie wavelength λdB, if the distance d between
adjacent crystal planes is known.
This is illustrated in Fig. 3.24 by the example of
a neutron spectrometer [3.12]. The neutrons, produced
inside the core of a nuclear reactor are slowed down by
inelastic collisions with H-atoms in parafﬁn and leave
the reactor through collimating apertures as a collimat-
ed beam with thermal velocity distribution. They are
directed towards a crystal that can be turned around
a vertical axis to choose a wanted angle ϑ1 against
the direction of the incident neutron beam. They have
a velocity
v =
h
2md sin ϑ1
.
(3.49d)
The crystal acts as velocity ﬁlter and reﬂects on-
ly neutrons with the wavelength λdB = 2d sin ϑ1 in-
to the direction ϑ2. It therefore acts like a grating
monochromator in optical spectroscopy. When these
“monochromized neutrons” impinge onto a second
crystal with unknown distance d between its crystal
planes, d can be determined if the crystal is turned
around a vertical axis and the intencity maxima are
counted by a borotriﬂuoride detector.
Instead of using the Bragg reﬂection by a crystal
with known distance d between its planes, a time-of-
ﬂight technique can be used to select neutrons with
a given velocity (Fig. 3.24b). A rotating absorbing
disc with a narrow slit transmits neutrons only dur-
ing the short time interval Δt at time t = 0. At a
distance L from the ﬁrst disc a second disc with a

with known velocities and therefore known de Broglie
wavelength can now be directed towards a Bragg crys-
tal with unknown distances dx of its planes. Measuring
the angles ϑn, where maxima of the reﬂected beam are
observed, yields the wanted distances dx.
3.2.4 Neutron and Atom Interferometry
The wave properties of neutrons allow the construc-
tion of a neutron interferometer, analogous to an X-ray
interferometer (see Sect. 2.2.3). Such a particle in-
terferometer can be used to measure many quantities
important for basic physics and for many applications.
The device is shown in Fig. 3.25 (compare with
Fig. 2.12!). Three thin slices of a silicon crystal are cut
out of a single crystal. This guarantees that the three

slices have the same crystal orientation. The intensi-
ties I1 and I2, measured by the detectors D1 and D2
depend on the phase differences of the interfering par-
tial neutron beams. The sum of the intensities I1 + I2
is, however, independent of phase shifts.
If a phase shifting sample is now brought into one
of the partial beams, the signals of D1 and D2 change.
Due to interactions of the neutrons with the nuclei of
the sample, their potential is altered inside the sample.
This causes a phaseshift of their de Broglie wave.
The phase shift can also be caused by the gravita-
tional ﬁeld of the earth, if the two partial beams pass
at different heights Hi through the interferometer, be-
cause then the potential energy of the neutrons mgHi is
different and therefore their kinetic energy changes by
ΔEkin = −m · g · ΔH .
Because Ekin = h2/
"

#
we obtain
ΔλdB = 2mg · ΔH
Ekin
.
Note:
Phase shifts caused by ΔH = 1 cm can already be
detected [3.14].
With such an interferometer, phase shifts caused by
electric or magnetic ﬁelds or by materials transparent
for neutrons can be measured. They give information
on the interaction of neutrons with the ﬁelds or with
the atoms of the sample.
Also for atoms interferometers
can be real-
ized [3.13]. Replacing the diffracting Bragg crystal
slices by standing optical waves, which deﬂects the
atoms by photon recoil allows the realization of an
atomic interferometer (see Sect. 3.2.3), which can mea-
sure the phase shift of atomic de Broglie waves, when
interacting with external ﬁelds or with matter.
3.2.5 Application of Particle Waves
The de Broglie wavelength λdB = h/(mv) can be
adopted to the special problem by selecting the appro-
priate particle velocity v. For example, the measure-
ment of the distances d between adjacent crystal planes
demands λdB < d. In Table 3.2 some numerical values
of λdB for electrons, neutrons and He atoms at three
different kinetic energies are compiled, in order to give
a feeling of the order of magnitude for λdB.
EXAMPLE
Helium atoms at room temperature (T ≈300 K) have
a mean velocity ¯v ≈1,300 m/s and a mean kinetic en-
ergy Ekin ≈0.03 eV. Their de Broglie wavelength is
then λdB = 8.3 × 10−11 m. This is about half of the
typical atomic distances in a crystal.
With such thermal He atoms, the surface structure
of solids can be probed by measuring the diffraction

pattern of the reﬂected atoms obtained when a paral-
lel beam of He atoms falls under an angle ϑ onto the
surface. Since the atoms, contrary to neutrons, do not
penetrate into the solid, only the surface layer of the
crystal atoms contributes to the diffraction. The diffrac-
tion pattern therefore gives information on the structure
of this surface layer and will change when other atoms
are adsorbed at the surface.
When we regard the electrons in an electron micro-
scope as de Broglie waves, their wavelength at a kinetic
energy of Ekin = 105 eV is λdB ≈4 × 10−12 m, i.e., by
ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength
of visible light. Therefore, the principle lower limit ζx
for the spatial resolution (ζx ≥λ/2) is much small-
er than in a light microscope. However, although the
resolution in a real electron microscope is not limit-
ed by diffraction and reaches a spatial resolution of
Δx < 0.1 nm, it is still limited by imaging errors in the
electron-optics.
3.3 Matter Waves and Wave Functions
In the wave model of a particle with mass m, moving
with a velocity v in the x direction, we write the wave
function quite analogously to that of light waves as
ψ(x, t) = Cei(kx−ωt) = Cei/¯h(px−Et) ,
(3.50a)
where we have used the relations E = Ekin = ¯hω be-
tween the energy E of a free particle (Epot = 0) and the
angular frequency ω of its matter wave, and
p = ¯hk
(3.50b)
between its momentum p and the wave vector k with
|k| = 2π/λdB.
Note, however, that there exists an important dif-
ference between electromagnetic waves and matter
waves. The phase velocity of electromagnetic waves in
vacuum, obtained from the condition
d
dt (kx −ωt) = 0 ⇒vph = dx
dt = ω
k = const
⇒dvph
dω = 0
(3.51)
is independent of ω, since k =2π/λ=ω/c ⇒vph =c.
This means that electromagnetic waves propagat-
ing in a vacuum do not show dispersion.
For matter waves this does not hold! We obtain for
a free particle with E = Ekin = p2/2m
ω = E
¯h = ¯hk2
2m ⇒vph = ω
k = ¯hk
2m =
p
2m
⇒dvph
dω = 1
k ̸= 0 .
(3.52)
The phase velocity depends on the momentum p of the
particle. This can be seen, when we calculate ω(k). We
have to use the relativistic relation
E = (p2c2 + m2c4)1/2 = mc2 + p2/(2m) + . . . ..
between energy E and momentum p. With E = hω we
obtain:
ω(k) = E/¯h = mc2/¯h + ¯hk2/2m + . . . ..
The phase velocity vph = ω/k becomes therefore:
vph = hω/¯hk = mc2/(¯hk) + ¯hk/2m + . . . ..
This shows that the phase velocity does de-
pend on k, which means that matter waves show
dispersion.
The absolute value of vph is
vph = hω/¯hk = E/p.
with E = mc2/(1 −ß2) and p = mvT/(1 −ß2) we ob-
tain
vph = E/p = c2/vT →vph > c!!!
which implies that the phase velocity of matter waves
is larger than the velocity of light.
Question: Why is this not in contradiction to the
theory of special relativity?
Therefore the matter wave (3.52) and its phase ve-
locity vph is not directly useful for the description of the
moving particle. Furthermore, the particle is restrict-
ed to a certain volume dV = dxdydz around a point
(x(t), y(t), z(t)), which moves with the particle veloc-
ity vp in space, while the matter wave (3.50a) extends
over the total space. This deﬁciency can be removed by
introducing the model of wave packets.

3.3. Matter Waves and Wave Functions

3.3.1 Wave Packets
Wave packets represent a superposition of monochro-
matic waves with frequencies ω j in an interval Δω
(Fig. 3.26). The introduction of wave packets (some-
times also called wave groups) localizes the matter
wave within a certain space interval Δx or for three
dimensional problems within the volume dV . This can
be seen as follows.
When many monochromatic plane waves with am-
plitudes C j, frequencies ω j within a restricted inter-
val Δω and parallel wave vectors k within the inter-
val Δk (Fig. 3.27a), propagating in the x direction, are
superimposed, their sum
ψ(x, t) =

shows maximum amplitudes ψ(xm) at locations xm
(Fig. 3.27b), which propagate into the x direction with
the group velocity vg = dω/dk.
With an inﬁnite number of such waves with fre-
quencies ω ﬁlling the interval
ω0 −Δω/2 ≤ω ≤ω0 + Δω/2
and with wave numbers k0 −Δk/2 ≤k ≤k0 + Δk/2

where we neglect the higher order terms. If the am-
plitude C(k) does not change much over the small
interval Δk, we can replace C(k) by its constant val-
ue C(k0). Inserting (3.55) into (3.54) we obtain with
the abbreviations

amplitude A(x, t) that has a maximum for u = 0, cor-

(3.56c)
The maximum of the wave packet propagates with the
group velocity vg = (dω/dk)k0 into the x direction. We
call ψ(x, t) a wave packet (Fig. 3.27b). The form of the
wave packet (maximum amplitude and width Δx, i.e.,
the distance between the ﬁrst side minima of both sides
of the central maximum depends on the chosen inter-
val Δk and the amplitude distribution C(k) in (3.25).
In Figs. 3.27b and 3.28b the wavepackets (3.54) with
constant amplitudes C(k) = C(k0) and with a Gaussian
distribution of C(k) are compared.

it follows that the group velocity of the wave packet
equals the particle velocity vp.

the width Δx of the central maximum between the
two minima
Δx = 4π
Δk ≥2π
k0
= λdB .
This shows that the width Δx of the wave packet
has a minimum value equal to the de Broglie wave-
length λdB.
We summarize:
Particles can be described by wave packets. The
particle velocity equals the group velocity of the
wave packet and the particle can be localized not
better than within its de Broglie wavelength.
Note that this spatial restriction corresponds to the
spatial resolution in optics, when illuminating objects
with light. Here, however, the spatial resolution is
limited by the wavelength λ of the light.
Remark
The additional small side maxima in Fig. 3.27b that
appear when a constant amplitude C(k) = C(k0) is
used, disappear when C(k) is represented by a Gaussian
distribution
C(k) = C(k0) exp

−(k −k0)2/2Δk2 
(see Fig. 3.28).
In spite of this close correspondence between the
wavepacket and its particle, the wave packet ampli-
tude (3.56a) can not be the real representation of the
particle for the following reasons:
•
The wave function ψ(x, t) in (3.56a) can assume
complex and negative values, which do not corre-
spond to real and measurable particle properties
•
The width Δx(t) of the wave packet increases
with time because of the dispersion of the matter
waves of which it is composed (see next section).
It changes its form while propagating in space, in
contrast to a real particle, which keeps its form.
•
Any elementary particle, such as the electron, is
indivisible according to our present knowledge.
A wave, however, can be split, for instance by
a beam splitter, into two components, which then
move into different directions.

These difﬁculties induced Max Born (1882–1970,
Fig. 3.29) to propose a statistical interpretation of the
physical meaning of matter waves [3.15].
3.3.2 The Statistical Interpretation
of Wave Functions
Since a particle incident on a boundary plane between
two media has to be either reﬂected or transmitted, the
splitting of the corresponding matter wave into a re-
ﬂected and transmitted partial wave could be related to
the probability of reﬂection or transmission of the parti-
cle. However, the probability is per deﬁnition a positive
real number between zero and one. Therefore, the com-
plex wave amplitude can not be directly interpreted
as a probability. Max Born proposed the following
deﬁnition.
The probability P(x, t)dx of ﬁnding a particle at
time t in the space interval from x −Δx/2 to x +
Δx/2 is proportional to the absolute square |ψ(x, t)|2
of the wave function ψ(x, t) representing the particle
P(x, t)Δx ∝|ψ(x, t)|2Δx .

|ψ(x, t)|2 is called the probability density at the loca-
tion x at time t (Fig. 3.30a).
A particle moving along the x-axis can be found
with certainty within the interval −∞≤x ≤+∞.
Therefore the condition
+∞

−∞
|ψ(x, t)|2dx = 1
(3.59)
can be used for the normalization of the wave func-
tion. With this normalization the proportionality factor
in (3.58) becomes unity and we obtain
P(x, t)Δx = |ψ(x, t)|2Δx .
(3.60)
To a particle moving freely in three-dimensional space,
a three-dimensional wave packet ψ(x, y, z, t) can be at-
tributed (Fig. 3.30b) and the same arguments as above
result in the normalization



|ψ(x, y, z, t)|2dxdydz ≡1 .
In summary:
Each “particle” can be represented by a three-
dimensional wave packet, described by the wave
function ψ(x, y, z, t). The real positive quantity
P(x, y, z, t)dxdydz = |ψ(x, y, z, t)|2dxdydz
gives the probability of ﬁnding the particle at the
time t within the volume dV = dxdydz around
the point (x, y, z). The probability is maximum
at the center of the wave packet, which moves
with the group velocity vg through space which
is identical with the particle velocity vp.
Note, however, that the probability is larger than
zero not only at the point (x, y, z), but also within a ﬁ-
nite volume dV around (x, y, z). This means that it is
not possible to localize the particle exactly at the point
(x, y, z). The localization of the particle is only possi-
ble within an uncertainty that is related to the spatial
width of the corresponding wave packet. We will now
discuss this aspect in more detail.
3.3.3 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
We choose a wave packet as a superposition of plane
waves with amplitudes C(k), following the Gaussian
distribution
C(k) = C0e−[(a/2)2(k−k0)2]
(3.61)
around the central wavenumber k0. The one-dimens-
ional wave packet then becomes
ψ(x, t) = C0
+∞

−∞
e−[(a/2)(k−k0)]2ei(kx−ωt)dk .
(3.62)
with C0 = √a/(2π)3/4. The integration over k is ana-
lytically possible and yields at t = 0
ψ(x, 0) =
 2
πa2
1/4
e−x2/a2eik0x ,
(3.63a)
where we have chosen C0 = √a/(2π)3/4 in order to
obtain the normalized wave function with the probabil-
ity density
|ψ(x, 0)|2 =

2
πa2 e−2x2/a2 ,
(3.63b)

3.3. Matter Waves and Wave Functions
107
which satisﬁes the condition
+∞

−∞
|ψ(x, 0)|2dx = 1
as can be readily veriﬁed.
The wave packet (3.63) has its maximum amplitude
at x = 0. At the points x1,2 = ±a/2 the probability
density has dropped to 1/√e of the maximum val-
ue. The interval Δx = x1 −x2 = a is deﬁned as the
full width of the wave packet (3.63). The full width
Δk = k1 −k2 of the amplitude distribution C(k) be-
tween the values k1 and k2 where C(k1,2) = C0/√e is,
according to (3.62) Δk = 1/a.
This yields the important result (Fig. 3.31):
Δx · Δk = 1
(3.64a)
The product of spatial width Δx and wavenum-
ber width Δk is for a gaussian wave packet Δx ·
Δk = 1.
This result might already be familiar to you from
optics. In every spectrometer the smallest, still resolv-
able frequency interval Δωmin = 1/Δtmax is limited

With Δω = cΔk and Δx = cΔtmax this gives again
Δkmin · Δxmax = 1.
Therefore the result Δk · Δx ≥1 is not specif-
ic for quantum physics, but is typical for any
wave model. Its signiﬁcance for the quantum me-
chanical description of particles stems from the
interpretation of |ψ|2 as probability density of the
location of the particle.
With the de Broglie relation px = ¯hkx for the mo-
mentum px of a particle moving in x direction, one
obtains from (3.64a) the relation
Δx · Δpx = ¯h .
(3.64b)
It can be proved [3.16] that a Gaussian wave packet
has the minimum product Δx · Δpx. For all other am-
plitude distributions C(k), the product becomes larger.
We, therefore arrive at the uncertainty principle, ﬁrst
formulated by Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901–1975,
Fig. 3.32)

3. Development of Quantum Physics
Δx · Δpx ≥¯h .
(3.64c)
The product of the uncertainty Δx in the local-
ization of a particle, deﬁned as the spatial width
of its wave packet, and the uncertainty Δpx of the
particle’s momentum px, deﬁned as the width of
the momentum distribution C(k) with k = p/¯h,
cannot be smaller than ¯h.
This illustrates that Planck’s constant h (or the re-
duced constant ¯h = h/2π) does not only describe the
quantization of photon energies but also governs the
uncertainty relation. This is due to the de Broglie rela-
tion λdB = h/p between the momentum p of a particle
and the wavelength λdB of its matter wave.
Remark
Often, one deﬁnes the width Δx of a Gaussian distribu-
tion as the interval between the points x1 and x2 where
the function |ψ(x)|2 in (3.63b) drops down to 1/e (in-
stead of 1√e) of its maximum value and the width Δk
between the values k1 and k2 where C(k) drops to 1/e
of C(k0). This deﬁnition then results in Δk =
√
2/a
and Δx =
√
2 · a and instead of (3.64a) and (3.64c)one
obtains the uncertainty product
Δx · Δk = 2
or
Δx · Δpx ≥2¯h
(3.65)
If the width of the wave packet with constant am-
plitudes C0 is chosen as the distance between the ﬁrst
zero points on both sides of the central maximum
(Fig. 3.27a) we obtain from (3.56b) instead of (3.64b),
the relation
Δx · Δpx ≥2h = 4π ¯h ,
(3.66)
which means that for this deﬁnition of Δx, Δpx the
uncertainty product is 4π times larger than in (3.64b).
This should remind you that the numerical value
of the lower limit for the product Δx · Δpx de-
pends on the deﬁnition of the uncertainties Δx,
Δpx and on the form of the wave packet.
For the other directions y and z of a three-
dimensional Gaussian wave packet one obtains in an
analogous way:
Δy · Δpy ≥¯h ,
Δz · Δpz ≥¯h .
(3.67)
We will now illustrate the uncertainty principle using
some examples.
a) Diffraction of Electrons
Passing Through a Slit
We regard a parallel beam of electrons with momentum
p = {0, py, 0} and a large beam diameter incident onto
a narrow slit with width Δx = b (Fig. 3.33). Before the
slit, the x component of the momentum of the electrons
is px = 0, but we cannot know the x coordinates of an
individual electron, that is, Δx = ∞. Of all electrons
only those with x coordinates within the interval x =
0 ± b/2 can pass through the slit. For these electrons
we know their x coordinates within the uncertainty b,
i.e., Δx = b.
According to the uncertainty principle (3.66), their
momentum components px must have the uncertain-
ty Δpx ≥h/b. Since Δpx = py · sin θ ≈p · sin θ, this
means that the electrons can be found within the angu-
lar interval −Θ ≤ϕ ≤Θ where
sin Θ = ±Δpx

Fig. 3.33. Diffraction of electrons by a slit as explained by
the uncertainty relation

3.3. Matter Waves and Wave Functions
109
When we describe the electrons by their matter wave
with the de Broglie wavelength λdB = h/p, the wave
is diffracted by the slit, as in wave optics, and the cen-
tral diffraction maximum has an angular width Δϕ =
2Θ between the two ﬁrst minima. The wave model
gives
sin Θ = λ
b = h
bp ,
(3.68b)
which turns out to be identical to (3.68a).
This illustrates that the uncertainty principle just
takes into account the description of particles
by matter waves. If this is accepted, the re-
lations (3.64) and (3.68) follow from classical
diffraction theory.
b) Spatial Resolution Limit of the Microscope
Assume one wants to measure the location x of a parti-
cle at rest by illuminating it with light of wavelength λ
(Fig. 3.34).
The photon must be scattered by the particle into
the solid angle with apex angle 2α in order to reach
the collimating lens of the microscope with diameter d,
where sin α ≈tan α = d/2y. The uncertainty Δpx of
the photon momentum px is then
Δpx = px sin α ≈
h
λdB
d
2y = h
λ · d
2y ,
(3.69)
because the de Broglie wavelength of a photon
λdB = h
p = h · c
h · ν = λ
equals the wavelength λ of the light wave.
Conservation of momentum requires that the scat-
tering particle must suffer a recoil px with the uncer-
tainty Δpx.
Parallel light entering from above the collimating
lens (Fig. 3.34b) produces in the focal plane, at a dis-
tance y from the lens, a diffraction pattern where the
central maximum has the diameter
D = 1.2 · 2y sin Θ ≈2y λ
d
(3.70)
(see textbooks on optics).
This shows that the location x of the scattering par-
ticle can not be deﬁned more accurately than within

(3.71)
When using light with shorter wavelength λ, the uncer-
tainty Δx becomes smaller, but the uncertainty Δpx of
the particles momentum becomes accordingly larger.
This example illustrates that the measuring pro-
cess itself (here the illumination of the particle)
changes the state of the measured object (here its
momentum and location).
3.3.4 Dispersion of the Wave Packet
According to (3.57) the group velocity vg of the wave
packet is related to the momentum p and the velocity
vp of the corresponding particle by
vg = p
m = vp .
(3.72)
The initial momentum p can be determined only within
the uncertainty interval Δp. This implies a correspond-
ing uncertainty

Fig. 3.35. Spread of a wave packet in time for two different
initial uncertainties Δx(t1)
where Δx0 is the initial width of the wave packet,
i.e., the uncertainty of the determination of the starting
point x0. Because of the uncertainty Δvg of the velocity
the uncertainty Δx = Δvgt + Δx0 increases with time.
We obtain
Δx(t) = Δvgt + Δx0 ≥
¯h

The width Δx(t) of the wave packet therefore increas-
es with time while the area

constant because of the normalization

−∞
|ψ(x, t)|2dx = 1 .
The rate with which Δx(t) increases becomes larg-
er when Δx0 is smaller, because the uncertainty Δvg
increases as ¯h/(mΔx0) (Fig. 3.35). The localization
of a particle moving with velocity vg ± Δvg becomes
more and more uncertain after its initial parame-
ters (x0 ± Δx0, vg ± Δvg)t=0 had been determined
at t = 0.
3.3.5 Uncertainty Relation for Energy and Time
In Sect. 3.3.3 we have discussed the spatial width Δx of
a wave packet which is composed of an inﬁnite number
of monochromatic waves with wavenumbers k within
the interval k −Δk/2 ≤k ≤k + Δk/2. We will now
investigate how accurate the energy ¯hω0 at the center
frequency ω0 of a wave packet can be measured, when
the measuring time is Δt. We consider a wave packet
composed of monochromatic waves Ai exp[i(ωit −

We now integrate over the frequency interval Δω in-
stead over the wavenumber interval Δk. We therefore
write the wave packet as the superposition
ψ(x, t) =

tral maximum to pass through the point x0, where the
measurement is performed.
On the other hand, when a wave packet is only
observed during the time interval Δt, its central fre-
quency ω0 can only be measured within an uncertainty
Δω = 2π/Δt. This can be proved as shown below.
When a monochromatic wave
ψ(x, t) = A0ei(ω0t−k0x)
is measured only during the time interval Δt at x =
0 the Fourier transform of the wave train gives the
amplitude distribution

which determines the frequency spectrum of the wave
train. The central maximum of this distribution has
a width Δω = 2π/Δt, deﬁned by half the distance
ω1 −ω2 between the zero points of (3.77) at ω1 =
ω0 + 2π/Δt and ω2 = ω0 −2π/Δt.
Since the energy E = ¯hω is related to the frequen-
cy ω we obtain the uncertainty relation
ΔE · Δt ≥2π ¯h = h
(3.78)
between energy E and observation time Δt.
When a particle is observed only during the
limited time interval Δt, its energy E can be
determined only within the uncertainty limits
ΔE ≥h/Δt.
Remark
1. If a Gaussian amplitude distribution A(ω) is as-
sumed instead of the constant amplitude A(ω) ≡
A0, the smallest uncertainty ΔE · Δt ≥¯h is ob-
tained analogously to (3.64).
2. Equation (3.78) has been derived from classical
physics, using the Fourier theorem. The quantum
mechanical aspect comes only from the relation
E = hν = ¯hω.
3.4 The Quantum Structure of Atoms
Rutherford’s
scattering
experiments
discussed
in
Chap. 2 have proved that atoms consist of a nucleus
with positive charge Q = +Ze, a small radius RK ≤
10−14 m and a mass that nearly equals that of the total
atom, and of Z electrons with very small masses, occu-
pying, however, a volume that is about 1012–1015 times
larger than that of the nucleus.
Up to now we have not discussed any possible
structure of the spatial and energy distribution of
the atomic electrons. In particular it must be cleared
whether the electrons move around within the atom
or whether they are at rest and form a static charge
distribution. Both assumptions lead to certain contra-
dictions: Because of the attractive Coulomb force be-
tween the positively charged nucleus and the negatively
charged electrons a static conﬁguration would not be
stable. A dynamical model in which the electrons move
on closed paths within the atom and must therefore
be continuously accelerated, cannot explain why these
accelerated charges do not radiate, as postulated by

112

electrodynamics. They would then loose energy and
would also become unstable.
The experiments presented in the following sec-
tions have essentially contributed to clarifying these
questions.
3.4.1 Atomic Spectra
In 1859 Gustav Kirchhoff (1824–1887) and Robert
Bunsen (1811–1899) had already found, through joint
research, that atoms only absorb or emit light at certain
discrete wavelengths λi. These speciﬁc wavelengths
that are characteristic of each chemical element, are
called the absorption or emission spectra of the atom.
These spectra are like a ﬁngerprint of the atom, since
every atomic species can be unambiguously recognized
by its spectrum.
A possible experimental arrangement for measuring
emission spectra is shown in Fig. 3.37a.
The light emitted by atoms in the light source
(which might be, for instance, a gas discharge or
a high current arc between two electrodes of the ma-
terial to be investigated) is collected by the lens L1
and imaged onto the entrance slit S1 of the spectro-
graph, which is placed in the focal plane of lens L2.

different exposure times
prism and the lens L3 images the entrance slit on-
to the observation plane, where the position of the
slit image S2(λ) depends on the wavelength λ. If the
light source emits light with discrete wavelengths λK,
the photoplate in the observation plane shows after
being developed dark lines at all those positions xK
that correspond to slit images S2(λK). Such a spec-
trum as that in Fig. 3.37b) is therefore called a line
spectrum. Many light sources emit continuous spectra,
i.e., their emitted intensity I(λ) is a continuous func-
tion of the wavelength λ. Examples are the radiation
of the sun’s photosphere, the emission of a blackbody
(see Sect. 3.2) and generally the emission of hot solid
bodies.
Absorption spectra can be measured with the set-
up shown in Fig. 3.38. The radiation from a continuous
light source is collimated by the lens L1 and the paral-
lel light bundle is sent through the absorbing gaseous
sample. The lens L2 focuses the transmitted radiation
onto the entrance slit of a spectrograph. At those wave-
lengths λK, where the sample atoms absorb light, the
transmitted intensity is smaller than at nonabsorbing
wavelengths. The negative of the illuminated photo-
plate therefore shows bright lines on a dark background
(Fig. 3.38b).
Such experiments brought about the following re-
sults:
•
Each wavelength observed in an absorption spec-
trum also appears in the emission spectrum of the
same kind of atoms if the atoms have been excited
into the emitting state by absorption of light or by
collisional excitation.
•
The absorption and emission spectra are charac-
teristic for speciﬁc atoms. They allow the unam-
biguous determination of the chemical element cor-
responding to these spectra. The spectral analysis
therefore yields the composition of chemical ele-
ments in a sample. This is particularly important
in astrophysics where the spectrum of the starlight
gives information on the number and the composi-
tion of chemical elements in the atmosphere of the
star.
•
The spectral lines are not completely narrow, even
if the spectral resolution of the spectrograph is ex-
tremely high. This means that the atoms do not emit
strictly monochromatic radiation but show an inten-
sity distribution I(λK) around each wavelength λK

The most simple of all atoms is the H atom, consist-
ing of only one proton and one electron. Its emission
spectrum (Fig. 3.39) was measured in 1885 by Johann
Jakob Balmer (1825–1898). He could ﬁt the wavenum-
bers ¯νK = 1/λK of its emission lines by the simple

torically given by spectroscopists in units of inverse
centimeters cm−1, since all wavenumbers ¯νK = 1/λK
are measured in these units.

la (3.79), but with n1 = 1 (Lyman series) or n1 = 3
(Paschen series) (Fig. 3.40).
How can we understand these experimental results?
3.4.2 Bohr’s Atomic Model
Many theoriticians tried to develop models that could
explain the experimental ﬁndings. However, most of
these models could describe some results but not all
of them in a consistent way without any contradictions.
After many efforts Nils Bohr (1885–1962) (Fig. 3.41)
starting from Rutherford’s atomic model ﬁnally de-
veloped in 1913 the famous planetary model of the
atoms [3.4, 17], which we will now discuss for atom-
ic systems with only one electron (H atom, He+ ion,
Li++ ion, etc.).
In Bohr’s atomic model the electron (mass me,
charge −e) and the nucleus (mass mN, charge +Ze)
both move on circles with radius re or rN, respectively,

tial Epot(r) around the center r = 0, where r is the
distance between electron and nucleus. The balance be-

no further restrictions for the kinetic energy (μ/2)v2
any radius r is possible, according to (3.81).
If, however, the electron is described by its matter
wave with wavelength λdB = h/(μv) a stationary state
of the atom must be described by a standing wave along
the circle (Fig. 3.42) since the electron should not leave
the atom. This gives the quantum condition:
2πr = nλdB
(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) ,
(3.82)

ues (3.82). With the de Broglie wavelength λdB =

3. Development of Quantum Physics
This illustrates that the total energy of the atom in
the center of mass system (which nearly equals the en-
ergy of the electron) can only have discrete values for
stationary energy states, which are described by the
quantum number n = 1, 2, 3. . . . (Fig. 3.40). Such a sta-
tionary energy state of the atom is called a quantum
state. In Bohr’s model, the quantum number n equals
the number of periods of the standing de Broglie wave
along the circular path of the electron.
Note:
1. The exact value of the Rydberg constant Ry de-
pends, according to (3.88), on the reduced mass μ
of the electron nucleus system. It differs, there-
fore, slightly for different masses of the nucleus. In
order to have a unique deﬁnition, the Rydberg con-
stant Ry∞for inﬁnite nuclear mass mN = ∞⇒
μ = me is deﬁned. Its numerical value is Ry∞=
109,737.31534 cm−1.
The Rydberg constant for ﬁnite nuclear mass mN
is then:
Ry = Ry∞μ/me .
2. Bohr’s atomic model is a “semiclassical model”,
which treats the movement of the electron as that
of a point mass on a classical path but adds an addi-
tional quantum condition (which is in fact a bound-
ary condition for the de Broglie wavelength of the
moving electron).
3. This quantum condition can also be formulated
using the angular momentum L of the electron.
Multiplying (3.83) by μr yields
μrv = |L| = n¯h ,
where ¯h = h/2π. This means:
The angular momentum of the electron on its
path around the nucleus is quantized. The abso-
lute value n¯h is an integer multiple of Planck’s
constant ¯h.
The two conditions:
a) The angular momentum of the atom in the center of
mass system is |L| = n¯h
b) The circumference of the circular path of the elec-
tron 2πr = nλdB must be an integer multiple of the
de Broglie wavelength
are identical. They are both due to the boundary
condition for the standing de Broglie wave.
In order to explain the line spectra observed in ab-
sorption or emission, the following hypothesis is added
to Bohr’s model.
By absorption of a photon hν the atom can be excit-
ed from a lower energy State Ei into a higher state Ek,
if the energy conservation
hνik = Ek −Ei
(3.89)
is fulﬁlled. Inserting the relation (3.87) for the energies
Ek, Ei yields the frequencies

of the absorbed light. With the wave numbers ¯ν =
ν/c and Ry∗= hc · Ry we obtain for the hydrogen
atom (Z = 1) exactly Balmer’s formula (3.79) for his
observed spectra.
When emitting a photon hν, the atom undergoes
a transition from a higher energy state Ek to a lower
state Ei, where again energy conservation (3.89) has to
be fulﬁlled.
We will summarize the preceding results of Bohr’s
model of hydrogenic atoms with a single electron.
•
The electron moves on circles around the
nucleus with quantized radii
rn = n2

that increase quadratically with the integer
quantum number n.
•
The possible values rn are inversely propor-
tional to the nuclear charge Ze. For the He+
ion with Z = 2 they are only half as large as
in the hydrogen atom.
•
In each quantum state the atom has a well-
deﬁned total energy
En = −Ry∗Z2
n2 ,
Epot = +2En ,
Ekin = −En .
The energy E∞= 0 for n = ∞and rn →∞
is chosen as zero. In its lowest possible state
the energy is E1 = −Ry∗Z2. Therefore the

3.4. The Quantum Structure of Atoms
117
positive energy −E1 is necessary to ionize
the atom in its ground state (i.e., to bring the
electron from r = r1 to r = ∞). It is called
the ionization energy. For the H atom the
ionization energy is Eion = 13.6 eV.
•
By absorption of a photon hν = Ek −Ei the
atom can be excited from its lower energy
state Ei into the higher state Ek. Emission of
a photon by an excited atom causes a transi-
tion from Ek to Ei.
Note:
The ﬁrst excited state (n = 2) of the H atom already
needs an excitation energy of about 10.2 eV, which is
3/4 of the ionization energy.
Although Bohr’s semiclassical atomic model ex-
plains the observed spectra very well, and also brings
some esthetical satisfaction, because of its resemblance
to the planetary system, it leaves several questions
open. One essential point is that, according to classi-
cal electrodynamics, every accelerated charge should
emit radiation. The electron on its circular path is such
an accelerated charge. It should, therefore, loose ener-
gy by emitting radiation and should spiral down into
the nucleus. Therefore, the Bohr model cannot explain
the existence of stable atoms.
3.4.3 The Stability of Atoms
The stability of atoms is consistently explained by
quantum theory. We will here give a conspicuous ar-
gument based on the uncertainty relation. It should be
only regarded as a simple estimation that is not re-
stricted to circular paths of the electron. If a is the
mean radius of the atom, we can give the distance r
of the electron from the nucleus with an uncertain-
ty Δr ≤a, since we know that the electron has to be
found somewhere within the atom. According to the
uncertainty relation the uncertainty Δpr of the radial
component of the electron momentum p must be larger
than ¯h/a. Therefore we conclude for the uncertain-
ty Δp ≥Δpr ≥¯h/a (otherwise we could determine p
within narrower limits than its component pr). We ﬁnd
the relation p > Δp ≥¯h/a. The mean kinetic energy
of the electron is:
Ekin =
p2
2me
≥(Δp)2
2me
≥
¯h2
2mea2 .
(3.91)
Its potential energy at a distance a from the nucleus is
Epot = −
e2
4πε0a
(3.92)
and its total energy E = Ekin + Epot at the distance a is
then:
E ≥
¯h2
2ma2 −
e2
4πε0a .
(3.93)
The largest probability of ﬁnding the electron is at
a distance amin where the total energy is minimum, i.e.,
where dE/da = 0. This gives
amin = 4πε0 ¯h2
me2
= ε0h2
πμe2 = a0
(3.94)
which is identical to the Bohr radius a0.
Therefore, a stable state exists with the minimum
energy limit
Emin = −
me4
2(4πε0 ¯h2)2 = −me4
8ε2
0h2 = −Ry∗,
(3.95)
which is consistent with the energy of the lowest state
with n = 1 in Bohr’s model.
Although the quantum mechanical results for the
energy conﬁrms Bohr’s result, the explanation of the
stability is different.
According to the uncertainty principle the atom in
its lowest state cannot radiate because it has minimum
energy. In order to emit a photon, it would have to
make a transition to a higher energy state, which con-
tradicts energy conservation. The reason for this energy
minimum is the sharp increase of the kinetic energy
of the electron with decreasing distance a, due to the
uncertainty of its momentum (Fig. 3.43). In higher en-
ergy states the atom can radiate, in accordance with the
experimental results.
In Bohr’s model the stability is explained by the as-
sumption of standing waves for the electron, where the
Poynting vector is zero. However, this does not explain
why higher energy states, which are also represented
by standing waves, do radiate.

118
3. Development of Quantum Physics
3.4.4 Franck–Hertz Experiment
James Franck and Gustav Hertz [3.18] gave in 1914
an impressive experimental proof for the energy quan-
tization of atoms based on the following experimental
arrangement (Fig. 3.44a).
Electrons, emitted from a hot cathode in a bulb,
ﬁlled with mercury vapor at low pressures, are accel-
erated to the energy Ekin = eU by the grid G at the
voltage U against the cathode. The electrons can only
reach the collecting anode A that is kept at a lower volt-
age UA = U −ΔU, if their energy after having passed
the grid G is at least eΔU.
When measuring the electron current IA(U) as
a function of the acceleration voltage U, one obtains
a curve like that in Fig. 3.44b. The current increases
with U between U = 0 and U = 4.9 eV and follows
a typical diode characteristics. Above U1 = 4.9 V the
current decreases sharply, goes through a minimum,
rises again until it reaches a second maximum at about
Ue = 9.8 eV.
How can this be explained?
The electrons suffer elastic and inelastic collisions
with the Hg atoms. In inelastic collisions,
e−(Ekin) + Hg →Hg∗(Ea) + e−(Ekin −Ea)
the electrons excite the Hg atoms and transfer the
amount ΔEkin = Ekin −Ea of their kinetic energy to
the excitation energy Ea of the atom. Because of this
loss of energy the electrons cannot overcome the bias
voltage −ΔU and therefore cannot reach the detector.
During elastic collisions the electron can at most
transfer the fraction 4me/mHg ≈10−5 of its kinetic en-
ergy. At sufﬁciently low pressures each electron suffers
only a few elastic collisions and the total energy loss
due to elastic collisions is then completely negligible.
However, elastic collisions may result in large angu-
lar changes of the electron’s ﬂight direction and the
electrons may therefore hit the walls of the tube be-
fore they reach the anode. Without inelastic collisions
the electron current would follow the dashed curve in
Fig. 3.44b, which resembles the electron current in
a diode tube. The further maxima and minima in the
actually measured current I(UA) are due to the fact that
at sufﬁciently large voltages U the electron can regain,
after n inelastic collisions, the minimum required kinet-
ic energy eΔU during its ﬂight path to the grid G for

The separation between subsequent maxima cor-
responds to the excitation energy Ea = 4.9 eV of Hg
atoms. The exact form of the curve I(U) in Fig. 3.44 is
determined by
•
The energy dependence of the excitation probabili-
ty
•
The energy distribution of the electrons emitted
from the hot cathode.

3.4. The Quantum Structure of Atoms

With the improved experimental setup of Fig. 3.45a
the energy resolution could be substantially improved.
Here, two grids are used and the acceleration of the
electrons is essentially restricted to the short ﬂight path
between K and G1, while the small adjustable volt-
age U2 between G2 and G1 does not change the electron
energy much. The excitation probability is then nearly
the same for all points between G1 and G2. With such
an improved apparatus the ﬁner details of the excitation

The excited Hg∗atoms release their excitation en-
ergy by emission of light
Hg∗→Hg + hν .
Measuring this ﬂuorescence light through a monochro-
mator shows that the emitted spectral lines have wave-
lengths λk, which exactly correspond to the measured
absorption lines of Hg vapor. Time-resolved measure-
ments of this ﬂuorescence prove that the excited atomic
levels Ei are not stable. They decay within a very
short time (typically ≈10−8 s) into lower states Ek,
where
ΔE = Ek −Ei = hνik = hc/λik .
Only the lowest atomic states (called the ground states)
are stable. Their lifetimes are inﬁnitely long (if not
excited by collisions or absorption of photons). The
wavelength λik of the emission spectrum measured
through a spectrograph allow a much higher accura-
cy in the determination of energy levels than those
obtained from the electron impact measurements in
Figs. 3.45 and 3.46.

3. Development of Quantum Physics
The experimental results of the electron impact
excitation prove that atoms can acquire energy
only in discrete energy quanta ΔE. Their mag-
nitude depend on the speciﬁc atom and its level
structure.
3.5 What are the Differences Between
Classical and Quantum Physics?
In the quantum physical description of microparticles,
such as atoms, molecules, electrons and photons, there
is no distinct separation between particle model and
wave model. The matter wave function is character-
ized by the particle momentum p and energy E as
well as by the de Broglie wavelength λ or the fre-
quency ν = E/h. The examples given in the previous
sections have illustrated the particle nature of light and
the wave properties of particles. In this section we
will discuss the particle-wave duality of microparticles
and make clear, by some more instructive examples,
that this duality does not give contradictory but rather
complementary descriptions of nature.
3.5.1 Classical Particle Paths Versus Probability
Densities in Quantum Physics
The classical path of a particle can be exactly pre-
dicted, at least in principle, for all times, if the initial
conditions (e.g., r(t = 0) and v(t = 0)) and the forces
acting on the particle are known. For the model of
point-like massive particles the equation of motion
(Newton’s equation F = ma) can be solved either an-
alytically or numerically with computers within any
wanted accuracy.
For linear equations of motion, small inaccuracies
of the initial conditions results in only small uncertain-
ties of the further path r(t) of the particles.
However, many phenomena in nature have to be
described by nonlinear equations of motion (e.g., the
motion of a particle in a turbulent ﬂow). Here, tiny
changes in the initial conditions may already change
the future development of the particles motion drasti-
cally. For such “chaotic” movements the exact calcula-
tion of the motion r(t) is in principle not possible, even
in “classical physics.”
Quantum physics brings, through the uncertainty
relations, an additional principal limit to the calculation
of the time development of a physical system.
•
The initial conditions r(0) and p(0) for location
and momentum of a particle can not be both given
simultaneously exactly but only within uncertain-
ty limits. The product Δxi · Δpi (i = x, y, z) of
the uncertainty Δxi, Δpi cannot be smaller than
Planck’s constant ¯h (Fig. 3.47). Instead of the clas-
sical well-deﬁned path represented by the solid
curve in Fig. 3.47 the location x(t) can be only
determined within a certain area Δx · Δt, schemati-
cally shown by the coloured area in Fig. 3.47, which
becomes larger over the course of time.
•
The determination of the exact paths r(t) of single
particles is replaced in quantum physics by proba-
bility statements. It is only possible to determine the
probability P(x, p, t) to ﬁnd a microparticle with
momentum p(t) at the location x(t) at time t.
•
Measurements of x and p changes the state of the
micro-particle (see Sect. 3.3.3).
•
The probability of ﬁnding a particle at time t at the
location x is related to its wave function ψ(x, t).
Averaging over a large number of identical mea-
surements gives the mean probability |ψ(x, t)|2dx
to ﬁnd the particle at time t within the spatial inter-
val dx around x. In the classical wave description
this corresponds to the normalized intensity of the
wave at (x, t).

•
The spatial uncertainty Δx of a particle corresponds
to its de Broglie wavelength λdB = h/p = h/mv.
While this uncertainty plays an essential role for
microparticles, it is generally completely negligi-
ble for macro particles because of their large mass.
Only under special conditions (electrons in met-
als or neutrons in neutron stars) the uncertainty
relation remains essential for macroscopic bodies.
Of course, it is responsible for the stability of
atoms (see Sect. 3.4.3) and therefore of matter in
general.
3.5.2 Interference Phenomena
with Light Waves and Matter Waves
The observation of interference phenomena had been
always regarded as convincing proof for the wave mod-
el of light. In this section we will illustrate the physical
essence of the quantum description of particles by mat-
ter waves, discussing several modiﬁcations of Young’s
double slit experiment, performed with:
•
Macroscopic particles
•
Light
•
Electrons
a) Macroscopic Particles
A spray gun SP in Fig. 3.48a produces a divergent
beam of small dye particles ( ≈1 μm), which hits
a screen with the two narrow slits S1 and S2 (width b,
separation d >> b.) at the position x = x1. At the
position x2 behind the screen the transmitted par-
ticles hit a glass plate G, where they stick to the
surface. The intensity I(y) of the transmitted parti-
cles can be measured by the density of the deposited
dye layer.
When we close the slit S2, we obtain the density-
distribution I1(y) (dashed curve) when closing S1,
a slightly shifted distribution I2(y) is measured. When
both slits are open, the measured intensity distribu-
tion I(y) = I1(y) + I2(y) equals the sum of the two
distributions of each slit, as could have been expected.
With macroscopic particles no interference phe-
nomena are observed!
Ph
P(Y)
Fig. 3.48. a,b Young’s double slit experiment (a) with macro-
scopic dye particles and (b) with photons
b) Light
When we replace the spray gun by a light source LS
and the glass plate by a photoplate Ph we observe for
a proper choice of the slit dimensions (b ≈2λ, d > b)
similar intensity distributions as in Sect. a, if only one
of the slits is open. They correspond to the central
diffraction maximum for the diffraction by a single slit.
However, if both slits are open, the observed intensi-
ty does not equal the sum I1 + I2, but an interference
pattern appears that can be described by
I(y) = |A1(y) + A2(y)|2
= I1 + I2 + 2A1 A2 cos(Δϕ(y)) ,
(3.96)
where Ai is the amplitude of the partial wave transmit-
ted through the slit Si and Δϕ = (2π/λ)Δs is the phase
difference between the two interfering partial waves at
the point P(y) on the photoplate, resulting from the
path difference Δs(y) = S1P(y) −S2P(y).

122
3. Development of Quantum Physics
Now we perform an important modiﬁcation of the
experiment.
We gradually decrease the intensity I0 of the light
source until at most one photon is traversing the system
during the passage time Δt = D/c with D = D1 + D2
from the source to the detector. There is then always
at most one photon on the way. Its arrival time and
location in the detector plane can be measured when
replacing the photoplate by an array of many small
photo detectors (CCD-array). The photon can only pass
through one of the two slits. If it passed simultaneous-
ly through both slits, each slit would have transmitted
half a photon 1
2 ¯hω, in contradiction to Planck’s hy-
pothesis that ¯hω is the smallest energy unit of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld.
If the experiment is continued over a sufﬁcient-
ly long time period in order to collect a sufﬁciently
large signal, one again observes an interference pat-
tern. This interference could not have been produced
by the interaction between different photons, passing
simultaneously through the two slits.
If two shutters are placed in front of the two slits,
which open alternately at a deﬁned time, so that the ob-
server knows which slit is open, the interference pattern
disappears! The intensity in the observation plane then
becomes
I = I1 + I2 .
This illustrates that the interference pattern only
appears when we do not know through which of
the two slits a photon has passed, although we
know that it must have passed through one of the
two slits. We can only state that the probability is
P = 0.5 for passing through one of the two slits.
The quantum physical description is unambigu-
ous. If ψ1 is the wave function of the photon passing
through slit S1 and ψ2 for passing through S2 the wave
function must be ψ = ψ1 + ψ2 for the case that both
slits are open and we do not know through which slit
the photon has passed. The probability of detecting
a photon in the observation plane is therefore:
|ψ(x = x1 + x2, y)|2 = |ψ1 + ψ2|2
= |ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2 + ψ∗
1 ψ2 + ψ1ψ∗
2 .
(3.97a)
The last two terms represent the interference. If we
assume (following Huygen’s principle) that each point
of the slit acts as a source of an outgoing spherical wave
ψi = Ai
r ei(kir−ωt)
the interference term becomes for A1 = A2 = A:
ψ∗
1 ψ2 + ψ∗
2 ψ1 = A2
r2 cos [k(s1 −s2)] ,
(3.97b)
where si is the distance between slit Si and the point of
observation P(y).
If the slit S1 is closed, ψ1 becomes zero and the
interference disappears.
c) Electrons
Instead of the light source in Sect. b we now use
an electron gun, which emits a divergent electron
beam covering both slits. A spatially resolving elec-
tron detector (CCD-array) in the plane x = x1 + x2
measures the transmitted electrons. The observed in-
tensity pattern is quite similar to that in Sect. b if
all quantities (b, d, x1 + x2) are scaled by the ratio
λ/λdB of light wavelength λ and the de Broglie wave-
length λdB. The experiment shows that electrons al-
so produce interference patterns due to their wave
properties if the ratios λdB/b and b/d are chosen
properly.
We will now discuss another, very instructive
“Gedanken-experiment” as a modiﬁcation of the pre-
vious experiment. When a light source LS is placed

two slits the electron has passed

3.5. What are the Differences Between Classical and Quantum Physics?
123
behind the plane of the two slits, it can illuminate
electrons passing through one of the slits (Fig. 3.49).
The light scattered from the electron could be de-
tected by one of the two detectors Di (i = 1, 2) and
gives information about the location of the electron just
behind the slit. In this way it should be possible to de-
cide through which of the two slits the electron has
passed.
If the detector Di and simultaneously a pixel of the
CCD-array in the plane x = x1 + x2 deliver a signal
pulse we know that an electron has passed through
slit S1 and has impinged onto the point P(y) in the
plane x = x1 + x2. Will there be still an interference
pattern? Quantum mechanics says “no,” in accor-
dance with the experimental results. How can this be
understood?
The collision between photon and electron changes
the electron’s momentum and the direction of its
velocity. As was shown in Sect. 3.4 for the example
of the microscope, the momentum change is Δpy ≤
h/d, if d is the spatial resolution, i.e., the uncertainty,
with which the location of the scatterer can be deter-
mined. The electron then arrives at the detection plane
at another point (x = x1 + x2, y + Δy). The statistical
distribution with a width Δy = (Δpy/py)x2 becomes
larger than the distance Δ = (λ/d)x2 = h/(pyd)x2.
This means, the interference is completely washed out
if the uncertainty of the electron’s location in the plane
of the slits S1, S2 becomes smaller than the slit dis-
tance d. The measuring process change the conditions
for observation and destroys partly or completely the
interference.
New experiments reveal, however, that the recoil
during the measuring processes of the electron’s lo-
cation is not the main cause of the disappearance of
the interference pattern, but the knowledge about the
way of the electron (see Sect. 12.5). This has been
proved by measuring the interference pattern in a spe-
ciﬁc designed atom interferometer. The path of an
atom in an atom-interferometer can be inferred from
preparing speciﬁc atomic states by microwave absorp-
tion. Because the microwave frequency ν is much
smaller than that of visible light, its momentum p =
hν/c transferred to an atom is completely negligible.
Nevertheless, any interference phenomena at the exit of
an atom interferometer disappeared when knowledge
was gained about which way an atom had gone [12.4].
We can therefore summarize:
Interference phenomena for light or particle
waves are due to the principal lack of knowl-
edge about the exact path of particles through the
interference device.
The probability description of Born’s statistical
interpretation of matter waves can be illustrated by
the following example. When in the arrangement of
Fig. 3.48 only a single electron is detected at (x =
D, y), we do not know, whether it has passed through
slit S1 or S2. However, we can give the probability am-
plitude ψ1(y) that the electron has passed through S1
and is detected at (x = D, y) or ψ2(y) for its passage
through S2. For a coherent superposition the ampli-
tudes have to be added. The total probability, to ﬁnd
the electron at the position y in the detector plane,
independent of its way through S1 or S2 is then
|ψ(y)|2 = |ψ1(y −y1) + ψ2(y −y2)|2
= |ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2 + ψ∗
1 ψ2 + ψ1ψ∗
2 . (3.98)
Since the probability to ﬁnd the electron somewhere in
the detector plane is

|ψ(y)|2dy = 1
the detection probability for a detector that covers the
interval from y to y + dy is
P(y)dy = |ψ(y)|2dy .
When N electrons have passed per second through ei-
ther of the two slits, the counting rate of the detector
is
Z(y)dy = N|ψ(y)|2dy .
(3.99)
Inserting (3.98) gives the spatial interference structure
of the counting rate Z(y).
3.5.3 The Effect of the Measuring Process
The examples in the preceding sections have illustrated
that in the quantum mechanical description of a mea-
surement, the measuring process itself affects the result
of the measurement. When we measure the location of
a particle, we change by this measurement its momen-
tum p. This change Δp is the larger the more accurate
we measure its position. If this measurement of posi-
tion is performed with light of wavelength λ (remember

124
3. Development of Quantum Physics
that the position x cannot be measured more accurately
than by Δx ≈λ). The photon transfers the momentum
Δp = h/λ to the particle and the random direction of
the recoil momentum results in an uncertainty Δp of
the particles momentum.
The inﬂuence of the measuring process on the state
of the measured object can impose a limit to the accura-
cy of the measurement not only for microparticles but
even for macroscopic bodies.
One example is the measurement of gravitational
waves by a large metal cylinder with about 104 kg mass
suspended by elastic strings [3.20].
The gravitational waves, which are produced, for
example, by an exploding star (supernova) cause a pe-
riodic contraction and expansion ΔL of the length L
of the cylinder. For a supernovae at a distance of 105
light years the amplitude ΔL is estimated as 10−21 m.
For its measurements, two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2 =
y1) at the ends of the cylinder have to be marked.
The measurement of their position with an uncertain-
ty Δx = 10−21 m will result in the momentum transfer
Δp ≥¯h/(2Δx). If the cylinder was at rest before the
measurement, it will afterwards move with a veloc-
ity v = Δp/m ≥¯h/(2mΔx). For a frequency νG =
103 s−1 of the gravitational wave the time between two
contractions is τ ≈10−3 s. Within this time the cylin-
der moves by Δxm = vτ ≈¯hτ/(2mΔx). Inserting the
values m = 104 kg, Δx = 10−21 m, τ = 10−3 s, gives
Δxm ≥5 × 10−21 m = 5Δx .
The uncertainty of the local position of the massive
cylinder, caused by measuring its position, is therefore
larger than the shift expected due to the gravitational
wave. A way out of this dilemma is a larger mass m
and averaging over many measurements.
We note that the measuring process itself changes
the state of the measured object.
Remark
Meanwhile, several sophisticated experimental ar-
rangements have been set up that allow “quantum non-
demolishing” experiments, where information about
the measured system is obtained without altering the
state of the measured object. For more details see
Sect. 12.5 and the literature [3.21–25].
3.5.4 The Importance of Quantum Physics
for our Concept of Nature
Quantum theory can answer all open questions dis-
cussed in the preceding sections (for example concern-
ing the stability of atoms, the diffraction of electrons,
the ultraviolet disaster and the photoeffect). Its exten-
sion to quantum electrodynamics (QED) is in complete
agreement with all known experimental results within
the range of its validity, which means that all phenom-
ena associated with atoms, molecules and solids are
satisfactorily described by this QED-theory. Its lim-
itations only become visible when investigating the
nuclear structure and the properties of elementary par-
ticles. Its disadvantage is its lack of vividness. There
is, for instance, no vivid picture of the photon because
of its dual character as particle or as wave. Also the
quantum mechanical postulate that a lack of knowledge
about the way in which a particle has reached the de-
tector, causes interference phenomena, contradicts our
usual picture of classical physics.
The concept of probability and the uncertainty re-
lations have essential philosophical consequences. The
future destiny of a microparticle is no longer complete-
ly determined by its past. First of all, we only know
its initial state (location and momentum) within lim-
its set by the uncertainty relations. Furthermore, the
ﬁnal state of the system shows (even for accurate ini-
tial conditions) a probability distribution around a value
predicted by classical physics.
The possibility of exact predictions, postulated in
classical physics for exactly known initial conditions,
is restricted in quantum physics in a two-fold way.
The initial conditions are not exactly known and the
measuring process itself affects the state of the system.
This is further illustrated by the following exam-
ple in Fig. 3.50. A light beam is split by the 50%
beam splitter BS into two equally intense partial beams,
which are detected by the detectors D1 and D2. Each
of the two detectors counts the statistically imping-
ing photons and both measure on the average an equal
mean photon rate. Since a photon is indivisible, the
beam splitter BS can only either transmit or reﬂect the
photon. Which of the photons is reﬂected and which is
transmitted, is not predictable. One can only say that
the probability for each of the two processes is 0.5.
Now a second beam splitter BS1 is inserted
(Fig. 3.50b) that splits the incoming light beam into two

ing an interference pattern. (b) An additional beam splitter to

partial beams that are again superimposed at the beam
splitter BS2. From interference experiments in classi-
cal optics we know that the intensity received by the
two detectors D1, D2 depends on the phase difference
between the two interfering beams at S. At a proper
phase difference, destructive interference occurs for the
beam directed towards D2 and constructive interference
for the beam towards D1. This means that D2 receives
no light, but D1 all of the light. This is observed even
at very low light intensities, where only one photon
is simultaneously on its way from the source to the
detector.
How can the photons “know” that they now all
should travel towards D1 and not towards D2?
This example illustrates that the experimentator can
inﬂuence the future fate of photons by choosing the cor-
responding experimental arrangement. Changing the
distance BS1 −M1 −M2 −BS2 affects the splitting
ratio of BS2. This demonstrates that it is not meaningful
to attribute a deﬁnite path to the photons, but rather on-
ly a detection probability for D1 and D2, which depends
on the experimental arrangement.
During recent years several modiﬁcations of such
“which way” experiments have been demonstrated.
Their results are all in complete agreement with quan-
tum theory but cannot be explained by classical con-
cepts.
For a more detailed discussion the reader is referred
to the recommendable book of Paul [3.22] and to sever-
al other books or review articles about this interesting
ﬁeld [3.23, 24, 25].

Many experimental results prove the particle char-

emitted by a weak light source.
•
The derivation of Planck’s radiation formula
based on the photon model gives results that are
in complete agreement with experiments.
•
The energy quanta hν of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
are called photons. One can formally deﬁne the
photon mass as m = hν/c2. Photons are deﬂect-
ed by gravitational ﬁelds, like other particles with
mass m. There are no photons at rest. Nevertheless
one deﬁnes a rest mass m0 = 0, in order to de-
scribe photons by the same relativistic equations
for energy and momentum used for other particles
with m0 ̸= 0.
•
To deﬁne the characteristic properties of a photon,
such as momentum pphot = ¯hk = (h/λ)ˆk, energy
E = hν = hω and mass m = hν/c2, one needs
the wave properties frequency ν, wavelength λ
and wave vector k. This shows the duality in the
description of light.
•
The wave character of particles is proved experi-
mentally by diffraction and interference phenom-
ena. Examples are the electron diffraction, the
Bragg reﬂection of neutrons by single crystals,
neutron interferometry and numerous experiments
in atom optics, demonstrating diffraction and in-
terference of matter waves.

3. Development of Quantum Physics
•
Matter waves show dispersion, even in a vacuum.
Their phase velocity depends on the frequency ω.
•
Particles can be described by wave packets. The
particle velocity equals the group velocity of the
wave packet.
•
The absolute square |ψ(x, t)|2 of the matter wave
function represents a probability density. This
means that |ψ(x, t)|2dx gives the probability to
ﬁnd the particle at time t in the interval dx
around x.
•
Position x and momentum px of a particle
cannot be simultaneously accurately measured.
Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation Δx · Δpx ≥¯h
puts a principle lower limit to the uncertainties Δx
of the particle position and Δpx to its momen-
tum, if both are measured simultaneously. The
uncertainty limits depend on the form of the wave
packed. The lowest limit is set for a gaussion
proﬁle of the wave packet.
•
Analogous to the situation in classical optics the
uncertainty Δx for the location of a particle can-
not be smaller than the wavelength λ = h/p of its
matter wave.
•
A similar uncertainty relation ΔE · Δt ≥¯h is
valid for the measurement of the particle energy E
and the time duration Δt of this measurement. The
energy of an excited atomic state with mean life-
time τ can only be measured with an uncertainty
ΔE = ¯h/τ.
•
Bohr’s classical atomic model, where the elec-
trons orbit around the nucleus on circles like
planets around the sun, needs an additional quan-
tum condition in order to explain the discrete
energy levels of the atom. The condition for the ra-
dius r of the orbit can be formulated as 2πr = nλ,
where λ = h/p is the de Broglie wavelength of
the electron’s matter wave, or as the quantization
|l| = rp = nh of the angular momentum l of the
electron. Both conditions are equivalent and lead
to a quantization of the energy levels.
•
The allowed energy levels of atoms or ions
with only one electron and nuclear charge
Ze are
En = −Ry∗Z2/n2
(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) ,
where Ry∗= μe4/
"

0h2#
is the Rydberg con-
stant for the system consisting of the nucleus and
the electron with reduced mass μ in the center of
mass system.
•
Bohr’s model predicts many features of atomic
spectra correctly, but has to be modiﬁed on some
essential points.
•
The uncertainty relation explains the stability of
atomic ground states.
•
All excited atomic states Ek are unstable. They
decay under emission of a photon hν = Ek −Ei
into lower states Ei.
•
The quantization of atomic energy levels is cor-
roborated by the results of the Franck–Hertz ex-
periment and by the observation of line spectra in
absorption and emission of atoms.
•
The quantum mechanical description replaces
the exactly determined path of a microparti-
cle by a probability distribution |ψ(x, t)|2 of
a wave packet. This distribution spreads in
time. The uncertainty Δx becomes the larger
the more accurate the initial location x(t0) had
been known.
•
The interference phenomena observed for mat-
ter waves in interference experiments, where the
matter wave is split and later recombined, are
due to the imperfect knowledge of which path
the particle has taken. The ﬁnal state of the
particle therefore has to be described by a lin-
ear combination of two or more wave functions.
If the path of the particle is deﬁned by addi-
tional experiments the interference pattern disap-
pears, because now the linear combination can
be reduced to one of the terms in the linear
combination.

4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
In Chap. 3 we saw that because of the uncertainty rela-
tion, the location x and the momentum px of an atom
cannot be simultaneously measured exactly. The clas-
sical well-deﬁned path r(t) of a particle moving with
velocity v(t) has to be replaced by the probability
P(x, y, z, t) dV = |ψ(x, y, z, t)|2 dV
(4.1)
of ﬁnding a particle at a given time t in the volume dV
around the point r = {x, y, z}. The probability densi-
ty is determined by the absolute square of the wave
function ψ.
In this chapter we will demonstrate, using sever-
al simple examples, how the wave function ψ can be
obtained. These examples also illustrate the physical
ideas behind the mathematical framework of quantum
mechanics and their differences from classical con-
cepts. They furthermore show under which conditions
the quantum mechanical results converge to the classi-
cal ones and they demonstrate that classical mechanics
represent the correct theory for all situations where
the de Broglie wavelength λdB approaches zero (this
is nearly always the case in daily life phenomena).
We will also see that most of the quantum me-
chanical phenomena are well known in classical optics.
This means that the essential new concept of quan-
tum mechanics is the description of classical particles
by matter waves, where the de Broglie wavelength
λdB = h/(mv) gives the minimum spatial uncertainty
range when the momentum p = mv is known within
Δp = ±¯h/λdB = ±mv/2π. The deterministic classi-
cal model of the time-dependent location (r(t), p(t)) of
a particle in phase space is replaced by a statistical de-
scription, where only probabilities can be given for the
result of a measurement. There is a principal uncertain-
ty for the simultaneous determination of location and
momentum of a particle, which cannot be overcome
even with sophisticated measuring techniques.
4.1 The Schrödinger Equation
In this section we will discuss the basic equation of
quantum mechanics that was introduced in 1926 by
Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) (Fig. 4.1). The soluti-
ons of this equation are the wave functions ψ(x, y, z, t)

4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
we are looking for. They can be obtained, in analytical
form, only for a few simple problems. For real and
therefore more complex situations the solutions have
to be calculated numerically. However, with present
day computing power, this generally poses no major
problems.
Although the Schrödinger equation cannot be
derived in a direct mathematical way, it is possible to
show how Schrödinger arrived at this equation from
classical wave concepts if the description of particles
by matter waves is accepted.
We regard a freeparticle with mass m moving with
uniform velocity v in the x direction. With the re-
lations λ = h/p ⇒p = ¯hk and E = ¯hω = Ekin (be-
cause Epot = 0) we obtain, analogously to an optical
wave, the matter wave function
ψ(x, t) = Aei(kx−ωt) = Ae(i/¯h)(px−Ekint) ,
(4.2)
where Ekin = p2/2m is the kinetic energy of the parti-
cle. With the derivatives
∂2ψ
∂x2 = −p2
¯h2 ψ
and
∂2ψ
∂t2 = −ω2ψ = −E2
kin
¯h2 ψ
we obtain the wave equation
∂2ψ
∂x2 = 1
u2
∂2ψ
∂t2
(4.3)
for waves that propagate with the phase velocity u =
ω/k = E/p.
For stationary problems, where p and E do not ex-
plicitly depend on time, the wave function (4.2) can be
split into a product of a factor ψ(x) = Aeikx, which on-
ly depends on x (not on t) and a time-dependent phase
factor e−iωt. We can then write
ψ(x, t) = ψ(x)e−iωt .
(4.4)
Inserting (4.4) into the wave equation (4.3) yields,
for the space function ψ(x) with k2 = p2/¯h2 =
2mEkin/¯h2, the equation:
∂2ψ
∂x2 = −k2ψ = −2m
¯h2 Ekinψ .
(4.5)
For the case of a particle moving in the x direction in
an external ﬁeld with potential energy Epot, the particle
has the total energy E = Ekin + Epot. Replacing Ekin
in (4.5) by E −Epot we obtain the one-dimensional
Schrödinger equation for stationary situations:
−¯h2
2m
∂2ψ
∂x2 + Epotψ = Eψ .
(4.6a)
For the more general case of a particle moving in three-
dimensional space the wave equation (4.3) becomes
Δψ = 1
u2
∂2ψ
∂t2
with the Laplace operator
Δ = ∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2 + ∂2
∂z2 .
For
stationary
conditions,
the
wave
function
ψ(x, y, z, t) can be again split into a space de-
pendent factor and a phase factor Ψ (x, y, z, t) =
ψ(x, y, z)e−iωt, where ψ(x, y, z) is the solution of the
three dimensional stationary Schrödinger equation
−¯h2
2m Δψ + Epotψ = Eψ .
(4.6b)
For
time-dependent
problems
we
obtain
the
Schrödinger equation as follows: Taking the partial
derivative ∂ψ/∂t of (4.2) gives
∂ψ
∂t = −i
¯h Ekinψ .
(4.6c)
For a free particle with Epot = 0 is Ekin = E = const.
Inserting (4.6c) into (4.5) gives
i¯h ∂ψ(x, t)
∂t
= −¯h2
2m
∂2ψ(x, t)
∂x2
,
(4.7a)
which can be generalized for the three-dimensional
case to
i¯h ∂ψ(r, t)
∂t
= −¯h2
2m Δψ(r, t) .
(4.7b)
If the particle is moving in an external potential with
potential energy Epot(r), the general three-dimensional
time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:
i¯h ∂ψ(r, t)
∂t
= −¯h2
2m [Δψ(r, t) + Epot(r)] · ψ(r, t) .
(4.8)
Remarks
1. The “derivation” of the stationary Schrödinger
equation (4.6b) is based on the de Broglie relation
p = hk between momentum p of a particle and
wave vector k of the matter wave, which has been
proved by many experiments but cannot be derived
in a mathematical sense.

4.2. Some Examples
131
2. The stationary Schrödinger equation (4.6) repre-
sents the energy conservation Ekinψ + Epotψ =
Eψ in quantum mechanics. Just as the classical law
of energy conservation (ﬁrst law of thermodynam-
ics) it cannot be derived from ﬁrst principles but is
solely based on experimental experiences.
3. The Schrödinger equations (4.6) and (4.7) are lin-
ear equations. This means that with solutions ψ1
and ψ2 any linear combination c1ψ1 + c2ψ is also
a solution (superposition principle).
4. Since (4.7) is a complex equation, the wave func-
tions ψ may also be complex. However, the ab-
solute square |ψ|2 is always real, as it should be,
because it describes a physical quantity, namely the
spatial probability density of a particle.
5. There is an important difference compared to the
linear dispersion relation ω(k) = kc of electromag-
netic waves. For the matter wave of a particle with
energy E and momentum p, where E = p2/(2m),
the dispersion relation becomes a quadratic rela-
tion ω(k) = (¯h/2m)k2, where E = ¯hω and p = ¯hk.
Therefore the group velocity dω/dk = (¯h/m)k of
the matter wave depends on k (see Sect. 3.3.4).
For nonstationary problems (this means that energy
E = E(t) and momentum p = p(t) may be time de-
pendent) ∂2ψ/∂t2 can no longer be written as −ω2ψ
and (4.7b) cannot be derived from the wave func-
tion (4.2).
Schrödinger postulated that the generalized equa-
tion (4.8) for a particle moving in a time-dependent
external ﬁeld with potential energy E pot(r, t) should
still be valid for this more general case.
Although there is no mathematical proof for
this postulate, numerous experiments have con-
ﬁrmed that the time-dependent Schrödinger
equation (4.8) is a correct description for all non-
relativistic phenomena observed so far. It is the
master equation of nonrelativistic quantum me-
chanics and all phenomena in this ﬁeld can be (at
least numerically) calculated by this equation.
For stationary problems the wave function ψ(r, t)
can be separated into
ψ(r, t) = ψ(r)e−i(E/¯h)t .
Inserting this product into (4.8) again yields the sta-
tionary Schrödinger equation (4.6a) for the spatial part
ψ(r).
Note:
The solutions of the time-independent Schrödinger-
equation describe stationary problems. If moving par-
ticles or time-dependent processes are described, these
solutions represent time averages over time-dependent
processes. In order to gain more insight into the dy-
namics of such processes one can either use the time-
dependent Schrödinger equation (which often demands
extensive computer programs), or semi-classical mod-
els which often can give more insight into the physics
of the problem. In this textbook we will use the sec-
ond choice in order to give the reader a feeling of the
physical essence of a problem.
4.2 Some Examples
In this section we will demonstrate the application of
the Schrödinger equation (4.6) to some simple one-
dimensional problems. These examples shall illustrate
the wave description of particles and its physical con-
sequences.
4.2.1 The Free Particle
A particle is called a free particle when it moves or rests
in a constant homogeneous potential Epot = const.
Because F = −grad Epot = 0 there is no force acting
on the particle. We can choose this constant potential
energy as Epot = 0 without restricting the generality
of the problem. From (4.6) we obtain the Schrödinger
equation of the free particle:
−¯h2
2m
d2ψ(x)
dx2
= Eψ(x) .
(4.9a)
The total energy E = Ekin + Epot is now, because
Epot = 0,
E = p2
2m = ¯h2k2
2m .
And (4.9a) reduces to
d2ψ
dx2 = −k2ψ .
(4.9b)
With the general solution
ψ(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx
the time-dependent wave function
ψ(x, t) = ψ(x)e−iωt = Aei(kx−ωt) + Be−i(kx+ωt)
(4.9c)

4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
represents the superposition of a plane wave traveling
into the +x direction and a wave into the −x direction.
The coefﬁcients A and B are the amplitudes of these
waves, which can be determined from the boundary
conditions. If, for example, the wave function shall de-
scribe electrons that are emitted from a cathode and ﬂy
into +x direction to the detector, the coefﬁcient B must
be zero. From the experimental setup we know that the
electrons can only be found within the distance L be-
tween cathode and detector (Fig. 4.2). This implies that
the amplitude A can be nonzero only for 0 < x < L.
With the normalization condition
L

0
|ψ(x)|2 dx = 1
⇒
A2L = 1
(4.10)
we obtain for the amplitude A = 1/
√
L.
Note:
In order to deﬁne the location of a particle at time t
more precisely, we have to use wave packets instead of
the plane waves (4.21) for its description:
ψ(x, t) =
k0+Δk/2

k0−Δk/2
A(k)ei(kx−ωt) dk
(4.11b)
(see Sect. 3.3.1).
The local uncertainty Δx ≥¯h/(Δpx) = 1/(Δk) at
time t = 0 depends on the momentum uncertainty
Δpx = ¯hΔk (Fig. 3.31). The larger the uncertainty Δk
the smaller the uncertainty Δx (t = 0), however, the
faster the wave packet spreads for t > 0.
This can be nicely illustrated by our example in
Fig. 4.2. If we apply a short voltage pulse between the
cathode K and the anode A at t = 0, electrons can start
moving from K through the grid A to the detector D

Fig. 4.2. Illustration of the spread of the wave packet by
observing a bunch of electrons emitted at t = 0 from the
cathode with velocity spread Δv(t = 0)
only during the pulse. Due to the thermal velocity dis-
tribution of the electrons emitted from the hot cathode
their velocities are spread over the interval Δv ∝Δk.
Electrons with different values of v emitted at t = 0
are “smeared out” over the interval Δx at later times t.
The uncertainty Δx increases with time according to
d
dt (Δx(t)) = Δv(t) = ¯h
m Δk(t) ∝Δp(t = 0)
m
.
The spatial spread of the wave packet is proportional to
its initial spread of momentum.
Note:
The following examples are mainly concerned with
moving particles which have to be correctly described
by wave packets. However, the essential features can
be already seen when the particles are represented by
the spatial part of (4.4), i.e. by stationary wave func-
tions. The treatment by wave packets gives much more
complex results because time-dependent interference
effects complicate the spatial structure of the wave
packet.
4.2.2 Potential Barrier
We divide the total x range into two parts (Fig. 4.3).
For x < 0 the potential energy is zero, while for x ≥0
Epot = E0 ̸= 0. At x = 0 we have a step ΔEpot = E0
of the potential energy. From the left side of Fig. 4.3
free particles with energy E ﬂy into the +x direction.
We describe them, as in (4.10), by the wave function
ψI(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx ,
(4.11)
where B is the amplitude of the wave functions for
particles reﬂected at the potential barrier and traveling
in the −x direction. Note, that only the spatial part of
the wave function is written in (4.11), the time depen-
dent part is here omitted because we are dealing here

with stationary problems. The complete wave function
is represented by (4.9c).
For x ≥0 the Schrödinger equation is
d2ψ
dx2 + 2m
¯h2 (E −E0)ψ = 0 .
(4.12a)
With the abbreviation α = √2m(E0 −E)/¯h this re-
duces to
d2ψ
dx2 −α2ψ = 0 .
(4.12b)
The solutions of (4.12b) are
ψII = (x ≥0) = Ceαx + De−αx .
(4.13)
Since the total wave function
ψ(x) =
/
ψI
for
x < 0
ψII
for
x ≥0
has to be uniquely deﬁned within the whole range
−∞≤+∞, the derivative dψ/dx must be a contin-
uous function and has to be ﬁnite within this range.
Otherwise, the second derivative in (4.12b) would not
be deﬁned and (4.12) could not be applied.
This gives the following boundary conditions for
x = 0:
ψI(x = 0) = ψII(x = 0)
⇒
A + B = C + D

(4.14b)
We distinguish the two situations where the energy
Ekin = E of the incident particles is smaller (E < E0)
or larger (E > E0) than the potential step (Fig. 4.3).
a) E<E0:
In this case α = √2m(E0 −E)/¯h > 0 is real and the
coefﬁcient C in (4.13) has to be zero. Otherwise ψII(x)
becomes inﬁnite for x →∞and could no longer be
normalized. With (4.14) we then obtain:
B = ik + α
ik −α A
and
D =
2ik
ik −α A .
(4.15)
The wave function in the region x < 0 is then
ψI(x) = A

eikx + ik + α

)

(4.16)
This means that all particles are reﬂected.
This would also be expected from classical mechan-
ics. Since the particles do not have sufﬁcient energy,
they cannot reach the region x > 0.
However, there is an important difference in the
wave description:
The particles are not reﬂected exactly at x = 0
but penetrate into the region x > 0 before they
return to the −x direction.
This can be seen from closer inspection of ψII. The
probability of ﬁnding a particle at x ≥0 is
P(x) = |ψII(x)|2 =

Particles with energy E, described by matter
waves can penetrate into regions with poten-
tial energy E0 > E, where they would not be
allowed in classical particle mechanics.
However, if we accept the wave description of par-
ticles the result, which is surprising at a ﬁrst glance,
follows quite naturally and completely analogously to
the well-known phenomena of total reﬂection in wave
optics. If a light wave traveling in a medium with

134
4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
refractive index n is incident on the boundary plane to
a second medium with refractive index n′ < n, under
an angle θ less than the critical angle θc it is total-
ly reﬂected for n sin θ > n′. The wave, however, still
penetrates into the second medium with a penetration
depth
xp = 1
kγ
with
γ =
$
n2 sin2 θ −n′2 .
This shows that quite analogous formulas are obtained
for both cases if 2α is replaced by kγ .
b) E>E0
Now the kinetic energy Ekin = E of the incident par-
ticles is larger than the potential barrier E0. In the
classical particle model, all particles would travel into
the region x ≥0, while their kinetic energy Ekin(x ≥
0) = E −E0 would become smaller (Fig. 4.5).
What does the wave model say?
The quantity α in (4.12b) is now purely imaginary
and we replace it by the real quantity
k′ = iα =
$
2m(E −E0)/¯h .
(4.18)
The solutions for ψI(x) are again (4.11) and for ψII(x)
we obtain instead of (4.13) for x ≥0
ψII(x) = Ce−ik′x + Deik′x .
(4.19a)
Since for x > 0 no particles travel in the −x direction,
the amplitude C has to be zero and we obtain
ψII(x) = De−ik′x .

From the boundary conditions (4.14) we deduce that

The wave functions ψI and ψII then become:

|k + k′|2
(4.23)
gives the fraction of the ﬂuxes of transmitted parti-
cles (Fig. 4.5). Here the different velocities v and v′
in both regions have to be taken into account. Since
D2 gives the spatial density of transmitted particles, the
ﬂux is v′D2.
From (4.22) and (4.23) it follows that R + T = 1
(conservation of the particle number!)

k′ = √2mE0(E/E0 −1)/¯h.
For E = E0 ⇒k′ = 0 and T = 0; R = 1. All par-
ticles are reﬂected.
Remarks
1. Instead of the positive potential step a negative step
with E0 < 0 can also occur. This can be realized
when in Fig. 4.3 the particles enter from the right
side, i.e., all k-vectors are inverted.
2. Since in optics the wave number k = 2π/λ is relat-
ed to the refractive index n by k = nk0, (4.22) can
be directly converted to
R =
****
n1 −n2
n1 + n2

,
which gives the optical reﬂection coefﬁcient for
a boundary plane between two media with refrac-
tive indices n1 and n2. This again shows the close
relationship between wave optics and matter wave
description.

4.2.3 Tunnel Effect
We will now consider the case of a potential barri-
er with ﬁnite width Δx = a (Fig. 4.7). We therefore
divide the whole x range into three sections:
I :
x < 0 ,
Epot = 0
II :
0 ≤x ≤a ,
Epot = E0
III :
x > a ,
Epot = 0 .
The wave functions are similar to the discussion in the
previous section:
ψI(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx ,
(4.24a)

The transmission of the matter wave (and therefore
of the particle represented by this matter wave as
well) through the potential barrier, depends on the
barrier heights E0, on the difference (E0 −E) and
exponentially on the product aα of barrier widths a
and coefﬁcient α = √2m(E0 −E)/¯h.

Fig. 4.8. Illustration of the tunnel effect for a potential barrier
of general shape
In the classical particle model, particles with E <
E0 could never overcome the barrier. The transmission
of matter waves through a potential barrier is called the
tunnel effect, because the particles seem to penetrate
the barrier at energy E on a horizontal path, as if this
were a tunnel. The potential barrier Ep(x) can have an
arbitrary form, as indicated in Fig. 4.8. In our examples
we use rectangular barriers because the calculation of
transmission coefﬁcients is much simpler for this case.
EXAMPLE
E = E0/2 ,
a = λdB/2π = ¯h/p =
¯h
√2m(E0 −E) ⇒aα = 1 .
With sinh(1) = 1.543 we obtain from (4.26a):
T =
0.5
0.5 + 0.5 · 1.5432 = 0.3 .
This means that 30% of all incident particles can
transmit through the barrier.
If a = λdB ⇒aα = 2π. With sinh2(2π) = 7 ×
104 the transmission becomes T = 1.5 × 10−5.
In Fig. 4.9 the reﬂection coefﬁcient R and the trans-
mission T = 1 −R are plotted as a function of the
ratio E/E0 for the special case of a barrier with width
a = 0.48λdB(E0) that is about half of the de Broglie
wavelength λdB of the incident particles. The diagram
shows that even for E > E0 the transmission is smaller
than one, which means that not all of the incident par-
ticles pass the barrier, although they would do so in the
classical particle model.

For E > E0 the quantity α in (4.26) becomes imag-
inary. We, therefore, introduce the real quantity k′ =
iα = √2m(E −E0)/¯h. This transfers (4.26) into
T =
E/E0 −1
(E/E0 −1) + (E0/4E) sin2(k′a)

(4.26c)
This formula is completely analogous to the Airy-
formula in optics, which describes the transmission
of an electromagnetic wave through a glass plate. The
undulations of T in Fig. 4.9 are due to interferences
between the waves reﬂected at the front side and the
backside of the barrier. For k′a = mπ ⇒a = nλ/2,
destructive interference occurs, which results in R = 0
and T = 1 for E = E0 because in this case the de
Broglie wavelength λ′
dB = 2π/k′ becomes inﬁnite,
the parameter α therefore becomes zero and the trans-
mission is T = 1 independent of the width a of the
barrier (Fig. 4.10). This can be veriﬁed using the rule
of de-l’Hôspital, i.e., by differentiating the nominator
and denominator in (4.26c) with respect to E and then
inserting E = 0.
In classical wave optics the tunnel effect is a well-
known phenomenon. When a light wave is totally
reﬂected at the boundary plane between glass and
air (Fig. 4.11) the reﬂection coefﬁcient is R = 1 and
the detector D1 receives the full incident intensity. If,
however, a second glass plate is brought within a dis-
tance d parallel to the ﬁrst interface, part of the light is
transmitted to the detector D2. The transmission T can

The reason for this is that part of the light wave pen-
etrates through the ﬁrst interface and this evanescent
wave travels parallel to the interface plane. Its ampli-
tude decreases but the transmission through the inter-
face remains zero unless a second air-glass-interface is
brought within d ≈λ to the ﬁrst one.
The tunnel effect is, therefore, not a speciﬁc
quantum mechanical phenomenon (as is often
stated in text books), but occurs for all waves
(optical, acoustic or matter waves). The crucial
quantum mechanical aspect is the description of
classical particles by waves.
We will illustrate the tunnel effect, discussed so far
by a model barrier, for some real situations in atomic
and nuclear physics.

between electron and proton. If the atom is placed in
an external electric ﬁeld, E = {0, 0, Ez} in z direction,
an additional force F = −eE = −eEz ˆez is acting on
the electrons (Fig. 4.12). With z = r cos ϑ we obtain
for ϑ = 0 the z dependence of the potential
φ(z) = −

(4.28)
which has a maximum for [dφ/dz]zm = 0. This yields

The potential for zm becomes

The ionization energy is lowered by this amount. Due
to the tunnel effect the electron can escape even for
E < eφ(zm).
The energy level E3 in Fig. 4.12 would be stable in
a classical particle model but can decay by tunnel effect
in the quantum mechanical model, which describes the
electron by its matter wave.
b) Nuclear α-decay
The radioactive α-decay rate of instable radioactive nu-
clei is determined by the tunnel effect. The α-particle
(2 protons + 2 neutrons) is kept within the nucleus by

eled by the potential well in Fig. 4.13. Superimposed
on the attractive potential is the repulsive Coulomb-
potential due to the electrostatic repulsion between the
positively charged α-particle and the positive charge of
the nucleus. If the energy of the α-particle is above the
total potential energy at r →∞(E = Epot + Ekin >
Epot(∞)) the α-particle can tunnel through the po-
tential barrier and can leave the nucleus. The energy
difference ΔE = E(r0) −Epot(∞) appears as kinetic
energy of the emitted α-particle.
c) Inversion Tunneling in the NH3 Molecule
A famous example of the tunnel effect in molecular
physics is the NH3 molecule (Fig. 4.14). The poten-
tial energy Ep(z) of the N atom has two minima at
z = ±z0 above and below the plane of the three H
atoms, separated by a maximum at z = 0. Even if the
energy of the N atom vibrating against the three H
atoms is less than the potential energy Ep(z = 0), it can
tunnel through the potential barrier and has, therefore,
an equal probability of being at z = z0 or z = −z0.

(4.30)
In order to calculate the possible energies of the parti-
cle with mass m, we have to solve the one-dimensional
Schrödinger equation with the given boundary condi-
tions.
Within the interval 0 ≤x ≤a where Epot = 0 the
Schrödinger equation is
d2ψ
dx2 + k2ψ = 0
with
k2 = 2mE
¯h2
(4.31)
with the boundary condition ψ(x < 0) = ψ(x > a) =
0, since the particle cannot reach these x ranges.
We use, as we did in Sect. 4.2.2, the trial wave
functions
ψ(x) = Aeikx + Be−ikx
(4.32)
as possible solutions. The boundary condition ψ(x =
0) yields
A + B = 0
(4.33a)

4.2. Some Examples

while ψ(x = a) = 0 gives
Aeika + Be−ika = 0 .
(4.33b)
Because of (4.33a) this reduces to

the possible wave functions

The second boundary condition (4.33b) demands
2iA sin(ka) = 0 ⇒ka = nπ
(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .) .

The energies are quantized. Not every energy is pos-
sible but only discrete values En, which increase as n2
and are proportional to 1/a2. This means that the larg-
er the width a of the potential well is, the smaller the
eigenenergies (Fig. 4.17a,b).
The minimum energy is not zero but
E1 = ¯h2

(4.38)
This zero-point energy is caused by restricting
the location x of the particle to Δx = a. The
larger Δx the smaller is the zero-point energy.

relation that demands
ΔpΔx ≥h/2 .

For the minimum wave number we obtain:

(4.40)
EXAMPLE
For an electron in a potential well with a = 1 nm the
energy values are
En = ¯h2π2
2mea2 n2 = 0.368 eV · n2 .
The excitation of the electron from its lowest state E1
to the ﬁrst excited state E2 demands the energy ΔE =
E2 −E1 = 3 · 0.368 eV = 1.1 eV.
Remarks
1. When the walls of the potential box have a ﬁnite
height E0 the particle can partly penetrate into these
walls, as was shown in Sect. 4.2.2. Its wave function
decays inside the walls exponentially (Fig. 4.18).
The wave functions slightly change because the
boundary conditions ψ(0) = 0 and ψ(a) = 0 are no
longer valid. The energies En decrease. As is out-
lined in Problem 4.4 the energies En can be numer-
ically calculated from the transcendent equations
kn tan(kna/2) = α

2. Energies E > E0 are not quantized, since the par-
ticle is now no longer restricted to the interval 0 ≤
x ≤a. A particle with E > E0 traveling into the
x direction traverses the potential well, however,
not with the transmission probability T = 1. Part
of its matter wave is reﬂected, as has already been
discussed in Sect. 4.2.2.
3. Up to now we have described the particle by its mat-
ter wave with a well- deﬁned k-value. In Sect. 3.3
we have, however, learned that the adequate de-
scription is a wave packet that contains many dif-
ferent k-values within the interval k0 −Δk/2 ≤
k + Δk/2. While the solutions (4.35) describe the
stationary time-averaged situation of a particle in
a one-dimensional box, the time-dependent descrip-
tion of a particle moving back and forth in the
box has to be performed with wave packets. Here
the interference pattern is much more complex,
because many different wavelengths of the wave
packet contribute to it. An impression of the time-
dependent description gives the colored picture 1 in
the Appendix.
4. If the energy scale in Fig. 4.18 is shifted in such
a way that
Epot =
/
−E0
for
0 ≤x ≤a
0
elsewhere
all formulas in Sect. 4.2.3 can still be used if E0
is replaced by −E0. Since E > −E0, the trans-
mission T is now obtained from (4.26c), but with
a different value of k′
k′ =
$
2m(E + E0)/¯h .
At energies En = ¯h2k2
n/2m with kn = nπ/a the
transmission shows maxima. This phenomenon,
caused by interferences between waves reﬂected at
the front and backside of the potential can be al-
so observed for more general (i.e., non-square well)
potentials. For instance, the scattering cross section
of particles scattered by other atoms in a gas shows
minima for energies of the incident particle when
destructive interference occurs for the deﬂected de
Broglie waves (Ramsauer effect).

4.2.5 Harmonic Oscillator
A very famous example of one-dimensional problems
is the harmonic oscillator, which plays an important
role in many branches of physics, such as molecu-
lar physics, solid-state physics and nuclear physics. If
a particle moves in a parabolic potential with poten-
tial energy Epot = 1
2 Dx2 the restoring force is F =
−grad Epot = −Dx. The classical description uses
a point mass m, that is attached to a spring with restor-
ing force F = −Dx (Hook’s law) (Fig. 4.19). If the
point mass is removed from its equilibrium position at
x = 0 and then released it performs harmonic oscilla-
tions x = A sin(ωt) or x = A cos(ωt) depending on the
initial conditions. The frequency of these oscillations is
ω =
$
D/m ⇒D = mω2 .
(4.42)
It depends on the mass m and the restoring force
constant D of the spring.
The quantum mechanical treatment starts from the
Schrödinger equation (4.6a), which now becomes:
−¯h2

(4.44a)
Using the transformation of the variable x to

(4.45)
and the abbreviation
C = 2E
¯hω
we obtain from (4.44a) the Schrödinger equation in the
form
d2ψ
dξ2 + (C −ξ2)ψ = 0 .
(4.44b)
For the special case C = 1

E = 1
2 ¯hω

the solution
of (4.44b) is:
ψ0(ξ) = Ae−ξ2/2
(4.46a)
as can be readily veriﬁed by inserting (4.46a) in-
to (4.44b). We now make the more general ansatz:
ψ(ξ) = H(ξ)e−ξ2/2 .
(4.46b)
Inserting this into (4.44b) yields the equation
d2H
dξ2 −2ξ dH
dξ + (C −1)H = 0
(4.47)
for the function H(ξ). This is a Hermitian differential
equation, well known to mathematicians. Its solutions
are the Hermitian polynomials Hv(ξ) of order v, which
are deﬁned by the generation equation
Hv(ξ) = (−1)veξ2 dv
dξv

(4.48)
with v = 0, 1, 2, . . ., as can be veriﬁed by insert-
ing (4.48) into (4.47). The Hermitian polynomials can
be found in mathematical tables. The eigenfunctions
ψ(ξ) in (4.46b) for the ﬁrst four polynomials Hv with
v = 0, 1, 2 and 3 are listed in Table 4.1, where the Ni
are normalization factors, which ensure that

(4.51)
with ˜H(x) = Nv · H(x) where Nv =
4
m · Ev/¯h2 is a
normalization factor.
Inserting (4.50) into (4.47) and comparing the coef-
ﬁcients of equal powers ξi yields the recursion formula
(i + 2)(i + 1)ai+2 = [2i −(C −1)] ai .
(4.52)
Assume that ξv is the highest power of ξi, then av+2
has to be zero. From (4.52) we can, therefore, conclude
(2v −C + 1) = 0 ⇒v = 1
2(C −1) .

Since C = 2E/¯hω we obtain the relation between the
“quantum numbers” v and the energy values

potential (harmonic oscillator)
The normalized wave functions of the harmonic
oscillator are
ψ(x) = ˜H(x)e−(mEv/¯h2)x2 .
(4.56)
They are depicted in Fig. 4.20 for v = 0, 1, 2, 3 togeth-
er with their absolute squares |ψ|2 dx, which give the
probability to ﬁnd the particle in the interval dx around
the position x.
In classical physics, the probability of ﬁnding the
particle during the time interval dt within the spatial
interval dx during the harmonic oscillation with period
T = 2π/ω is
P(t) dt = dt
T =
dx
v(x)T ,
(4.57)
where dt = dx/v(x) is the time interval the particle
needs to traverse the spatial interval dx. Since the
velocity v(x) = dx/dt becomes zero at the two turn-
ing points of the oscillation, the probability P(x) has
maxima at these points (Fig. 4.21).
Also the quantum mechanical description yields,
for v > 0, maxima around the turning points, but has
an oscillatory probability P(x) dx of ﬁnding the par-
ticle in the interval dx around x. For large quantum
numbers v the classical description (dashed curve in
Fig. 4.21, shown for v = 10.) represents the average of
the quantum mechanical probability |ψ|2 dx.

quantum mechanical probabilities for a particle with high
vibrational quantum number (here v = 10) of the harmonic
oscillator. The abscissa is plotted in units of ξ = x√mω/¯h
For the lowest state v = 0, both descriptions dif-
fer considerably. The quantum mechanical probabil-
ity has a Gaussian distribution with its maximum
at x = 0, whereas the classical description assumes
a particle at rest and the probability would there-
fore be a delta function at x = 0. The classical model
gives the lowest energy as E0 = 0, while the quan-
tum mechanical model yields the zero-point ener-
gy E0 = ¯hω/2, which is justiﬁed by the uncertainty
relation.
All experiments performed so far (see Chap. 11)
have proven that the quantum mechanical model of the
harmonic oscillator is the correct description.
Remark
The quantities |ψ|2 dx in (4.39) give the probabilities
of ﬁnding the particle within the interval dx only for
the stationary case. This case is relevant if the ener-
gies En are measured with a low time resolution, which
means that the measuring interval Δt is large com-
pared to the vibrational period T of the oscillator. For
measurements with a very high time resolution, the
dynamics of the vibrating particle can be resolved. In
this case the stationary wave description is no longer
adequate, but wave packets must be used in order to lo-
calize the particle better during its vibration (Fig. 4.22).

Fig. 4.22. Two momentary pictures of a wave packet oscil-
lating back and forth in the harmonic potential. The wave
packet is composed here of four vibrational wave functions
of levels v to v + 3
The wave packets are composed of the superposi-
tion of several vibrational wave functions within the
energy interval ΔE = ¯h/Δt, where Δt is the time res-
olution of the experiment. The wave packets move
back and forth between the potential walls. This wave
packet description comes closer to the classical model
(see Chap. 11).
EXAMPLE
The vibration period of a vibrating molecule depends
on the mass and the restoring force (i.e., the potential
coefﬁcient D in (4.30)). For Na2 molecules T = 2 ×
10−13 s, for N2 molecules T = 1.4 × 10−14 s and for
the light hydrogen molecule H2 the vibrational period
is only T = 7.6 × 10−15 s.
In order to measure the dynamics of a vibrating
molecule a time resolution in the femtosecond range
(1 fs = 10−15 s) is necessary.
If the wave packet should have a spatial resolu-
tion Δx corresponding to a resolved time interval Δt
that is small compared with the vibrational period T ,
then its energy resolution ΔE > h/Δt becomes worse.
For instance, if Δt = 0.2 T than ΔE is about ﬁve times
as large as the energy separation ΔEvib = En+1 −En.
This means that ﬁve vibrational levels are simultane-
ously involved in the oscillation. The superposition

144
4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
of the wave functions (including their time factor
exp(iωnt)) of these ﬁve levels determines the form of
the wave packet, which oscillates, like the classical par-
ticle, between the turning points within the harmonic
potential (Fig. 4.22).
The discrepancy between the oscillating classical
particle and the stationary wave functions is, there-
fore, somewhat artiﬁcial and does not represent a real
problem. The stationary wave functions describe the
time-averaged motion of the particle with the time-
independent total energy, while the wave packet model
describes the dynamics of the particle, it separates the
kinetic energy (determined by the group velocity of the
wave packet) and the potential energy. Both energies
change during the oscillation, while the total energy
remains constant.
4.3 Two-and Three-Dimensional
Problems
For the solution of two- or three-dimensional prob-
lems we have to start from the three dimensional
Schrödinger equation (4.6b)

(4.58)
with the Laplace operator in Cartesian coordinates
Δψ = ∂2ψ
∂x2 + ∂2ψ
∂y2 + ∂2ψ
∂z2 .
(4.59)
The solutions ψ = ψ(x, y, z) can be obtained analyt-
ically only for potentials with high symmetry. For all
other cases the Schrödinger equation has to be solved
numerically. We will start with the more simple case of
a two-dimensional potential box.

levels within a given energy interval is, therefore, much
larger than in the one-dimensional case (Fig. 4.24).
It may happen, that two different combinations
(nx, ny) result in the same energy. For example for the
quadratic potential box with a = b the two conﬁgu-
rations with (nx = 7, ny = 1) and (nx = ny = 5) both
have the same energy E = 50E1, although their wave
functions differ completely (see Fig. 4.25). Such states
with different wave functions, but with the same energy
are called degenerate.
The absolute squares |ψ(x, y)|2 of the wave func-
tions represent the probability to ﬁnd the particle at
the position (x, y) in the energy state E(nx, ny). For
degenerate states different spatial distributions of this
probability give the same energy value.

4.3.2 Particle in a Spherically Symmetric Potential
For a potential with spherical symmetry the solutions
of the Schrödinger equation are easier to obtain when
we use spherical coordinates (r, ϑ, ϕ) instead of the
Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). The relations between
the two sets of coordinates (Fig. 4.26) is given by
x = r sin ϑ cos ϕ
y = r sin ϑ sin ϕ
z = r cos ϑ

(4.71)
Now we draw an important conclusion:
The left side of (4.71) solely depends on r and ϑ,
the right side solely on ϕ. Since the equation has to
be valid for all values of r, ϑ, and ϕ it follows that
both sides have to be equal to a constant C1 (prove this
statement!). For the right side of the equation this gives

(4.73)
The function "(ϕ) has to be uniquely deﬁned for all
possible values of ϕ. This results in the condition
"(ϕ) = "(ϕ + n2π)
⇒e±√C12nπ = 1 ⇒
$
C1 = m
with
m = integer ,
(4.74)
which means that m must be a positive or negative
integer. The solutions "(ϕ) are then:
"m(ϕ) = Aeimϕ .

We will normalize them in such a way that

This gives the normalized functions

They are orthogonal because

Now we will determine the solutions Θ(ϑ). We di-
vide both sides of (4.71) that equal the constant C1 =
m2 by sin2 ϑ and rearrange the different terms in such
a way that only terms that solely depend on ϑ remain
on the right side, while on the left side only terms
depending on r remain. This yields:

Remark
Unfortunately the symbol m in eqation (4.76) is used
for two different quantities. On the left side it repre-
sents the mass of the particle and on the right side the
integer m = √C1. Since in most of the literature, the
symbol m is used for the magnetic quantum number
m = √C1 (see later) we did not want to depart from
this common nomenclature.

+ C2! = 0 .
(4.78)
The solutions can be written as the power series
! = a0 + a1ξ + a2ξ2 + . . . .
(4.79)
Since the function !(ϑ) must also be ﬁnite for ξ = ±1,
i.e., for ϑ = 0◦and ϑ = 180◦, the power series can
only have a limited number of terms.
Inserting (4.79) into (4.78) yields, when compar-
ing the coefﬁcients of equal powers of ξ the recursion
formula,
ak+2 = ak
k(k + 1) −C2
(k + 2)(k + 1) .
(4.80)
If the power series ends with the highest term alξl the
conditions al ̸= 0 but al+2 = 0 must be fulﬁlled. This
gives
C2 = l(l + 1)
l ∈N .
(4.81)
The real solutions
!l(ξ) = constPl(cos ϑ)
(4.82)
of Legendre’s equation (4.78) are named Legendre’s
polynomials. The boundary conditions demand:
!2(ϑ) = !2(ϑ + π) ⇒!(ϑ) = ±!(ϑ + π) .
Each of the functions represented by the power se-
ries (4.79) can therefore contain either even powers of ξ
only, or odd powers only.
b) m̸=0
For m ̸= 0 the solutions of equation (4.78) are the as-
sociated Legendre functions Pm
l (cos ϑ). As is shown in
mathematical textbooks, they can be obtained from the
Legendre’s polynomials
!l(ξ) = Pl(cos ϑ)
with
ξ = cos ϑ
by solving the equation
Pm
l (cos ϑ) = const(1 −ξ2)|m/2| d|m|
dξ|m| Pl(ξ) .
(4.83)
Since Pl(ξ) is represented by a power series up to the
highest power ξl, we see from (4.83) that the condition
|m| ≤l has to be fulﬁlled, otherwise the mth deriva-
tive would not be deﬁned. The integer numbers m can
be positive as well as negative. Therefore the range of
possible m-values is restricted to
−l ≤m ≤+l .

is the spherical symmetry of the potential. This means:
All spherical symmetric potentials have the same
angular part Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ) of the eigenfunctions
ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ).
The radial function R(r) in (4.70) can be deter-
mined from the left side of (4.76). Based on the
results (4.55) and (4.81) we obtain after multiplication
with R(r):

(4.88)
The solutions of (4.88) do depend on the radial de-
pendence of the potential Epot(r) and on the total
energy E. We will discuss these solutions for the case
of a Coulomb potential in the next chapter.
From (4.84) and (4.86) we can conclude that for
a given allowed energy E and a ﬁxed quantum number l
there are (2l + 1) different spherical harmonics Y m
l ,
because the energy does not depend on the quantum
number m which can be any integer number within the
interval
−l ≤m ≤+l .
(4.88x)
Remark
The separation (4.70) is possible only for spherical
symmetric potentials that do not depend on the an-
gles ϑ and ϕ. The spherical harmonics can, neverthe-
less, depend on ϑ and ϕ. This means that even for
a spherically symmetric potential the probability of
ﬁnding a particle generally depends on the angles and is
therefore not spherically symmetric! The spherical har-
monics are solutions for every potential with spherical
symmetry, independent of the radial form of this poten-
tial. In acoustics the functions Y m
l
describe the possible
deformations of the surface of a sphere caused by res-
onant standing acoustic waves within the sphere. They
are therefore also called spherical surface functions.
4.4 Expectation Values and Operators
For the statistical description of properties of a many
particle system one has to deﬁne average values, which
depend on the distribution of these properties over
the particles of the system. For example, the mean
velocity ¯v in a system of particles with velocity dis-
tribution f (v) is deﬁned by
¯v =
∞

v=0
vf (v) dv .
(4.88y)
The function f (v) dv gives the probability of ﬁnding
a particle within the interval v to v + dv. The mean
square velocity
v2 =
∞

v=0
v2 f (v) dv
(4.88z)
gives the average value of v2.
In quantum mechanics, the probability of ﬁnding
a particle within the interval from x to x + dx is given
by |ψ(x)|2 dx. The average value
⟨x⟩=
+∞

−∞
x|ψ(x)|2 dx
(4.89)
is called the expectation value for the location x of the
particle. The exact location in classical mechanics is re-
placed by a probability statement. The above deﬁnition
of the expectation value has the following meaning.
When we perform a series of measurements of the
location x of a particle, the result will be a distribution
of slightly different values x around the mean value
⟨x⟩=

ψ∗(x)xψ(x) dx .
This distribution is not caused by errors or inaccura-
cies of measurement, but by the fact that due to the
uncertainty relation Δx ≥h/Δp, it is in principle not
possible to measure the location x more accurately.
In an analogous way, we can deﬁne the expectation
value of the three dimensional radius vector
⟨r⟩=

ψ∗(r)rψ(r) dτ
=

x

y

z
ψ∗(x, y, z)rψ(x, y, z) dx dy dz .

4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
where the volume element dτ = dxdydz and the inte-
gral indicates the integration over all three dimensions.
The expectation value of a measurable quantity
of a particle is equal to its mean value ob-
tained from the wave function ψ of the particle
replacing the classical distribution function.
4.4.1 Operators and Eigenvalues
The general expectation value ⟨A⟩of a measurable
quantity A (called observable), is deﬁned as
⟨A⟩=

ψ∗ˆAψ dτ
(4.92)
where ˆA is the operator related to the observable A.
The operator ˆA performs a deﬁnite operation on the
wave function ψ. For example the operator ˆr corre-
sponding to the spatial coordinate r just multiplies the
wave function ψ with the radius vector r.
The expectation value of the kinetic energy can
be obtained from the Schrödinger equation, which
represents the quantum mechanical analogy to the
classical law of energy conservation Ekin + Epot = E.
From (4.6b) we see that
⟨Ekin⟩= −¯h2
2m

ψ∗Δψ dτ .
(4.93)
The operator of the kinetic energy of a particle
ˆEkin = −¯h2
2m Δ
(4.94)
causes the second derivative of the particle’s wave
function. Performing the ﬁrst derivative of the wave
function
ψ = Ae(i/¯h)( pr−Et)
(4.95)
with respect to x, y and z we obtain
−i¯h ∂
∂x ψ = pxψ ,
−i¯h ∂
∂y ψ = pyψ ,
and
−i¯h ∂
∂z ψ = pzψ .
(4.96)
This means that the operator of the particle’s momen-
tum can be expressed by
ˆp = −i¯h∇.
(4.97)
If A is a measurable physical quantity that is measured
N times, the measured values An will show deviations

⟨A⟩= 1
N

.
n=1
An
that are caused by the uncertainty ΔA of the observ-
able A. There may be additional deviations caused by
statistical or systematic errors of the measurement.
The deviations ΔA become zero, if the operator A
applied to the function ψ reproduces this function apart
from a constant factor A, i.e., if
ˆAψ = Aψ .
(4.98)
The function ψ is called an eigenfunction of the op-
erator ˆA and the constant A is the eigenvalue of the
operator ˆA. In this case we obtain for the expectation
value
⟨A⟩= A

ψ∗ψ dτ = A ,
(4.99)
which means that the expectation value of an opera-
tor ˆA formed with an eigenfunction ψ of this operator
equals the eigenvalue A that is well-deﬁned and has no
uncertainty.
This can be seen as follows. For eigenvalues we
have the relations

(4.101)
Here we have used the relation ⟨A ⟨A⟩⟩= ⟨A⟩2.

4.4. Expectation Values and Operators
151
This results means:
If the wave function ψ is eigenfunction of an op-
erator ˆA, then the mean quadratic deviation of an
observable A is zero. The system is in a state
where the quantity A is constant in time and
therefore the same value of A is obtained (apart
from measuring errors) when several measure-
ments are performed over the course of time.
Since A is a measurable quantity, it must be real. We
therefore only allow those operators for physical quan-
tities that have real eigenvalues and not complex ones.
This demand is fulﬁlled for all Hermitian operators.
Deﬁnition:
An operator is called Hermitian, if

ψ∗ˆAψ dτ =

ψ

ˆAψ
∗
dτ ,
(4.102)
where ψ∗is the conjugate complex of the func-
tion ψ.
If the operators ˆA and ˆB of two observables A
and B have the same eigenfunctions ψ, both quan-
tities A and B of a particle described by the wave
function ψ, can be measured simultaneously.
This can be seen as follows. From the relations
ˆAψ = Aψ
and
ˆBψ = Bψ
it follows that
ˆB ˆAψ = ˆB(Aψ) = A

ˆBψ

= ABψ
and
ˆA ˆBψ = ˆA(Bψ) = B

ˆAψ

= B Aψ .
Since A and B are real numbers which are commuta-
tive, i.e., AB = B A, we obtain

ˆA ˆB −ˆB ˆA

ψ = 0 ⇒ˆA ˆBψ = ˆB ˆAψ .
(4.103)
Two operators that fulﬁll the condition (4.103) are
called commutable.
If two operators are commutable their eigen-
values can be measured simultaneously with no
uncertainty (apart from measuring errors).
This will be illustrated by some examples.
We have seen from the discussion of the stationary
Schrödinger equation that the operator of the classical
kinetic energy Ekin = p2/2m of a particle is given in
quantum mechanics by the Laplace operator:
ˆEkin = −¯h2
2m Δ ,
(4.104)
which performs the second derivative operation on the
wave function.
The operator of the total energy E = Ekin + Epot is
the Hamiltonian operator
ˆH = ˆEkin + ˆEpot = −¯h2
2m Δ + Epot(r) ,
(4.105)
which is analogous to the classical Hamiltonian func-
tion and describes the total energy of stationary sys-
tems.
The total energy of a stationary state is the
eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian operator. The
Schrödinger equation (4.8) can be written as
Hψ = Eψ .
From (4.104) the operator of the momentum of
a particle follows as
ˆp = −i¯h∇
(4.106)
because the relation
ˆEkin = ˆp2
2m = −¯h2
2m ∇2 = −¯h2
2m Δ
can then be fulﬁlled.
The expectation value of the momentum is
⟨p⟩= −i¯h

ψ∗∇ψ dτ .
(4.107)
The x-components ˆpx of the momentum operator ˆp
and x of the operator ˆx are not commutable. This can
be readily seen as follows:
ˆx · ˆpx( f (x)) −ˆpx · ˆx( f (x))
= −ˆxi¯h ∂f
∂x + i¯h ∂
∂x (x f (x))

4. Basic Concepts of Quantum Mechanics
If
f (x) is an eigenfunction of
ˆx
it cannot be
an eigenfunction of
ˆpx. This means, that the ob-
servables x and
px
cannot be exactly measured
simultaneously.
We can now make the general statement:
To every measurable physical quantity we can re-
late a Hermitian operator, where the quantity is
the eigenvalue of this operator.
In Table 4.3 some physical quantities are listed
together with their corresponding operators.
Remark
The representations of the vector operator ˆr as the vec-
tor r and of the momentum operator ˆp as −i¯h∇are
useful if the wave functions are functions of the co-
ordinate r. There are physical situations (for example
in solid-state physics) where problems can be solved
easier when the wave functions ψ(r) are Fourier trans-
formed into functions "( p) of the momentum p, which
are deﬁned in momentum space. One example is the
eigenfunction
"( p) = ei( p/¯h)r
of the momentum operator ˆp.
One obtains the location pp in momentum space,
if the operator ˆpp = −i¯h∇p is applied to the func-
tion "( p). This yields
ˆpp" = pp" .
4.4.2 Angular Momentum in Quantum Mechanics
The classical deﬁnition of the angular momentum L of
a particle with mass m and velocity v with respect to
the origin r = 0 is
L = r × p = m(r × v) .
(4.108a)
With the deﬁnition of the momentum operator p =
−ih∇we obtain the operator of the angular momen-
tum
ˆL = −i¯h(r × ∇) .

tional to the spatial probability density of a particle in a
spherical symmetric potential, are plotted here in Cartesian
coordinates
This implies that the spherical harmonics (Fig. 4.28)
are eigenfunctions of the operator ˆL2.
We will prove this by applying ˆL2 to the wave
function ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) = R(r)Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ). With (4.111) we
obtain from (4.77), (4.81)
ˆL2ψ = ˆL2(R(r)Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ) = R(r) ˆL2Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ)
= R(r)l(l + 1)¯h2Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ) = l(l + 1)¯h2ψ .
(4.112a)
The expectation value of the square of the angular
momentum L is therefore

L2	
=

ψ∗ˆL2ψ dτ = l(l + 1)¯h2
(4.112b)
because the functions ψ are normalized.
The integer l is therefore named the angular mo-
mentum quantum number. For the absolute value of
the angular momentum we obtain from L2 = l(l +
1)¯h2:
|L| =
$
l(l + 1)¯h .
(4.112c)
For the z-component Lz we get, using (4.110),
ˆLzψ = −i¯h ∂
∂ϕ (R(r)Θ(ϑ)Φ(ϕ))
= −i¯hR(r)Θ(ϑ) ∂
∂ϕ eimϕ = m ¯hψ .
The eigenvalues of Lz are therefore
⟨Lz⟩= m ¯h .
(4.113)
where m is the projection quantum number of the
angular momentum. It is introduced in Sect. 4.3.2.
The two operators ˆLz and ˆL have the same eigen-
functions. They are, therefore, commutable and the
quantities Lz and L2 can be simultaneously measured.
If the operators ˆLx or ˆL y are applied to the func-
tion ψ, one can prove that ψ is not an eigenfunction
of ˆLx, i.e.,
ˆLxψ ̸= mxψ .

Historically the eigenfunctions with l = 0 are called
s-functions,
with
l = 1
p-functions,
with
l = 2
d-functions (see Table 4.4). The quantum number m
gives the orientation of the symmetry axis of these
functions against the z direction. If an external mag-
netic ﬁeld B = {0, 0, Bz} is applied, the quantum num-
ber m gives the projection of the angular momen-
tum L onto the ﬁeld direction. It is therefore called
the magnetic quantum number. Since m can take all
integer values in the interval −l ≤m ≤+l there are
2l + 1 different functions describing states with the
same energy in a spherical potential without mag-
netic ﬁeld. Sometimes it is useful to represent the
functions Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ) in Cartesian coordinates, for in-
stance to illustrate the orientation of chemical bonds
in molecules.
With

the representation of the Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ) in Table 4.2 trans-
forms into the Cartesian representation Y(x, y, z) in

While in classical mechanics the angular momentum
of a particle moving in a spherically symmetric poten-
tial is constant in time (because there is no torque on
the particle), which implies that the amount |L| and
all three components are constant and well deﬁned,
the quantum mechanical description gives a different
answer. The amount |L| and only one of the compo-
nents have a time-independent constant value, the two
other components cannot be measured simultaneous-
ly. Generally the z-axis is chosen as the preferential
direction (quantization axis), which means that thez-
component Lz is chosen as the component that can be
measured simultaneously with L2. With this conven-
tion we get:

In Fig. 4.29 this is illustrated by a vector model. The
length of the angular momentum L (blue vector) is
well deﬁned as is its projection onto the z-axis. The
two other components Lx and L y are not deﬁned. This
means in our vector model that the endpoint of the vec-
tor L can have any location on the dashed blue circle
(Fig. 4.30).
In summary
The operators L2 and Lz have common eigen-
functions. Their eigenvalues are simultaneous-
ly measurable. Lx and L y have no common
eigenfunctions with L2. Only the sum L2

|ψ(r, t)|2 describes the movement of the particle
in space. If Epot does not depend on time, the wave
functions
ψ(r, t) = ψ(r)ei(E/¯h)t

which is a solution of the stationary Schrödinger
equation, and a phase factor with an exponent
that depends on time and on the energy of the
particle.
•
A particle with energy E can tunnel through
a potential barrier of height E0, even if E < E0
(tunnel effect). The tunnel probability depends on
the difference E0 −E and on the width Δx of the

5. The Hydrogen Atom
Based on the discussions in Chap. 4 we will now ap-
ply the quantum mechanical treatment to the simplest
atom, the H atom, which consists of one proton and one
electron moving in the spherical symmetric Coulomb
potential of the proton. These one-electron systems,
such as the hydrogen atom and the ions He+, Li++,
Be+++, etc., are the only real systems for which the
Schrödinger equation can be exactly (i.e., analytically)
solved. For all other atoms or molecules approxima-
tions have to be made. Either the Schrödinger equation
for these systems can be solved numerically (which of-
fers a mathematical solution within the accuracy of the
computer program, but generally gives little insight in-
to the physical nature of the approximation), or the real
atoms are described by approximate models that can be
calculated analytically. In any case, for all multielec-
tron systems, one has to live with approximations, ei-
ther in the numerical solution of the exact atomic model
or for the exact solution of the approximate model.
A closer inspection of the spectrum of the hydrogen
atom and other atoms reveals, however, that at high-
er spectral resolution the lines show a substructure that
cannot be described by the Schrödinger theory, but is
due to new effects, such as ﬁne structure, hyperﬁne
structure or the anomalous Zeeman effect. Therefore,
even for the simple hydrogen atom the quantum me-
chanical model of an electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of
the proton has to be modiﬁed by introducing new prop-
erties of electron and proton, such as electron spin or
proton spin and their mutual interactions. These effects,
which are small compared to the Coulomb energy, are
included in a relativistic theory, based on the Dirac
equation, which is called quantum electrodynamics.
The Schrödinger equation can be regarded as the fun-
damental equation of nonrelativistic quantum theory.
The treatment of the hydrogen atom illustrates in
a very clear way the basic ideas of quantum mechanics,
it explains the physical interpretation of quantum
numbers, the description of the Zeeman effect and
the ﬁne structure by the model of angular momentum
vector couplings and gives a better understanding of
the more complex many-electron systems that will be
discussed in the next chapter.
5.1 Schrödinger Equation
for One-electron Systems
The Schrödinger equation for a system consisting of
one electron (mass m1, charge q = −e and radius vec-
tor r1) and a nucleus (mass m2 ≫m1, charge q =
+Ze and radius vector r2) is:
−¯h2
2m1
Δ1ψ −¯h2
2m2
Δ2ψ −Ze2
4πε0r ψ = Eψ(r1, r2) ,
(5.1)
where Δi is the Laplace operator with respect to ri. The
ﬁrst term describes the kinetic energy of the electron,
the second describes that of the nucleus and the third
one the potential energy of the Coulomb interaction
between the two particles, where r = |r1 −r2| is the
distance between the two particles. The wave function
Ψ (r1, r2) depends on the location of the electron and
nucleus, which means it depends on six coordinates.
5.1.1 Separation of the Center of Mass
and Relative Motion
In classical mechanics it is shown that the movement
of a closed system of particles can always be separated
into the motion of the center of mass and the relative
motion of the particles in the center- of-mass system.
This is also possible in quantum mechanics as can be
seen by the following derivation.

Fig. 5.1. Transformation of laboratory frame into the center-

We regard a system of two particles with coordi-
nates r1 = {x1, y1, z1} and r2 = {x2, y2, z2} written in
lower case letters and the coordinates of the center of
mass (written in capital letters) (Fig. 5.1)
R = m1r1 + m2r2
M
with
M = m1 + m2 ,
R = {X, Y, Z}
⃗ri = {xi, yi, zi}
With the relative distance r = {x, y, z} = |r1 −r2| =
|{x1 −x2, y1 −y2, z1 −z2}| we obtain from Fig. 5.1
the relations:
r1 = R + m2
M r ,
r2 = R −m1
M r .
(5.2)
In order to properly write the Schrödinger equa-
tion (5.1) in the coordinates r and R we have to
consider that the differentiation of the function #(r, R)
with respect to the variable xi (i = 1, 2) follows the
chain rule:

where ΔR is the Laplace operator for (X, Y, Z) and Δr
that for (x, y, z). We can abreviate (5.5) by T1 = T2 +
T3 + E.
The term T1 on the left side of (5.5) depends sole-
ly on the center-of-mass coordinates X, Y, Z. The two
other terms T2 and T3, on the right side, depend sole-
ly on the coordinates x, y, z. The total energy E of the
system is constant.
Now we draw the same conclusion as in Sect. 4.3.2:
Since equation (5.5) has to be valid for arbitrary values
of the coordinates X, Y, Z and x, y, z, both sides of the
equation have to be constant. This means T1 as well as
T2 + T3 have to be constant, otherwise (5.5) can not be

g(X, Y, Z) = Aei(kR−(Eg/¯h)t) .
With the de Broglie wavelength

,
which depends on the translational energy Eg of the
center-of-mass motion. The correct description of this
motion has to use wave packets (see Sect. 3.3.1–3.3.4).
The relative motion of electron and nucleus is de-
scribed by (5.7b). Renaming f (r) as ψ(r), E f as E
and Δr as Δ, we obtain the Schrödinger equation
−¯h2
2μΔψ + Epot(r)ψ = Eψ,
(5.8)
which is identical to the Schrödinger equation (4.40)
for a particle in a spherically symmetric potential if
the mass m of the particle is replaced by the reduced
mass μ = m1 · m2/(m1 + m2).
The Schrödinger equation of a one-electron atom
can be separated into a term describing the center
of mass and a second term that describes the po-
sition r of a particle with reduced mass μ relative
to that of the nucleus at r = 0 in a potential with
potential energy Epot.
In Sect. 4.3.2 we have already discussed the separa-
tion of this equation in spherical coordinates (r, ϑ, ϕ).
It was shown there that the wave function
ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) = R(r)Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ)
can be separated for arbitrary spherical potentials
into a radial function R(r) that depends on the r-
dependence of the potential and the angular part, which
equals the spherical functions Y m
l
independent of the
radial coordinate r.
In order to obtain the wave functions for the hy-
drogen atom we have to look for the radial wave
function for the Coulomb potential. Inserting this func-
tion into the Schrödinger equation yields the energy
eigenvalues E.
Note:
The function R(r) has nothing to do with the coordi-
nate R of the center of mass!
5.1.2 Solution of the Radial Equation
With the product-ansatz
ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) = R(r)Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ)
for the wave function #(r, ϑ, ϕ) in Sect. 4.3.2 we had
already obtained (4.65) for the radial part R(r), which
converts for m →μ and C2 = l(l + 1) into

The integer l describes, according to (4.89), the integer
quantum number of the orbital angular momentum of
the particle with respect to the origin r = 0 in our rel-
ative coordinate system, where the nucleus is at rest at
r = 0.
Differentiation of the ﬁrst term and introducing the

In the limit r →∞all terms with 1/r and 1/r2 in
the bracket approach zero and (5.10) becomes for this
limiting case:

(5.11)
The solutions of this equation describe the asymp-
totic behavior of the radial wave function R(r). The
probability of ﬁnding the electron in a spherical shell
with volume 4πr2 dr around the nucleus between the
radii r and r + dr is given by 4π|R|2r2dr. The ab-
solute square of the function r · R therefore gives the
probability of ﬁnding the electron within the unit vol-
ume of the spherical shell. We therefore introduce the
function W(r) = r · R(r) into (5.11). This yields, with
k = √2μE/¯h,

(5.12c)
For E > 0 k is real and the ﬁrst term in (5.12b)
represents the spatial part of an outgoing spherical
wave
ψ(r, t) = A
r ei(kr−ωt) ,
(5.12d)
which describes an electron that can, with a positive
total energy, leave the atom and can reach r →∞
(Fig. 5.2a). The second term corresponds to an incom-
ing spherical wave that represents an electron coming
from R = ∞and approaching the nucleus (this is
called a collision process).
For E < 0 we substitute κ = √−2μE/¯h = ik and
obtain the real asymptotic solutions
R(r →∞) = Ae−κr + Be+κr .
(5.12e)
Since R(r) must be ﬁnite for all values of r (otherwise
the function R(r) could not be normalized) it follows
that B = 0. We then obtain the asymptotic solution
R(r →∞) = Ae−κr .
This is an exponentially decreasing function which has
decayed to 1/e for r = 1/κ.
For the general solution, valid for all values of r, we
try the ansatz
R(r) = u(r)e−κr .
(5.12f)
Inserting this into (5.10) we obtain for u(r) the equation

The
reciprocal
value
r1 = 1/a = 4πε0 ¯h2/(μZe2)
gives, according to (3.85), the Bohr radius of the lowest
energy level.
We write u(r) as the power series
u(r) =

j
b jr j .
(5.14)
Inserting this into (5.13) the comparison of the co-
efﬁcients of equal powers in r yields the recursion
formula
b j = 2b j−1
κj −a
j( j + 1) −l(l + 1) .
(5.15)
Since R(r) must be ﬁnite for all values of r, the pow-
er series can only have a ﬁnite number of summands.
If the last nonvanishing coefﬁcient in the power se-
ries (5.14) is bn−1, then b j becomes zero for j = n.
This immediately gives, from (5.15), the condition that
only the coefﬁcients b j with j < n contribute to the
series (5.14).We therefore have the condition
j < n .
(5.16)
Since for j = n ⇒b j = 0 we obtain from (5.15)
a = nκ .

(5.18a)
Note that (5.18) is identical to eq. (3.88) of Bohr’s
model.
The quantum mechanical calculation of one-
electron systems gives the same energy values as
Bohr’s atomic model.
Note:
1. From the derivation of (5.18) it can be recognized
that the discrete eigenvalues En of possible energies
stem from the restraint ψ(r →∞) →0, which im-
plies that the electron is conﬁned within a ﬁnite
spatial volume (see also Sect. 4.2.4).
2. Besides the condition (5.18) for the energies there
is also a restraint for the angular momentum quan-
tum numbers l following from (5.15). According
to (4.59) l must be an integer. For the values j < n
that are allowed according to (5.16) the denomina-
tor in (5.15) would become zero for l = j, which
would result in an inﬁnite coefﬁcient b j. We there-
fore have to demand that in (5.15) all terms with
l ≥j must be zero in order to keep the function u(r)
ﬁnite.
We have then the condition
l < j < n,
which gives the restraint for the angular momentum
quantum number l
l ≤n −1 .
(5.19a)
The projection of the angular momentum ⃗l onto the
quantization axis (z-direction) is lz = m · ¯h with m =
−l, −l + 1, . . . . .l −1,l. There are 2l + 1 possible
m-values.
With the recursion formula (5.15) the functions u(r)
and with (5.12f) also the radial wave functions R(r)
can be calculated successively. Table 5.1 lists, for the
lowest values of n and l, the radial functions R(r). They
depend on n because of the condition (5.16) and on l
because of (5.15).

The energies En can be calculated from (5.18)
without the knowledge of the functions R(r). These
functions give, however, the radial electron distribution
and therefore the electric structure of the atom around
the nucleus. This will be discussed in more detail in the
following section.
5.1.3 Quantum Numbers and Wave Functions
of the H Atom
In the preceding section we have seen, that the energy
E(n,l) of an atomic state depends on certain quan-
tum numbers: The principal quantum number n and the
quantum number l of the orbital angular momentum.
The stationary wavefunctions, which describe the
time-averaged spatial distribution of the electron, are
also characterized by these quantum numbers and
in addition by the quantum number m of the z-
component lz = m ¯h of the orbital angular momentum
(see Sect. 4.4.2).
The normalized wave functions
ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) = Rn,l(r)Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ)
discussed in Sects. 4.3.2 and 5.1.2 are also called
atomic orbitals, because in the old Bohr-Sommerfeld
theory the electron was assumed to move on certain

orbitals around the nucleus. This expression is, howev-
er, misleading, because we know from the discussion in
Sect. 3.5 that we can not attribute to the electron a def-
inite path, but only a probability of ﬁnding it within
a volume dV, given by |ψ|2dV .
The normalized total wave functions ψ for the low-
est energy states of the hydrogen atom are compiled
in Table 5.2. They depend on the Quantum num-
bers n,l and m. This also means that the probability
of ﬁnding the electron at the position (r, ϑ, ϕ), i.e., the
spatial electron distribution depends on these quantum
numbers.
Each atomic state, described by its energy and its
spatial electron distribution is deﬁned uniquely
by the three quantum numbers n,l and m.
In Fig. 4.28 the spatial density distributions
**Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ)
**2 are illustrated for l = 0, 1, 2. The different
(l, m) states are labeled according to an international
convention with lower case Latin letters, as compiled in
Table 5.3. For example, a state with quantum numbers
n = 2, l = 1 is a 2p state, one with n = 4, l = 3 is a 4 f
state. The magnetic quantum number m is indicated by
a coordinate index, e.g. the 2p(m = 0) state is designat-
ed as 2pz, the 2p(m = ±1) by 2px on 2py, where the

Note: Often the nomenclature σ, π, δ . . . is reserved for
molecules (see Table 9.1). Since for atoms as well as for di-
atomic molecules this greek nomenclature gives the values of
the projection m ¯h, it is justiﬁed to use it for atoms as well
index gives the direction of the lobe of the p-function
(Fig. 4.27).
In Fig. 5.3 the radial wave functions of some atom-
ic states are illustrated. Together with the angular
part Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ), drawn in Fig. 4.24, the total wave func-
tions can be visualized, as shown for two examples in
Fig. 5.4, which represents the three-dimensional elec-
tron distribution in the Coulomb potential for the 2s
and the 2pσ state.
Since, according to (5.18), the energy En of an
atomic state depends in this model solely on n and not
on l or m, all states with possible combinations of l
and m for the same n have the same energy. For each
quantum number l there are 2l + 1 possible m values,
because −l ≤m ≤+l. The total number of different

(5.19b)
Different states with the same energy are called ener-
getically degenerate. The number of degenerate states
is called the degeneracy order. The states in the
Coulomb potential (e.g., for the H atom or the He+
ion) are n2-fold degenerate, which means that n2 states
with different quantum numbers l and m and therefore
different wave functions, but the same quantum num-
ber n all have the same energy (Fig. 5.5).
EXAMPLES
The state with the lowest energy (ground state) with
n = 1, l = 0, m = 0 is a nondegenerate 1s-state.
States with n = 2 may have angular momentum
quantum numbers l = 0, m = 0 (2s) or l = 1 and m =
0(2pz) and m = ±1 (2px,y). Such states are therefore
fourfold degenerate.
Note, that several effects (such as electron spin,
nuclear spins, external ﬁelds or the relativistic mass de-
pendence), which are not included in the Schrödinger
theory, may lift the degeneracy and split degenerate

5.1.4 Spatial Distributions and Expectation
Values of the Electron in Different
Quantum States
The spatial distribution of the electron in s states is
spherically symmetric. The electron has the angular
momentum
|l| =
$
l(l + 1)¯h = 0
in contrast to the Bohr-model, where the electron
moves on a circular path around the nucleus with an an-
gular momentum |l| = h. We can see from Table 5.2,
that the spatial probability density |ψ|(r, ϑ, ϕ)|2 in the
1s state has its maximum at r = 0, i.e, at the location
of the nucleus.
When we want to calculate the probability P(r)dr
to ﬁnd the electron within a spherical shell in a distance
between r and r + dr from the nucleus, independent of
the angles ϑ and ϕ, we have to solve the integral
P(r) dr =
π

ϑ=0
2π

ϕ=0
|ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ)|2r2 dr sin ϑ dϑ dϕ .
(5.20)
Inserting the wave function ψ for n = 1, l = 0 and
m = 0 (i.e., for the ground state of the hydrogen atom),
we obtain
P(r) dr = 4Z3
a3
0
r2e−2Zr/a0dr .
(5.21)
Comparing this with the wave function for the 1s state
we get the result:
The probability to ﬁnd the electron within the
distance r to r + dr from the nucleus is in the
1s state given by
P(r) dr = 4πr2|ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ)|2 dr .
Note:
Spherical symmetric electron distributions are obtained
for all s states with arbitrary quantum number n.
The function P(r) for n = 1 is maximum for rm =
a0/Z, as can be seen immediately by differentiation of
(5.21). For Z = 1 one obtains the Bohr-radius rm = a0
(the maximum probability of ﬁnding the electron is at
the Bohr-radius!). However, one should keep in mind
that the angular momentum obtained from the quantum
mechanical treatment is l = 0, while the Bohr mod-
el gives l = 1. All experiments performed so far have
conﬁrmed the quantum mechanical result.
If one would like to use a classical model for the
movement of the electron in the 1s state, one has to re-
place the circular path of the Bohr model by periodic
linear motions of the electron through the nucleus. The
direction of this oscillation is, however, randomly dis-
tributed, causing an average electron distribution that
is spherically symmetric (Fig. 5.6). Arnold Sommerfeld
(1868–1951) showed that the electron motion can be
described to proceed on very eccentric elliptical orbits
passing close to the nucleus, which causes a fast pre-
cession of the large axis and brings about that the outer
turning points are uniformly distributed on a spherical
surface.
The expectation value ⟨r⟩for the mean distance
between electron and nucleus is given by

These results are illustrated by the curves in Fig. 5.7.
In the simpliﬁed classical model this means that
the orbits with l =0 correspond to very eccentric el-
liptical paths where the electron is often close to the
nucleus, while orbits with maximum possible l are
close to circular orbits. With increasing principal quan-
tum number n the maximum possible values of l<n
become larger and the quantum mechanical spatial
probabilities approach more and more closely the clas-
sical circular orbits.
An interesting result arises:
Summing the spatial probability |ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ)|2 at
a given n over all allowed values of l and m
gives the total probability in the state n, which
is always spherically symmetric! Therefore the
sum over the electron distributions in all possi-
ble states (l, m) for a given value of n is called an
electron shell.
5.2 The Normal Zeeman Effect
We will now discuss the behavior of the H atom in
an external magnetic ﬁeld. In the beginning we will
use a semiclassical model (called the vector model),
where the electron motion is described by a classical
circular orbit, while the angular momentum is given by
the quantum mechanical expression
|l| =
$
l(l + 1)¯h .
An electron with charge −e moving with the velocity v
and the circular frequency ν = v/(2πr) on a circle with
radius r represents an electric current
I = −eν = −ev
2πr ,
(5.24)
which causes a magnetic moment
μ = I A = Iπr2 ˆn ,
(5.25)
where A = πr2 ˆn is the area vector perpendicular to the
plane of the motion (Fig. 5.8).
The angular momentum of the circulating electron
is
l = r × p = merv ˆn .
(5.26)
The comparison of (5.25) and (5.26) gives the relation
μ = −e
2me
l
(5.27)
between magnetic moment μ and angular momentum l
of the electron. Since μ is proportional to l, the orbital
magnetic moment is often labeled μl.
In an external magnetic ﬁeld the potential energy of
a magnetic dipole with magnetic moment μ is
Epot = −μ · B .
(5.28)
Using the relation (5.27) this can be expressed by the
angular momentum l as
Epot = + e
2me
l · B .
(5.29)
When the magnetic ﬁeld points into the z-direction
(B = {0, 0, Bz = B}), we obtain from (5.29), because
of lz = m ¯h,

bital angular momentum l and
magnetic moment μ

5.2. The Normal Zeeman Effect
169
Epot = e¯h
2me
mB ,
(5.30)
where m (which had been introduced before as the pro-
jection of l onto the z-axis) is called the magnetic quan-
tum number, that can take the values −l ≤m ≤+l.
The constant factor in (5.30)
μB = e¯h
2me
= 9.274015 × 10−24 J/T
(5.31)
is called the Bohr magneton.
We can now write the additional energy caused by
the magnetic ﬁeld as
ΔEm = μBmB ,
(5.32)
which gives for the energies of the hydrogen atomic
states in an external magnetic ﬁeld:
En,l,m = ECoul(n) + μBmB .
(5.33)
The 2l + 1 m-sublevels that are degenerate without
magnetic ﬁeld split into 2l + 1 equidistant Zeeman
components with energies between Emin
n
= ECoul(n) −
μBlB and Emax
n
= ECoul(n) + μBlB, with an energetic
distance (Fig. 5.9)
ΔE = En,l,m −En,l,m−1 = μBB ,
(5.34)
between adjacent levels which is determined by the
product of Bohr magneton μB and magnetic ﬁeld
strength B.
The splitting of the 2l + 1 degenerate m compo-
nents in an external magnetic ﬁeld B due to the
orbital magnetic moment related to the angular
momentum |l| = √l(l + 1)¯h is called the normal
Zeeman effect.

geneous magnetic ﬁeld (nor-
mal Zeeman effect)
Using the Bohr magneton (5.31) we can write the
orbital magnetic moment of the electron as
μl = −(μB/¯h)l .
(5.35a)
Since the external magnetic ﬁeld with cylindrical sym-
metry breaks the spherical symmetry of the Coulomb
potential the orbital angular momentum l of the elec-
tron is no longer constant, because the torque
D = μl × B
(5.35b)
acts on the electron. In the case of a magnetic ﬁeld B =
{0, 0, Bz = B} in the z direction the z component of l
stays constant. The vector l precesses around the z-axis
on a cone with the apex angle 2α (Fig. 5.10), where
cos α = lz
|l| =
m
√l(l + 1) .
(5.35c)
The component lz has the values
lz = m ¯h
with
−l ≤m ≤+l .
(5.35d)
Also, the absolute value of l
|l| =
$
l(l + 1)¯h
(5.36)
is well deﬁned, while the two other components lx
and ly are not deﬁned (see Sect. 4.4.2). Their quantum
mechanical expectation value is zero, as is the classical
time averaged value. Since the magnetic moment ⃗μl is
anti-parallel to ⃗l, it also precesses around the magnetic
ﬁeld axis with a well deﬁned component μz.

ing around the ﬁeld axis. (b) Possible orientations of l and

5. The Hydrogen Atom
For the absorption or emission of light by atoms
in a magnetic ﬁeld, our model makes the following
predictions.
When a circularly polarized σ +-light wave propa-
gates into the z direction all photons have the spin +¯h ˆk.
If they are absorbed by atoms in the magnetic ﬁeld
B = {0, 0, Bz} they transfer their spin +¯h ˆk to the atoms
(because of conservation of angular momentum) and
therefore cause transitions with Δlz = +¯h, where the
quantum number m changes by +1.
For σ −, polarization of the light wave transitions
with Δm = −1 and Δlz = −¯h are induced.
A similar consideration is valid for the emission of
light by atoms in a magnetic ﬁeld. For the light emit-
ted into the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld (i.e., in the
z direction) the two circularly polarized σ + and σ −
components are observed, while for light emitted in-
to the direction perpendicular to the ﬁeld three linearly
polarized components are observed. One component
with the E-vector parallel to B, which is not shifted
against the ﬁeld-free transition, and two components
with E⊥B, which are shifted to opposite sides of the
unshifted line (Fig. 5.11).
According to (5.34), the Zeeman splitting ΔE =
μBB is independent of the quantum numbers n and l.
This implies that all atomic states should have the same
separation of the Zeeman components. Therefore ev-
ery spectral line corresponding to a transition (n1l1) →
(n2,l2) should always split in a magnetic ﬁeld into
three Zeeman components (Fig. 5.12) with σ +, σ −and
π-polarization and a frequency separation of
Δν = μBB/h .

Next we will discuss how this prediction and all the
other conclusions drawn from the Schrödinger model
of the atoms match the experimental results?
5.3 Comparison of Schrödinger
Theory with Experimental Results
Although the hydrogen atom is, from a theoretical point
of view, the simplest atomic system, and can be cal-
culated analytically (at least within the Schrödinger
model), its experimental investigation is not as simple.
There are several reasons for this:
1. First of all hydrogen atoms cannot be bought in
a bottle. They have to be produced by dissociation
of H2 molecules. This can be achieved in several
ways.
The easiest method is dissociation by electron
impact in gas discharges, where electrons with
sufﬁcient kinetic energy collide with hydrogen
molecules H2 to form H atoms, according to the
scheme
H2 + e−→H∗+ H + e−.
The excited atoms H∗in the state |nk⟩release
their excitation energy partly or completely by
emitting photons with energy hν = E(nk) −E(ni)
with Ei < Ek:

171
H∗(nk)
h·ν
−→H(ni) .
Another technique is the thermal dissocia-
tion of H2 molecules at high temperatures (T =
1500 −2000K) in the presence of catalysts (e.g.,
tungsten surfaces).
Nowadays the preferred method is the dissocia-
tion by microwave discharges, which has proved to
be the most efﬁcient way of forming H atoms.
2. The absorption spectrum of ground state hydrogen
atoms lies in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral
region. It therefore can be measured only in the vac-
uum, i.e, in evacuated spectrographs (Fig. 5.13b).
In most experiments the emission rather than the
absorption is measured. The hydrogen discharge is
placed in front of the entrance slit of the evacuated
spectrograph (Fig. 5.13) and the dispersed emis-
sion spectrum of the hydrogen atoms is detected
on a photoplate. Since most materials absorb in the
VUV, no lenses are used and the curved grating
(Rowland arrangement) images the entrance slit on-
to the photoplate. For wavelengths below 120 nm
no entrance window can be used and the air coming
from the outside through the open entrance slit has
to be pumped away by differential pumping in or-
der to maintain the vacuum inside the spectrograph.
Since the emission of excited H atoms has
a spectrum covering the whole range from the in-
frared to the VUV region, that part of the emission
spectrum with wavelengths above 200nm can be
measured with spectrographs in air. Here, the in-
tensity can be enlarged by imaging the discharge
source S by a lens onto the entrance slit and two
curved mirrors M1 and M2 image the entrance
slit S1 onto the CCD camera at the exit (Fig. 5.13a).
As has already been discussed in Sect. 3.4.1 the
lines in the spectrum of the H Atom can be arranged
in series (Fig. 3.40) with wavenumbers that can be
ﬁt by the simple relations

far.

c) The experimentally observed splittings of the
Zeeman components agrees only for a few atomic
species with the prediction of the normal Zeeman
pattern. For most atoms it is more complicated.
For the H atom, for instance, it looks completely
different from the regular triplet pattern in Fig. 5.12.
d) The ground state of the H atom (n = 1, l = 0)
shows a very narrow splitting into two compo-
nents (hyperﬁne structure), which differs for the
two isotopes 1H and 2H = 2D.
In order to explain these deviations, the Schrödinger
theory has to be extended and new atomic parameters
have to be included. This will be discussed in the next
sections.
5.4 Relativistic Correction
of Energy Terms
The last section has shown, that the coarse structure
of the hydrogen spectrum is well described by the
Schrödinger-theory for an electron in the Coulomb-
ﬁeld of the atomic nucleus. The small discrepancies
found by comparison of experimental results with the-
oretical predictions are due to relativistic effects. There
are essentially three contributions to these effects:
1. The relativistic dependence of the electron mass on
its velocity in the Coulomb-ﬁeld which results in a
small decrease of its kinetic energy

5.4. Relativistic Correction of Energy Terms
173
2. A closer inspection of the relativistic treatment
shows that the electron charge is “smeared out”
over a volume λc3 = (¯h/mec)3 where λc is the
Compton wavelength of the electron. This leads to
a change of the potential energy of the electron
(Darwin-term)
3. The interaction between the magnetic moment of
the electron due to its orbital angular momentum
and the magnetic moment due to the electron spin
results in a shift and a splitting of the energy levels
(ﬁne-structure).
We will now brieﬂy discuss these three contribu-
tions and their magnitude.
1) Relativistic mass increase
Instead of the nonrelativistic energy relation
E = p2/2m + Epot
(5.38)
anticipated by the Schrödinger theory, we have to use
the relativistic energy relation
E = c

m2
0c2 + p2 −m0c2 + Epot .
(5.39)
For the electron in the hydrogen atom, the velocity v
of the electron is still small compared to the velocity of
light c, which means that Ekin m0c2 or p2/m2

(5.40)
For Ekin  m0c2 we can neglect the higher order
terms. In this approximation the last term in (5.40)
represents the relativistic correction ΔEr to the non-
relativistic energy (5.38).
We can obtain the quantum mechanical expectation
value of this correction by substituting p →−i ¯h∇,
which leads to the expression

(5.44)
which now depends not only on n but also on l! The
relativistic correction is maximum for n = 1 and l = 0.
EXAMPLES
1. For n = 1, l = 0 the magnitude of the relativistic
correction is
ΔEr = −Z2E15α2/4 .
2. For Z = 1 this becomes
ζEr = −9 × 10−4 eV .
3. For n = 2, l = 0 we obtain
ΔEr(n = 2,l = 0) = −13
16 Z2E2α2
= 1.5 × 10−4 eV. for Z = 1
4. For n = 2, l = 1 the correction is only
ΔEr(n = 2,l = 1) = −7
48 E2Z2α2
= Z2 · 2.6 × 10−5 eV .
This illustrates that
a) The relativistic energy shift is maximum for the
ground state of atoms (n = 1,l = 0).

174
5. The Hydrogen Atom
b) The correction depends on both quantum numbers n
and l. The n-fold degeneracy of states (n,l), de-
duced from the Schrödinger theory is lifted by the
relativistic correction.
c) At a given value of n, the electron comes closest
to the nucleus (and therefore acquires the largest
velocity) for small values of l (the Sommerfeld or-
bits are then ellipses with large eccentricity). The
relativistic mass increase is then maximum, which
decreases the energy term value. For the maximum
allowed l = n −1 the orbit is circular and the ve-
locity of the electron has a constant medium value.
The relativistic mass correction is then minimum.
Note:
As the numerical examples show, the relativistic mass
correction only amounts to less than 10−4 of the
Coulomb energy.
2) Darwin-Term
The second relativistic contribution comes from the
fact, that, even in a model which describes the electron
as a point charge, the momentary position of the elec-
tron cannot be deﬁned more precisely than within the
volume λ3
c = (¯h/mec)3 given by the Compton wave-
length λc of the electron. The potential energy of the
electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus is then the
weighted average of all values of the electric ﬁeld with-
in the volume λ3
c around the point r. This means: the
potential energy is no longer Epot(r) but is determined
by the integral
Epot(r) = ∫f(ρ)Epot(r + ρ) d3ρ
(5.45)
over the volume λ3
c around the point r. Expanding
Epot(r + ρ) into a Taylor series of powers of ρ around
the point ρ = 0 gives
Epot(r + ρ) = Epot(r) + (dEpot/dρ)ρ= 0 · ρ
+1/2(d2Epot/dρ2)·ρ2+. . . . . (5.46)
the ﬁrst term gives the unperturbed potential used in
the Schrödinger theory. The second term vanishes be-
cause of the spherical symmetry of the Coulomb ﬁeld.
The third term, inserted into (5.45) gives the relativistic
Darwin correction which is of the order of magnitude
(¯h/mec)2ζEpot(r), where ζ is the Laplace operator.
For the Coulomb potential Epot(r)=−(Ze2/4πε0r)
we obtain
ζEpot = (Ze2/ε0)δ(r)
(where δ(r) is the delta function δ(r) = 1 for r = 0 and
δ(r ̸= 0) = 0) and the relativistic correction becomes
Wrel = +(Ze2 ¯h2/ε0m2
ec
2) · δ(r)
(5.47)
The quantum mechanical expectation value, ob-
tained with the hydrogen wavefunction ψ gives the
Darwin term
WD = +(Ze2¯h2/ε0m2
ec
2) |ψ(0)|2
(5.48)
where ψ(0) is the wavefunction at the origin r = 0.
Since only the s-functions have nonvanishing values at
r = 0 we can insert the hydrogen 1s-function
ψ1s = 1/√π(Z/a0)3/2e−Zr/a0
and obtain with the deﬁnition of a0 and the ﬁne-
structure constant α
WD = 4Z4mec2α4 .
(5.49)
With the nonrelativistic energy
W0 = Enr = (1/2)mec2(Z2/n
2)α2
(5.50)
the ratio WD/W 0 of Darwin term to the nonrelativistic
energy becomes
WD/W 0 = 2Z2α2 ≈8(Z/137)2 .
(5.51)
For Z = 1 the Darwin correction is about 10−4Enr.
We will now discuss the third relativistic correction,
namely the interaction between the orbital magnetic
moment and the spin moment of the electron, causing
the ﬁne structure of spectral lines.
5.5 The Electron Spin
Several experimental results such as the Stern-Gerlach
experiment, the ﬁne-structure of spectral lines or the
anomalous Zeeman effect indicated that the electron
must have, besides its charge −e and mass me an
additional characteristic property, which was called
electron spin and which must cause an additional mag-
netic moment μs in addition to the orbital magnetic
moment μl. This had been already postulated by Fermi,
before it could be experimentally conﬁrmed.

5.5. The Electron Spin
175
5.5.1 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment
The space quantization of the angular momentum in-
troduced by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1916 was consid-
ered by many physicists as a purely theoretical model
without any real correspondence in nature. It was there-
fore in doubt if the explanation of the Zeeman effect
by the corresponding space quantization of the mag-
netic moment could ever be proved experimentally.
Nevertheless this issue was intensely discussed among
experimental physicists. Otto Stern (1888–1969), who
had a lot of experience with atomic beams, proposed
to test the idea of space quantization by measuring
the deﬂection of atoms in a collimated atomic beam
passing through a transverse inhomogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld. He found in Walther Gerlach (1889–1979) an en-
thusiastic and experimentally skillful assistant whom
he convinced to try this experiment. They started in
1919 and after many unsuccessful efforts and follow-
ing improvements to their beam apparatus, the two
researchers were ﬁnally rewarded with an unexpected
result in 1921 [5.1].
They chose as test objects silver atoms because
these atoms could be detected on a glass plate, where
they condensate and form a thin layer with an optical
transparency depending on the thickness of the layer
and therefore the number of incident atoms.
The silver atoms were evaporated in a hot furnace
and emerged through a narrow hole A in the furnace
into the vacuum chamber (Fig. 5.15). They were then
collimated by the slit S before they entered, traveling in
the x direction, the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld Bz,
which pointed in the z direction. In the plane x = x0
the atoms were condensed on a cold glass plate. With
a densitometer the density N(z) of silver atoms on the
glass plate could be measured.
Without a magnetic ﬁeld, the symmetric blue den-
sity proﬁle corresponding to the central curve in
Fig. 5.15c was obtained. It represents the density pro-
ﬁle of the non-deﬂected atomic beam due to the spread
of the transverse velocity components of the silver
atoms behind the collimating slit S.
In the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld the force
F = −μ · grad B
on the atoms depends on the spatial orientation of the
magnetic moment μ relative to B. The intensity distri-
bution I(z) is therefore expected to split into as many
peaks as the possible values of the scalar product μ · B.
At that time the quantum number l of the orbital an-
gular momentum of silver was assumed to be l = 1.
Therefore three possible values of μB were expected,
corresponding to the three magnetic quantum numbers

5. The Hydrogen Atom
ml = 0, ±1. The experimental result clearly showed
only two peaks and a minimum intensity in between
the peaks where atoms with m = 0 should arrive. Bohr,
who was asked for advice, explained this result by
a model that assumed that atoms with their magnetic
moment perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld (m = 0) were unstable and would ﬂip into one of
the other quantum states with m = ±1 [5.1].
Stern and Gerlach had proved with their pioneer-
ing experiment that space quantization is a real effect
and does not only exist in the brain of theoreticians.
O. Stern later on received the Nobel Price 1944 for his
contribution to the development of the molecular beam
technique and the discovery of the magnetic moment of
the proton.
Although their experiment was a very ingenious
demonstration of space quantization, it turned out
that the interpretation of their results was not correct,
because the splitting was not due to the orbital an-
gular momentum, but to a new quantity called the
electron spin, which was postulated as a new charac-
teristic property of the electron after further convincing
experimental discoveries.
5.5.2 Experimental Conﬁrmation of Electron Spin
When spectroscopic measurements showed that the
ground state of silver atoms is in fact an s state with
l = 0, Bohr’s explanation of the results of the Stern–
Gerlach experiment could no longer be regarded as
correct.
Samuel A. Goudsmit (1902–1978) and George
E. Uhlenbeck (1900–1988) proposed a new model
where the electron possesses an intrinsic angular mo-
mentum, called the electron spin in addition to a pos-
sible orbital angular momentum. This model attributes
a new property to the electron, which is then charac-
terized by its mass m, its charge q = −e, its orbital
angular momentum l and its spin s which is connected
with a magnetic moment μs that can interact with mag-
netic ﬁelds. Many further experimental ﬁndings such as
the ﬁne structure in atomic spectra and deviations from
the normal Zeeman splittings (called the anomalous
Zeeman effect) corroborated this hypothesis.
This spin can be mathematically treated like an
angular momentum and is therefore often regarded
as a mechanical “eigen-angular momentum” of the
electron. The astronomical analogy is the earth revolv-
ing around the sun in one year but simultaneously
turning around its own axis within one day. The total
angular momentum of the earth is the orbital angu-
lar momentum plus the “spin” of the earth. Similarly,
the electron of the hydrogen atom has for l > 0 an
orbital angular momentum l = r × p and in addition
its spin s. However, as will be discussed in Sect. 5.8
this interpretation of the electron spin as a mechan-
ical angular momentum runs into serious difﬁculties.
Nevertheless the spin can be treated as a vector obey-
ing the same mathematical rules as the orbital angular
momentum.
In analogy to the orbital angular momentum the
absolute value of the spin s is written as
|s| =
$
s(s + 1)¯h
,
(5.52)
where s is the spin quantum number, which had already
been introduced by Pauli as an additional quantum
number in order to explain the different components in
the ﬁne structure of observed spectra (see below). Pauli,
however, regarded this as a pure mathematical quanti-
ty and resisted giving it a physical meaning as a real
angular momentum.
The magnetic spin moment μs is related to the
spin by
μs = γss ,
(5.53)
where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of magnetic moment
to spin.
From the experimental result of the Stern–Gerlach
experiment, that the beam of silver atoms was split
in the inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld into two compo-
nents, it can be concluded that the angular momentum
should have two possible orientations. Since spectro-
scopic investigations of the silver atom proved that the
orbital angular momentum in the ground state is zero,
the splitting must be due to electron spin. The mag-
netic spin moment μs must have two orientations and
therefore the electron spin must also have two compo-
nents sz = msh. If the electron spin should be treated
as an angular momentum then the quantum number ms
must obey the relation −s ≤ms ≤+s. Since ms can
only change by an integer value, the explanation of two

ing to the introduction of the electron spin and will then
discuss some basic theoretical considerations.
5.5.3 Einstein–de Haas Effect
Einstein proposed the following experiment in order to
gain insight into the causes of magnetic properties of
solids. It was actually performed some years later by
the Dutch physicist Wander Johannes de Haas (1878–
1960).
An iron cylinder with mass m and radius R hangs
on a thin wire (Fig. 5.17) in a vertical magnetic ﬁeld
B = {0, 0, Bz}, produced by an electric current through
a coil. The magnetic ﬁeld was chosen sufﬁciently
strong to saturate the magnetization M = Nμ of the
cylinder with N free electrons, each possessing the
magnetic moment μ. In cases of saturation, all mag-
netic moments point in one direction opposite to that
of the magnetic ﬁeld. Since the free electrons in the
conduction band of iron have no orbital angular mo-
mentum and therefore also no orbital magnetic moment
(there is no force center to cause a circular motion of
the electrons) the magnetic moment must have another

reason. We will see that it is caused by the spins of the
free electrons.
Note:
In iron, the magnetic moment is not exclusively caused
by the free electrons in the conduction band. A mi-
nor contribution also comes from the electrons bound
in the iron atoms. They can have orbital angular mo-
mentum and spin. However, this contribution is small
and we will neglect it for the following discussion. (For
a more detailed discussion see textbooks on solid state
physics).
If the magnetic ﬁeld is reversed, all magnetic mo-
ments ﬂip into the opposite direction. This causes
a change in magnetization
ΔM = 2M = 2Nμ .
(5.55)
From the measurement of ΔM the product Nμ can be
determined.
The reversal of the magnetic moments also results
in a ﬂip of the corresponding angular momenta s of all
electrons. The resulting change
ΔS = 2N sz = −ΔL = −Iω
(5.56)
has to be compensated by the opposite change ΔL
of the mechanical angular momentum ⃗L of the cylin-
der with the moment of inertia I = (1/2)M R2. With
a reversal of the magnetic ﬁeld, the cylinder that was
initially at rest acquires the angular momentum −L =
−(1/2)M R2ω and a rotational energy
Erot = L2/2I = L2/(M R2) ,
(5.57a)
which results in a torsion of the suspension wire
with a restoring force Fr = −Drϕ. The maximum

178
5. The Hydrogen Atom
torsion angle ϕmax is reached when the potential
energy
Epot = 1
2 Drϕ2
max = Erot = L2/2I
(5.57b)
of the twisted suspension wire equals the kinetic ro-
tational energy. The measurement of ϕmax therefore
allows the determination of L. The experiment gave the
surprising result
ΔL = N ¯h = 2N ¯h/2 .
(5.57c)
This means that the z component of the angular mo-
mentum of each electron must have the amount sz =
¯h/2. From the measured magnetization change ΔM it
was, however, clear that the magnetic moment relat-
ed to this angular momentum must be μ = μB, i.e, the
same as for the orbital angular momentum with l = 1¯h.
The gyromagnetic ratio
ΔM/ΔS = Δμs
Δsz
= |μs|
|s| = μB
1/2¯h = γs
(5.58)
of magnetic moment |μs| and angular momentum |s|
is therefore twice as large as for the orbital angular
momentum, where it is
|μl|/|l| = μB/¯h = γl .
(5.59)
This means that γs is twice as large as γl!
For the electron spin, the ratio of magnetic mo-
ment to mechanical angular momentum is twice
as large as for the orbital angular momentum of
the electron.
The magnetic spin moment is written analogously
to the orbital moment μl = −(μB/¯h)l as
μs = −gs(μB/¯h)s .
(5.60a)
The factor gs ≈2 is called the Landë factor.
The absolute value of the magnetic spin moment is
|μs| = gsμB
$
s(s + 1) .
(5.60b)
Remark
Here the electron spin has been introduced phenomeno-
logically. The exact value of the Landë factor gs =
2.0023 can only be explained by a theory that already
includes the electron spin in the basic equations. Such
a theory has been developed by Paul Dirac (1902–
1984) who replaced the Schrödinger equation with the
Dirac equation. Its representation exceeds, however,
the level of this textbook.
5.5.4 Spin-Orbit Coupling and Fine Structure
We will now discuss why the energy levels of the H
atom with l > 0, split into two components, which
could not be explained by the Schrödinger theory.
Since this splitting is very small and can be only re-
solved with high resolution spectrographs, where the
hydrogen lines appear as a ﬁne substructure, it was
named ﬁne structure.
We start with a semiclassical model, treating the
angular momenta as vectors with quantized absolute
values and quantized z components. In Sect. 5.2 it was
shown that an electron with charge −e, moving with
the orbital angular momentum l on a circle around the
nucleus, produces a magnetic moment
μl = −e
2me
l = −(μB/¯h) · l .
That is proportional to l.
In a coordinate system where the electron rests at
the origin, the nucleus with positive charge Z · e moves
with the frequency ν on a circle around the electron.
This causes a circular current Zeν that produces a mag-
netic ﬁeld B at the location of the electron (Fig. 5.18).
According to Biot–Savart’s law (see textbooks on mag-
netic ﬁelds) this magnetic ﬁeld is
Bl = μ0Ze
4πr3 (v × (−r)) = −μ0Ze
4πr3 (v × r)

tor model with the electron circling around the at. (b) trans-
formation to a coordinate system, where the electron rests at

5.5. The Electron Spin
179
because the angular momentum of the electron in a co-
ordinate system where the electron moves around the
proton at rest is ⃗l = me(⃗v × ⃗r) and the transformation
to the rest frame of the electron changes the sign of the
vector product.
The magnetic spin moment of the electron has two
spatial orientations in this ﬁeld according to the two
spin directions sz = ±¯h/2. This causes an additional
energy (in addition to the Coulomb energy)
ΔE = −μs · Bl = gsμB
μ0Ze
4πr3me¯h (s · l)
≈μ0Ze2
4πm2er3 (s · l) .
(5.62)
because gs ≈2 and μB = e¯h/2me. In this coordinate
system the electron is not in an inertial frame of refer-
ence. Transforming the coordinate system back to the
rest-frame of the nucleus by a Lorentz transformation
gives a factor 1/2 (Thomas factor [5.2]), which is due
to the fact that the electron spin in the rest-frame of
the nucleus precesses when moving around the nucleus
(Thomas precession).
The energy levels En of (5.18), which had been ob-
tained without taking into account the electron spin,
now split, due to the spin-orbit coupling, into the ﬁne
structure components with energies
En,l,s = En −μs · Bl = En + μ0Ze2
8πm2er3 (s · l) .
(5.63)
The scalar product (s · l) may be positive or negative
depending on the orientation of the spin relative to the
orbital angular momentum.
When we introduce the total angular momentum
j = l + s
with
| j| =
$
j( j + 1)¯h
(5.64a)
as a vector sum of orbital angular momentum l and
electron spin s (Fig. 5.19), we can square this sum and
obtain
j2 = l2 + s2 + 2l · s .
(5.64b)
This gives for the scalar product of the vectors ⃗l and ⃗s
l · s = 1
2 ¯h2[ j( j + 1) −l(l + 1) −s(s + 1)] .

(5.66b)
For s = 1
2 the energy levels split, depending on the
orientation of the spin, into the two components with
j = l + 1/2 and j = l −1/2 (see Fig. 5.20).
Note: Finestructure splittings are observed only for
levels with l ≥1, i.e. for p, d, f , . . . levels, not for s-
levels with l = 0.
The ﬁne structure may be regarded as Zeeman
splitting due to the interaction of the magnet-
ic spin moment with the internal magnetic ﬁeld
generated by the orbital motion of the electron.
In the quantum mechanical model the distance r
of the electron from the nucleus cannot be given ex-
actly. Only the time-averaged value of r related to the
probability of ﬁnding the electron at the location r is
a measurable quantity

is Sommerfeld’s ﬁne structure constant, which was

rection of the level energies.
The energy separation of the two ﬁne structure
components (n,l, j = l + 1/2) and (n,l, j = l −1/2)
is then, according to (5.66) and (5.68),

(5.70)
This shows that the splitting is very small compared to
the energy En,l of the levels (n,l) and justiﬁes the name
“ﬁne structure.” Note, that En < 0!
As can be seen from (5.70), the ﬁne structure split-
ting decreases with increasing quantum numbers n
and l, but it increases proportionally to the product
Z2En. Since the energies En of the levels with prin-
cipal quantum number n follow the relation En ∝
Z2/n2, we can write the ﬁne structure splitting as
ΔEn,l,s ∝
Z4
n3l(l + 1) .
(5.71)
EXAMPLE
For the 2p level of the H atom, we have Z = 1, n = 2,
l = 1 and En = −3.4 eV. From (5.70) we therefore
obtain for the ﬁne structure splitting ΔEl,s = 4.6 ×
10−5 eV ⇒ΔEl,s/hc = Δ¯ν = 0.37 cm−1.
If both effects, the relativistic increase of the elec-
tron mass and the spin-orbit coupling, are taken into
account we have to add (5.42) and (5.66a) and obtain
for the energy of a ﬁne structure component (n,l, j)

Fig. 5.22. Energy level scheme of the hydrogen atom, taking into account the relativistic mass increase and the spin-orbit
coupling. The dashed lines mark the energies obtained from the Schrödinger equation
In the Coulomb ﬁeld with Epot ∝1/r the energy
of a ﬁne structure component (n,l, j) does not
depend on the quantum number l. All levels with
equal quantum numbers n and j have the same
energy (Fig. 5.22).
EXAMPLE
The two levels 2s1/2 and 2p1/2 or 3p3/2 and 3d3/2 have
the same energy (Fig. 5.22).
Note: This degeneracy applies only to one-electron
systems such as the hydrogen atom or the ions He+,
Li++, etc., where the electron moves in a Coulomb
potential. This is because the assumption Epot ∝1/r
enters into the relativistic mass correction, as well as
in (5.67), for the calculation of the ﬁne structure con-
stant. For atoms with more than one electron there is
no longer a Coulomb potential because of the mutual
interaction between the electrons. Here levels with dif-
ferent values of the quantum number l have different
energies even for equal quantum numbers j.
5.5.5 Anomalous Zeeman Effect
When the electron spin s and the magnetic spin mo-
ment μs are taken into account, the total magnetic
moment depends on the coupling of the two vectors
μl + μs. The Zeeman splittings of levels in a magnetic
ﬁeld now become more complicated than those for the
normal Zeeman effect shown in Figs. 5.11 and 5.12,
which are only observed, if the total spin of the atom-
ic electrons is S = - si = 0. This is, for instance,
the case for the helium atom with two electrons with
antiparallel spins in its ground state (see Sect. 6.1).
Without a magnetic ﬁeld, the total angular mo-
mentum j = l + s of the electron in a Coulomb ﬁeld
(central force ﬁeld) is constant, which means that its

orientation in space and its absolute value are con-
stant, independent of time (Fig. 5.23a). In an external
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B = {0, 0, Bz}, the mag-
netic moment μ j, and therefore j, precess around
the ﬁeld axis with constant components μz and jz
(Fig. 5.23b).
If the external magnetic ﬁeld is weaker than the
magnetic ﬁeld generated by the orbital movement of
the electron, the Zeeman splitting is smaller than the
ﬁne structure splittings. In other words, the coupling
between orbital angular momentum and spin is stronger
than the coupling of μl and μs to the external ﬁeld.
The spin-orbit coupling is still valid and the absolute
value | j| of the total angular momentum
j = l + s
with
| j| =
$
j( j + 1)h
(5.72a)
is conserved in the external magnetic ﬁeld. Its direction
is, however, no longer space-ﬁxed because the mag-
netic moment μ j = μl + μs, which is related to j,
experiences a torque
D = μ j × B .
(5.72b)
For one-electron systems the component jz can take
the values jz = m j ¯h with the half-integer values −jz ≤
m j ≤+ jz (Fig. 5.23c).
The magnetic moments of orbital motion and spin
of the electron are:
μl = −(μB/¯h)l
and
μs = −gs(μB/¯h)s .
(5.72c)
There is an important point to mention:
Because of the Landë factor gs ≈2 for the spin
moment μs, the total magnetic moment
μ j = μl + μs = −(μB/¯h)(l + gss)
(5.73)
is for l > 0 no longer parallel to the total angular
momentum j = l + s!
Without an external ﬁeld the absolute value and the
direction of j is constant in time. Since the vector s
precesses around the axis of the internal magnetic ﬁeld
produced by the orbital movement of the electron and
μ j is not parallel to j, μ j has to precess around the
direction of the space-ﬁxed vector j. The time aver-
age

of μ j is then the projection of μ j onto j

The Landë factor g j is deﬁned here as
g j = 1 + j( j + 1) + s(s + 1) −l(l + 1)
2 j( j + 1)
.
(5.76)
For s = 0 (pure orbital magnetism) it follows j = l and
we obtain g j = 1. For l = 0 (pure spin magnetism) is
j = s and therefore g j ≈2. If orbital angular momen-
tum and spin both contribute to the magnetic moment,
the value of the Lande factor g can be calculated from
eq. (5.76).
In an external magnetic ﬁeld B = {0, 0, Bz}, the
spatial orientation of the total angular momentum is no
longer constant. The vector j precesses around the ﬁeld
direction. The projection of j can take the values
jz = mjh
with
−j ≤mj ≤+ j .
The precession of μ j around j is faster than that of j
around B as long as the ﬁnestructure splitting is larger
than the Zeeman splitting. Therefore the z component

5. The Hydrogen Atom
The energy of a speciﬁc Zeeman component m j of
a ﬁne structure level |n,l, j > is them obtained from
(5.76) and (5.77) as

(

)
+ m jg jμBB
(5.77b)
The energy separation between two adjacent Zeeman
components comes out as
ΔEm j −ΔEm j−1 = g jμBB .
(5.78)
Since the Landë factor g j depends on the quan-
tum numbers l and j,according to (5.76), the
Zeeman splitting for the anomalous Zeeman ef-
fect differs for the different levels (n,l, j), con-
trary to the situation for the normal Zeeman
effect. Therefore, the Zeeman pattern of spec-
tral lines is more complicated here. There are
generally more than three Zeeman components.
The following examples shall illustrate the situa-
tion for the anomalous Zeeman effect. In Fig. 5.25
the Zeeman pattern of the two D-lines in the sodi-
um spectrum are shown, corresponding to the transi-
tions Na 32S1/2 →3 2P1/2 (D1 line) and Na 3 2S1/2 →
3 2P3/2 (D2 line). For the H atom a completely sim-
ilar pattern is obtained. Only the spin-orbit coupling
constant a is smaller and therefore the ﬁne structure
splitting smaller. The Lande factors of the different
levels are

The spectrum shows four Zeeman components for the
transition 3 2S1/2 →3 2P1/2 and six components for the
3 2S1/2 →3 2P3/2, which are not equidistant.
As for the normal Zeeman effect, transitions with
Δm j = ±1 are circularly polarized and those with
Δm j = 0 are linearly polarized with the electric ﬁeld
vector E in the direction of the external magnetic
ﬁeld.
5.6 Hyperﬁne Structure
In the previous sections we have described the atomic
nucleus as a point-like charge Ze that interacts with the
electron merely through the electric Coulomb-potential
φ(r) = −
Ze
4πε0r .
With this potential the Schrödinger equation allowed
the calculation of the term values of all levels in the
H atom and the wavenumbers of all transitions between
these levels. The ﬁne structure of the spectral lines
was explained by the magnetic interaction between the
magnetic moments of the orbital angular momentum
and the electron spin. This magnetic interaction was
just added to the Coulomb interaction. It cannot be
calculated from the Schrödinger equation, which does
not include the electron spin.
5.6.1 Basic Considerations
If the hydrogen spectrum is observed with very high
spectral resolution, one ﬁnds that even the ﬁne struc-
ture components are split into two subcomponents.
The separation of these sub-components is, for the
H atom, smaller than the Doppler width of the spec-
tral lines and therefore these components cannot be
recognized with Doppler-limited resolution. This very
small splitting, which for many atoms can only be
resolved with special Doppler-free spectroscopic tech-
niques (see Chap. 12), is called hyperﬁne structure. It
is explained as follows.
Atomic nuclei have a small but ﬁnite volume
and possess, besides their electric charge Ze another
characteristic quantity ⃗I, called the nuclear spin ana-
logue to the electron spin ⃗s. Its absolute value
|I| =
$
I(I + 1)¯h
(5.79)
is described by the nuclear spin quantum number I.
The projection of I onto the z-axis is
Iz = mI ¯h
with
−I ≤mI ≤+I .
(5.80)
The nuclear spin ⃗I can be treated as an angular momen-
tum in complete analogy to the electron spin.
A magnetic moment is connected with the nuclear
spin
μN = γKI .
(5.81)

5.6. Hyperﬁne Structure
185
The unit of the nuclear magnetic moment is the nuclear
magneton
μK =
e
2mp ¯h = me
mp
μB = μB
1836
= 5.05 × 10−27 J T−1
(5.82)
analogue to the Bohr magneton μB. However, the
nuclear magneton is smaller by a factor me/mp ≈
1/1836. The magnetic moment of the proton is
μI(p) = 2.79μK and is determined by the movements
and charges of the three quarks (u,u,d) inside the
proton.
The magnetic moment of any atomic nucleus can be
written in units of the nuclear magneton as
μN = γKI = gN
μK
¯h I ,
(5.83)
where the dimensionless factor gN = γK ¯h/μK is called
the nuclear g-factor.
The nuclear magnetic moment gives two contribu-
tions to the shift and splitting of energy levels of the
atomic electrons:
a) The interaction of the nuclear magnetic moment μN
with the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the electrons
at the nucleus (Zeeman effect of μN in the internal
magnetic ﬁeld produced by the electrons).
b) The interaction of the electronic magnetic mo-
ment μ j with the nuclear moment μN (magnetic
dipole-dipole interaction).
The potential energy of the nuclear magnetic mo-
ment μN in the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the electron
at the location of the nucleus is (Fig. 5.26)
Fig. 5.26. Interaction between nuclear magnetic moment μI
and the magnetic ﬁeld B j produced at the location of the
nucleus by the orbital motion of the electron and the magnetic
moment μs due to the electron spin s
Epot(I, j) = −μN · Bint = −|μN|B j cos(̸
j, I) .
(5.84)
Introducing the total angular momentum F = j + I
of the atom as the vector sum of the total electronic
angular momentum j = l + s and the nuclear spin I
(Fig. 5.27), we obtain, because of j · I = 1/2(F2 −
j2 −I2) = | j||I| cos(̸
j, I) ,
cos ̸ ( j, I) =
j · I
| j||I|
= 1

F(F + 1) −j( j + 1) −I(I + 1)
√j( j + 1)I(I + 1)
.
(5.84a)
The hyperﬁne energy of the H atom is then
ΔEHFS = A
2 [F(F + 1) −j( j + 1) −I(I + 1)] ,
(5.85)
where the hyperﬁne constant
A =
gNμKB j
√j( j + 1)
(5.86)
depends on the internal magnetic ﬁeld produced by the
electron, and is therefore dependent on the electronic
angular momentum j.
Each energy level En,l, j splits into hyperﬁne
components, due to the interaction between nu-
clear magnetic moment and electronic magnetic
moments. The energy of these components is
EHFS = En,l, j
+ 1
2 A[F(F + 1) −j( j + 1) −I(I + 1)] .

5. The Hydrogen Atom
For the H atom, with a proton as the nucleus, the
experiments give the values
I = 1/2,
gI = +5.58 ⇒(μN)z = ±2.79μK .
For the ground state 2S1/2 is j = 1/2, I = 1/2 ⇒F =
0 or F = 1. This gives the two hyperﬁne components
(Fig. 5.28).

5.6.2 Fermi-contact Interaction
The internal magnetic ﬁeld at the location r = 0 of the
nucleus depends on j and on the spatial probability dis-
tribution |ψn,l|2 of the electron. The hyperﬁne splitting
is particularly large for 1S states where ψ has a max-
imum for r = 0. The magnetic interaction of the 1s
electron with the nucleus is called Fermi-contact inter-
action, because there is close contact between the elec-
tron and the nucleus. A more detailed calculation shows
that for S states the hyperﬁne constant is given by
A = 2
3μ0glμBgNμK|ψn(r = 0)|2 .
(5.89)
This is the dominant contribution for the HFS
of the H atom. The absolute value of the hyperﬁne
splitting in the 2S1/2 ground state of the H atom is
Δ¯ν = 0.0474 cm−1. In the optical spectral region it
can only be resolved with special Doppler-free tech-
niques. One example is the Doppler-free two-photon
absorption 1S →2S (Fig. 5.29), where two photons
are simultaneously absorbed out of two antiparallel
laser beams. The splitting of the two lines in Fig. 5.29
reﬂects the difference Δν = (ΔE(1S) −ΔE(2S))/h
of the hyperﬁne splittings of the lower and the upper
state of the transition with ΔF = F(1S) −F(2S) = 0.
The splitting ΔE(2S) is small compared to that of the
ground state.
The total angular momentum F has to be conserved
for the two photon transition because the two absorbed
photons have opposite spins. They therefore do not
transfer angular momentum to the atom.
The hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state 1S can
be directly measured by a magnetic dipole transition
(see Sect. 7.2.6) between the two HFS components.
This transition lies in the microwave range with a wave-
length of λ = 21 cm. It plays an important role in radio
astronomy, because H atoms are the most abundant
species in the universe and H atoms in interstellar
clouds can be excited by star radiation into the upper
HFS level and can emit this transition as radio signals
received on earth by large parabolic radio antennas.
The measurements of the signal amplitude with spatial
resolution gives information about the density distri-
bution, velocities and temperatures of H atoms in the
universe.

5.6. Hyperﬁne Structure
187
5.6.3 Magnetic Dipole-Dipole Interaction
The second contribution to the hyperﬁne splitting is the
dipole-dipole interaction between the magnetic dipoles
of the electron and the nucleus. This contribution is
zero for S states with a spherically symmetric charge
distribution, because the average of the electronic mag-
netic moment is zero. It therefore plays a role only for
states with l ≥1 (Fig. 5.30), where the ﬁrst contribu-
tion is small because the electron density at r = 0 is
zero (Fig. 5.3).
For larger atoms there are also electrostatic contri-
butions to the hyperﬁne structure if the nucleus has an
electric quadrupole moment. For the H atom, howev-
er, this electrostatic contribution is absent because the
proton has no electric quadrupole moment.

5.6.4 Zeeman Effect of Hyperﬁne Structure Levels
In a weak external magnetic ﬁeld B the hyperﬁne
component with F = 1 splits into three Zeeman
sublevels with mF = 0, ±1, while the component with
F = 0 does not split. This is, however, only observed
for weak ﬁelds as long as the interaction energy ΔEHFS
between nuclear magnetic moment and electron mo-
ments is larger than the Zeeman coupling energy μs B
between the electronic spin moment and the exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld. This gives rise to the anomalous
Zeeman effect of the hyperﬁne levels.
For stronger ﬁelds, when μs · B becomes larger
than ΔEHFS the electron spin s and the nuclear spin I
become uncoupled and the energy EF of the levels
is governed by the interaction energy μs · B between
electronic magnetic moment and external ﬁeld. In this
case there are only two Zeeman components with sz =
±1/2. Each of these components shows a hyperﬁne
splitting into two HFS components with mI = ±1/2
(Fig. 5.31).
This uncoupling of angular momentum by the
magnetic ﬁeld is called the Paschen–Back effect
(Fig. 5.32). It appears for hyperﬁne structure at rather
small magnetic ﬁelds. It is also observed for the ﬁne
structure levels, but only at higher ﬁelds, because the

netic ﬁeld produced by l is generally much larger than

5.7 Complete Description
of the Hydrogen Atom
The preceding sections have shown that all the effects
discussed so far make the spectrum of the simplest
atom more complicated than was assumed in Bohr’s
model of the H atom. In this section we will summa-
rize all phenomena discussed in this chapter and some
new ones for a complete description of the hydrogen
spectrum.
5.7.1 Total Wave Function and Quantum Numbers
The solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the H
atom gave (without taking into account the electron
spin) n2 different wave functions for each value of the
principal quantum number n. They represent n2 differ-
ent atomic states with the same energy (they are n2-fold
degenerate), but with different spatial distributions of
the electron density. Each of these n2 wave functions
ψn,l,ml(x, y, z) = Rn,l(r)Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ)
(5.90a)
is unambiguously deﬁned by the quantum numbers n,l,
and ml.
The introduction of the electron spin with its two
possible orientations sz = ±1/2¯h against the z-axis
(which is chosen as preferential axis by general agree-
ment and is called the quantization axis) adds a new
quantum number ms = ±1/2, which deﬁnes the pro-
jection of the electron spin onto the quantization axis.
Each of the spatial electron distributions ψn,l,m(x, y, z)
can be realized with two spin orientations. This is
described by multiplying the spatial wave function
ψn,l,ml(x, y, z) with a spin function χms(sz) that deﬁnes
the projection sz = ms ¯h of the electron spin s onto the
quantization axis. We label the spin function as χ+ for
ms = +1/2 and as χ−for ms = −1/2. The total wave
function, including the electron spin, is then
ψn,l,ml,ms(x, y, z, sz) = ψn,l,ml(x, y, z)χms .
(5.90b)
Each electronic state of a one-electron atom
is unambiguously deﬁned by the four quantum
numbers n,l, ml and ms. It is described by a sin-
gle wave function (5.90).
5.7.2 Term Assignment and Level Scheme
For the complete assignment of an atomic state by
its quantum numbers (n,l, ml, s, ms) the short hand
notation
n 2s+1X j
(5.91a)
is used. The letter n denotes the principal quantum
number. The capital letter X stands for S (l = 0),
P (l = 1), D (l = 2), F (l = 3), . . .. The upper left in-
dex 2s + 1 is the multiplicity, which gives the number
of ﬁne structure components for s > 0, provided the or-
bital angular momentum quantum number is l > 0. For
systems with only one electron outside closed shells is
s = 1/2 and the multiplicity is 2s + 1 = 2. Atoms with
a single electron always have doublet states, which split
into two ﬁne structure components for l > 0. The low-
er right index in (5.91a) gives the quantum number j
of the total electronic angular momentum j = l + s
(Fig. 5.19).
The hyperﬁne components are labeled by the quan-
tum number F of the total angular momentum F =
j + I, including the nuclear spin I (Fig. 5.27).

5. The Hydrogen Atom
EXAMPLE
The ﬁrst excited state 2 2P of the H atom that can
be reached by one-photon excitation from the 1 2S1/2
ground state is deﬁned by the quantum numbers n = 2,
s = 1/2, l = 1, and j = 1/2 or j = 3/2. The two ﬁne
structure components are therefore labeled as 2 2P1/2
and 2 2P3/2. Both of them split into two hyperﬁne levels
2 2P1/2 (F = 0 or 1) and 2 2P3/2 (F = 1 or 2).
Without nuclear spin interaction and without Lamb
shift (see Sect. 5.7.3) all levels of the H atom with equal
quantum numbers (n, j) have the same energy, because
the energy shift due to the relativistic increase of the
electron mass me and that due to spin-orbit coupling
just cancel. This (2 j + 1) fold degeneracy is lifted by
the hyperﬁne interaction, because the magnitude of
this interaction depends on the spatial distribution of
the electron density and is therefore different for dif-
ferent values of the quantum number l. Levels with
equal quantum numbers n and j but different val-
ues of l do experience different hyperﬁne shifts and
splittings.
In an external magnetic ﬁeld, each atomic state
(n,l, s, j) splits without hyperﬁne interaction into
2 j + 1 Zeeman components. The energy separation
of these components depends on the Lande fac-
tor g j (5.76), which might be different for the different
levels. Generally the Zeeman splittings of different
states are therefore different (anomalous Zeeman ef-
fect). For states with total electron spin S = 0 (which
can be only realized for atoms with an even number
of electrons) the normal Zeeman effect applies and the
total Zeeman splittings are equal for all states with
the same orbital angular momentum quantum number
l, while the energy difference between neighbouring
Zeeman levels is independent of l.
If the Zeeman splittings are small compared to
the hyperﬁne splittings (μ j · B  A j · I), the exter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld can not break the coupling between
electronic and nuclear magnetic moments. The to-
tal angular momentum including nuclear spin is then
the vector sum F = j + I, which has 2F + 1 pos-
sible orientations against the external magnetic ﬁeld
with different energies. Therefore the hyperﬁne levels
with the quantum number F split into 2F + 1 Zeeman
components.
For the ground state 12S1/2 of the H atom no
Zeeman splitting is observed for the HFS component
F = 0, while the other HFS component with F = 1
splits into three Zeeman sublevels (Fig. 5.31).
For higher magnetic ﬁelds (μ j · B > ΔEHFS) the
coupling between j and I breaks down. The quantum
number F is no longer deﬁned and the Zeeman shift of
the levels depends on μ j · B. For still higher magnet-
ic ﬁelds (μ j · B > ΔEFS) even the coupling between s
and l breaks down. In this case there is no longer a de-
ﬁned total electronic angular momentum j but l and s
precess separately around the ﬁeld axis (Paschen–Back
effect Fig. 5.32).
The complete level scheme of the H atom is shown
in Fig. 5.33 where, on the left side, the energy levels
without effects of the electron spin are plotted, which
are the energies obtained from Bohr’s atomic model
and also from the Schrödinger equation. The level en-
ergies plotted in the second column take into account
the relativistic mass increase and the ﬁne structure due
to spin-orbit coupling. The next column adds the Lamb
shift (see next section) and the last column includes the
hyperﬁne interaction.
Note that the energy scales for ﬁne and hyperﬁne
interactions are widely spread, in order to show these
small splittings in the same diagram. The absolute val-
ues for the splitting of the 2P1/2 level are illustrated in
Fig. 5.34.
Remark
In this chapter the electron spin was introduced in
a phenomenological way, based on the results of ex-
periments, such as the Einstein–de Haas effect, the ﬁne
structure in the atomic spectra and the Stern–Gerlach
experiment. Mathematically, the total wave function
was written as the product of spatial wave function
(solution of the Schrödinger equation) and spin func-
tion. This heuristic introduction of the electron spin is
able to explain all experimental results discussed so far,
although it does not meet the requirements of a strict
mathematical derivation.
A complete theory, including the electron spin ab
initio, was developed by Paul A.M. Dirac (1902–
1984) who used as a master equation, instead of the
Schrödinger equation, an equation that includes all rel-
ativistic effects (Dirac equation). This equation can be
solved analytically for all one-electron systems as long

5.7. Complete Description of the Hydrogen Atom

as they can be reduced to real one body systems (for
instance the treatment of the H atom can be reduced to
a one-body system, where one particle with the reduced
mass μ moves in the spherical symmetric Coulomb po-
tential). This treatment is no longer possible for the
two particle system e+e−(positronium consisting of
positron and electron) because the interaction between
the two spins of e+ and e−represents a strong pertur-
bation of the Coulomb potential (see Sect. 6.7.4).
5.7.3 Lamb Shift
An atom can absorb or emit electromagnetic radiation.
The correct description has to take into account the
interaction of this atom with the radiation ﬁeld. This
interaction is not only present during the absorption or
emission of photons, but also for so-called “virtual in-
teractions,” where the atomic electron in the Coulomb
ﬁeld of the nucleus can absorb and then emit a pho-
ton of energy ¯hω during a time interval Δt < ¯h/ΔE =
1/ω. The uncertainty relation ΔEΔt ≥¯h allows such
processes without violating the energy conservation
law.
This interaction leads to a small shift of the energy
levels (Lamb-shift), which depends on the spatial prob-
ability distribution of the electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld
of the nucleus and therefore on the quantum numbers n
and l.
The Lamb shift can be understood at least qual-
itatively by an illustrative simple model. Because of
the photon recoil, the statistical virtual absorption and
emission of photons results in a shaky movement of the
electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus (Fig. 5.35),
where its distance from the nucleus r varies in a random
way by δr. Its average potential energy is then

Its quantitative calculation is not possible within the
framework of the Schrödinger theory but can be per-
formed in an extended theory called quantum electro-
dynamics, which contains the complete description of
atoms and their electron shells including the interaction
with the radiation ﬁeld [5.3].

The effects of these interactions are generally very
small. Therefore, in most cases the Schrödinger theory,
including the electron spin, is sufﬁciently accurate to
match the experimental results. Only in special cases,
and in particular for high precision measurements, does
the Lamb shift have to be taken into account.
The complete term diagram of the levels with n =
2 in the H atom is drawn in Fig. 5.34. The Lamb
shift ΔEL is maximum for the S states, because the
wave function has a maximum at the position of the
nucleus and the effect of the random variations δr are
largest for small r values.

5. The Hydrogen Atom
The numerical values for the Lamb shifts are
ΔELa(12S1/2) = +3.55 × 10−5 eV
⇒ΔνLa = +8.176 GHz
ΔELa(22S1/2) = +4.31 × 10−6 eV
⇒ΔνLa = +1.056 GHz
ΔELa(22P1/2) = −5.98 × 10−8 eV
⇒ΔνLa = −14 MHz .
The ﬁrst measurement of the Lamb shift was per-
formed in 1947 by Willis Lamb (*1912) [5.4] and
Robert Retherford (*1912) using the experimental set-
up shown in Fig. 5.36.
In a heated tungsten oven, hydrogen is thermal-
ly dissociated. (In modern devices, a higher degree of
dissociation is achieved with a microwave discharge.)
The H atoms emerging from a hole in the oven in-
to the vacuum are collimated by the aperture B into
a nearly parallel atomic beam. The atoms are excit-
ed into the metastable 22S1/2 state by collisions with
electrons crossing the atomic beam. The lifetime of
the 2S state is about 1s and therefore longer than the
ﬂight time of the atoms through the apparatus. After
a pathlength L, the metastable atoms impinge onto
a tungsten target, where they transfer their excitation
energy, which is higher than the energy necessary to
release electrons from the conduction band, which are
collected by a detector. The rate of emitted electrons
represents a small electric current that can be measured.
During their ﬂight to the detector the electrons
pass a radio frequency ﬁeld with a tunable fre-
quency. If the frequency matches the energy separa-
tion
ΔE = E(22S1/2) −E(2P1/2) = 4.37 × 10−6 eV
(⇒νres = 1.05 × 109 Hz or λ = 30 cm) between the
22S1/2 state and the 22P1/2 state, transitions 22S1/2 →
22P1/2 are induced. The lifetime of the 22P1/2 state is
only τ ≈2 × 10−9 s, because it decays spontaneous-
ly into the 1S state by emitting Lyman-α radiation.
Therefore atoms in the 2P state cannot reach the de-
tector. Hydrogen atoms in the 1S ground state cannot
release electrons from the tungsten target. Therefore
the measured electron current decreases and I(νrf)
shows a sharp dip at the resonance radio frequency.
An alternative way for detecting the transitions
between the 22S1/2 and the 22P1/2 states is the mea-
surement of the Lyman α-ﬂuorescence emitted from
the 2P1/2 state. It can be detected with a solar blind
photomultiplier viewing the rf ﬁeld region.
The
numerical
value
νres = 1.05 × 109Hz =
1.05 GHz obtained from these experiments is in
good agreement with theory. However, recent, much
more accurate measurements, show that for a reliable
comparison with theory the charge distribution in the
proton, which affects the Lamb shift, must be known
more accurately than is presently possible from high
energy scattering experiments.

Note:
In real experiments [5.4] very small electric stray ﬁelds,
which are difﬁcult to eliminate completely, already
cause Stark shifts that are different for the 2S and the
2P levels. These shifts not only add to the Lamb shift
but can also mix the 2S and 2P levels, causing Lyman-
α emission without applying the rf ﬁeld. This effect can
be avoided by applying a static magnetic ﬁeld B, which
causes a Zeeman splitting and an increase of the en-
ergy separation between the 22S1/2 and 22P1/2 levels
(Fig. 5.37). Instead of tuning the rf ﬁeld, the magnet-
ic ﬁeld is now varied at a ﬁxed radio frequency until
the resonance is reached for transitions between the
Zeeman levels. This has the additional advantage that
the radiofrequency can always stay in resonance with
the rf resonator and therefore the rf ﬁeld amplitude in
the interaction zone is always constant at its maximum
value.
If the experiment is repeated at different radio fre-
quencies, the resonance will occur at different magnetic
ﬁelds B. Plotting the measured values of νrf as a func-
tion of B (Fig. 5.37b) allows the extrapolation towards
B = 0, which yields the ﬁeld-free Lamb shift.
While the Lamb–Retherford experiment measured
only the Lamb shift of the 2S state, a modern ver-
sion of Lamb shift measurement can also determine the
much larger Lamb shift of the 12S1/2 ground state [5.5].
It is based on the precise comparison of the frequen-
cies of two different optical transitions in the H atom
(Fig. 5.38):
Firstly the two-photon transition 12S1/2 →22S1/2,
which is only possible if two photons are simultaneous-
ly absorbed (see Sects. 7.2.6 and 10.5). And secondly,
the one-photon transition 22S1/2 →42P1/2.
According to the Schrödinger theory (and also the
Dirac theory) the relation

holds. Taking into account the Lamb shift (which is
negligible for the 42P1/2 level) we obtain for the actual
frequencies

known from the Lamb–Retherford experiment, the shift
of the 1S state can be determined from (5.92a).
The two-photon transition 1S →2S is excited by
two photons from the frequency-doubled output of
a dye laser, tuned to the optical frequency νL =
(1/4)ν(1S −2S) = (1/4)ν1. The Lamb shift of the 1S
ground state is then
ΔELa(1S) = 5ΔELa(2S) −h · (ν1 −4ν2) .

5.8 Correspondence Principle
For many qualitative results, estimates are sufﬁcient
and can save much of the time necessary for more de-
tailed calculations. Here, a correspondence principle,
formulated by Niels Bohr, is very useful. It illustrates
the relation between classical and quantum physical
quantities [5.7]. Its statements are as follows.
The predictions of quantum mechanics have to con-
verge against classical results for the limit of large
quantum numbers.
Selection rules for transitions between atomic
states are valid for all quantum numbers. This means
that rules obtained from classical considerations for
large quantum numbers must also be valid for quan-
tum mechanical selection rules for small quantum
numbers.
This correspondence principle allows a quantitative
relation between classical and quantum physics and
gives the validity area for a classical description and
its correspondence to a quantum mechanical model at
the borderline of the classical realm. We will illustrate
this using some examples.

quency of an electromagnetic wave emitted by an

quantum theory demands l = 0.
For large values of l and n both models con-
verge against l ≈[l(l + 1)]1/2 ≤[(n −1)n]1/2 ≈n
(because l ≤n −1).
3. For the limiting case of small frequencies (large
wavelengths) Planck’s radiation law converges
against the Rayleigh–Jeans law (see Sect. 3.1). The
mean energy of the black body radiation at the fre-
quency ν is ⟨E⟩= ⟨n⟩hν, where ⟨n⟩is the mean
population density of photons hν in a mode of the
radiation ﬁeld. From Planck’s formula we can see
that for ν →0, the energy converges as E →kT .
This gives
⟨n⟩hν →kT ⇒⟨n⟩→kT/(hν) .
(5.95c)
For hν  kT the mean photon density ⟨n⟩becomes
very large, and ⟨n⟩hν ≫hν. The quantum struc-
ture of the photon ﬁeld becomes less prominent,
because the energy E = ⟨n⟩hν is now a nearly con-
tinuous function of n and the classical model does
not differ much from the quantum mechanical one.
4. For
the
harmonic
oscillator,
the
probability
|ψn(R)|2 of ﬁnding the system in the nth vibra-
tional level at a distance R is for small quantum
numbers n very different for the classical and
the quantum mechanical models. However, for
large values of n the classical probability Pcl(R)
approaches more and more the average of |ψ(R)|2
(see Fig. 4.21).
The correspondence principle is particularly use-
ful for the discussion of selection rules for radiative
transitions between atomic or molecular levels (see
Chap. 7).
5.9 The Electron Model
and its Problems
We have learned so far that the electron has a rest
mass me = 9.1 × 10−31 kg, a negative electric charge
e = −1.6 × 10−19 Coulomb, a spin s with the absolute
value
|s| = 1

which can be mathematically treated like an angular
momentum, and a magnetic moment
|μs| = gsμB ≈2μB ,
which is related to the spin by
μs = −γs · s
with
γs = e/me .
Up to now we have neither discussed the size of the
electron, nor the spatial mass and charge distribution.
In a simple classical model, one assumes that the
electron can be described by a charged sphere where
the mass is uniformly distributed over the volume of
this sphere and, because of the electric repulsion be-
tween charges of equal sign, the charge is uniformly
distributed over its surface (Fig. 5.39). The radius re of
this sphere (the classical electron radius) can then be
calculated as follows.
The capacity of the charged surface is
C = 4πε0re .
(5.95e)
In order to bring a total charge Q = −e onto this
capacitor, one needs the energy
W = 1
2 Q2/C = 1
2e2/C = e2/(8πε0re) = Epot .
(5.95f)
This potential energy corresponds to the energy W =
1
2ε0|E|2 of the static electric ﬁeld produced by the
charged electron. If this energy equals the mass ener-
gy mec2 of the electron, the classical electron radius
becomes
re =
e2
8πε0mec2 = 1.4 × 10−15 m .
(5.96a)
If the charge is not only on the surface of the sphere
but is uniformly distributed over the volume, an ana-
logue consideration yields twice the energy, i.e., W =
e2/(4πε0re) and a radius
Fig. 5.39.

face charge −e, spin s and
magnetic moment μs

4πε0mec2
= 2.8 × 10−15 m .
(5.96b)
In this model the magnetic moment μs of the elec-
tron is produced by the rotating charge. The elementary
calculation gives the relation
μs = 1
3ω · e · r2
e with μs = |⃗μs|
(5.97)
between μs and the angular rotation frequency ω.
Inserting
the
absolute
value
μs = 2μB = 1.85 ×
10−23 Am2, obtained from the Einstein–de Haas ex-
periment and the classical electron radius re = 1.4 ×
10−15 m, yields the angular frequency
ω = 3μs
e · r2e
= 1.7 × 1026 s−1 .
(5.98)
This would result in a velocity at the equator of the
sphere of
v = ωre = 2.3 × 1011 m/s ≫c = 3 × 108 m/s!!
(5.99)
This is clearly a problematic result.
A similar result is obtained, in contradiction to spe-
cial relativity, when the electron spin is interpreted as
mechanical angular momentum of a sphere with the
classical electron radius.
The moment of inertia of the sphere is I = 2

and the angular momentum
|s| = 1

(5.102)
Inserting the numerical values yields
v = 9 × 108 m/s > c = 3 × 108 m/s .
From high energy scattering experiments it can be con-
cluded that the charge e of the electron is localized
within a smaller volume with r < 10−16 m. The re-
sultant smaller value of r would, however, increase

5.9. The Electron Model and its Problems
197
the discrepancies of this mechanical model even more,
because a smaller re in the denominator of the expres-
sion (5.102) would further increase the equator velocity
v ∝1/re.
Apparently the mechanical model of the elec-
tron as a charged sphere and the interpretation
of its spin as mechanical angular momentum
must be wrong. Up to now there does not exist
a convincing realistic model of the electron.
The high energy experiments and precision mea-
surements of the magnetic spin moment indicate that
the electron can be treated as a point-like charge. Its
mass me = E/c2 can be interpreted as the energy E of
the electric ﬁeld produced by its charge −e. The spin
is an additional characteristic of the electron. Although
it follows the same mathematical relations as other an-
gular momenta, such as the commutation relations, and
it has the properties of a vector, it apparently cannot
be regarded as a mechanical angular momentum in the
classical sense.
The charge distribution
dq(r, ϑ, ϕ) = Ωel(r, ϑ, ϕ) dτ
= −e|ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ)|2 · r2 sin ϑ dr dϑ dϕ
of the electron in the atomic electron shell gives the
probability to ﬁnd the (probable point-like electron) in
the volume element dτ around the location (r, ϑ, ϕ).
These considerations illustrate a general problem
in the realm of microparticles. Is the distinction be-
tween particles with mass m and ﬁeld energy E = mc2
still meaningful? What are the lower limits of volumes
ΔV = Δx · Δy · Δz in space, where our geometrical
concept of space is still valid? Do we have to go to
a higher dimensional space when we want to describe
elementary particles?
There have been several attempts to answer these
questions, but a deﬁnite indisputable model has not yet
been developed. There are, however, mathematical the-
ories which are consistent with all experimental results,
although they do not provide a clear and vivid picture
of the electron.
The Dirac theory starts from a relativistic equa-
tion (the Dirac equation) that describes all properties
of the electron correctly (except its self-interaction
with its radiation ﬁeld resulting in the Lamb shift).
Analogous to the situation for the Schrödinger equation
the Dirac equation cannot be derived in a mathematical
way from ﬁrst physical principles. The complete the-
ory that includes all aspects of atomic and molecular
physics is quantum electrodynamics (QED) [5.8–10].
Its introduction is, however, beyond the scope of this
book.

•
The three-dimensional Schrödinger equation for
the hydrogen atom can be separated in the center-
of-mass system into three one-dimensional equa-
tions. This is possible because of the spher-
ically symmetric potential. The solutions of
the Schrödinger equation are wave functions
ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) = R(r)!(ϑ)"(ϕ), which can be writ-
ten as the product of three functions of only one
variable. While the radial part R(r) depends on the
special r-dependence of the potential, the angular
part Y m
l (ϑ, ϕ) = !(ϑ)"(ϕ) represents spherical
surface harmonics Y m
l
for all spherical poten-
tials. These functions depend only on the quantum
numbers l of the orbital angular momentum l
and ml of its projection lz.
•
The constraints of normalization and unambigui-
ty for the wave function lead to the quantization
of bound energy states with E < 0 (only discrete
energy levels exist) while for states with E > 0
all energies are allowed (continuous states). One
can also say that if the wave function is restricted
to a ﬁnite volume in space, the energies are quan-
tized. If the particle can move all over the space,
a continuous energy spectrum appears.
•
Each wave function ψ = ψn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ) of the
H atom is unambiguously deﬁned by the three
quantum numbers n (principal quantum number),
l (quantum number of orbital angular momen-
tum l) and ml (projection quantum number of lz).
•
The absolute square |ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ)|2 of the wave
function describes the probability density func-
tion. This means, that |ψ|2 dV gives the probabil-
ity to ﬁnd the particle within the volume dV .
•
The energy eigenvalues En are obtained by insert-
ing the wave functions ψn,l,m into the Schrödinger
equation.
•
Within the Schrödinger model the energies En of
the discrete states of the hydrogen atom depend
solely on n, not on l and m. All states with equal n
but different values of l or m have the same ener-
gy (they are degenerate). For each possible value
of En there are k = -n−1
l=0 (2l + 1) = n2 differ-
ent wave functions ψn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ) that describe n2
different spatial charge distributions of the elec-
tron. The energy states of the hydrogen atom are
therefore n2-fold degenerate.
•
The normal Zeeman effect results from the in-
teraction of the magnetic moment μl (due to the
orbital motion of the electron) with an external
magnetic ﬁeld. This interaction splits the energy
states En,l into (2l + 1) equidistant Zeeman com-
ponents with energies shifted by ΔE = μBml B
against the ﬁeld-free energies, where μB is the
Bohr magneton.
•
Several experimental results (anomalous Zeeman
effect, Stern–Gerlach experiment, Einstein–de
Haas experiment) force an extension of the Schrö
dinger theory. This was achieved by the intro-
duction of the electron spin ⃗s with an additional
spin magnetic moment μs = −gs(μB/h)s with
the Lande factor gs ≈2. The total angular mo-
mentum of the electron is the vector sum j =
l + s. The total wave function is now written as
a product of the spatial part and a spin function.
•
The ﬁne structure, observed in the atomic spectra,
can be interpreted as Zeeman splitting, caused by
the interaction of the spin magnetic moment μs
with the internal magnetic ﬁeld, produced by the
orbital motion of the electron. The energies of the
ﬁne structure components are
En,l, j = En + a
2[ j( j + 1) −l(l + 1) −s(s + 1)] ,
where
a = μ0Ze2 ¯h2
8πm2er3
is the spin-orbit coupling constant.
•
In the Coulomb potential all energy terms with
equal quantum number j are degenerate when the
Lamb-shift is neglected. This is due to the can-
cellation of the energy shift due to the relativistic
increase of the electron mass and the shift caused
by the spin-orbit interaction. This degeneracy is
lifted in non-Coulombic potentials, even if they
are spherically symmetric, because here the two
shifts are different. It is furthermore lifted by the
Lamb-shift.
•
The anomalous Zeeman effect is observed for
all states with total spin S ̸= 0: and total orbital
angular momentum L ̸= 0. The energy shift
of the Zeeman components is ΔE = −μ j · B,

Summary
199
with μ j = μl + μs. Each term En, j splits into
(2 j + 1) Zeeman components, which are gener-
ally not equidistant as for the normal Zeeman
effect.
•
Atoms with a nuclear spin I and a corresponding
(very small) nuclear magnetic moment μN show
an additional small energy shift ΔE = −μN · B
of the atomic states, caused by the interaction
of the nuclear magnetic moment with the inter-
nal magnetic ﬁeld produced by the electrons at
the position of the nucleus (hyperﬁne structure).
The energy levels split into (2F + 1) hyperﬁne-
components, where F is the quantum number of
the total angular momentum F = J + I = L +
S + I, including the nuclear spin I.
•
If the interaction of the electron with the ra-
diation ﬁeld produced by virtual emission and
absorption of photons is taken into account, the
energy levels experience a small additional shift,
called the Lamb shift. The shift is maximum for
the 1S state, smaller for the 2S state and negligi-
ble for the P or D states. The Lamb shift can only
be calculated within the framework of quantum
electrodynamics.
•
The Schrödinger theory describes the hydrogen
atom correctly if relativistic effects (mass increase
and electron spin) are neglected. The Dirac theory
includes these effects, but does not take into ac-
count the Lamb shift. A complete description of
all effects observed so far, is possible within the
quantum electrodynamic theory.
•
Up to now no concrete model of the electron exists
that consistently describes all characteristics such
as mass, size, charge, spin and magnetic moment.

6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
In atoms with more than one electron additional prob-
lems arise that are caused by mutual electrostatic and
magnetic interactions between the electrons. In ad-
dition, we are now confronted with new symmetry
principles that are valid if two electrons are exchanged.
These stem from the fact that electrons cannot be
distinguished from each other.
We will ﬁrst study these phenomena for the heli-
um atom, which represents the simplest system with
two electrons. This will help us understand the build-
ing up principle for the structure of electron shells for
larger atoms. We will see that the electron conﬁgura-
tions for all atoms can be obtained from the minimum
energy principle, the correct coupling of the different
angular momenta of the electrons and the observation
of certain symmetry rules. This results in the determi-
nation of all possible energy states of the atoms and the
characterization of these states by quantum numbers.
6.1 The Helium Atom
The helium atom consists of a nucleus with charge
+Ze = +2e and mass mK ≈4mH and of two elec-
trons each with charge q = −e. The spatial distri-
bution of the two electrons depends on their wave
function ψ(r1, r2), which is a function of the spa-
tial coordinates r1 = (x1, y1, z1) and r2 = (x2, y2, z2)
of the two electrons. Their distances from the nucleus
are r1 = |r1| and r2 = |r2| and their mutal distance is
r12 = |r1 −r2|.
The potential energy of the electrons is then:

with

(6.1b)
where the operator Δi acts on the coordinate ri.
Since mK ≈7300 me, we can use the approximation

The last term on the left side is the potential ener-
gy, which is no longer spherically symmetric as in
the hydrogen atom, but depends on the angle α be-
tween the radius vectors ri to the electrons, because
of their mutual repulsion. From Fig. 6.1 we can derive
the relation

6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
the Schrödinger equation (6.2) is no longer solvable
analytically and we have to use approximations.
6.1.1 Approximation Models
Because of the mutual repulsion, the charge distribu-
tion of the electrons will be such, that the total energy
becomes a minimum. This means: The sum of kinet-
ic energy and potential energy, due to electron-electron
repulsion and attraction between the electrons and the
nucleus becomes a minimum. On the time average is
⟨r12⟩> ⟨r1⟩= ⟨r2⟩.
In a ﬁrst crude approximation we can therefore ne-
glect the last term in (6.1a). Then we can separate the
wave function into the product
ψ(r1, r2) = ψ1(r1)ψ2(r2) .
(6.3)
Inserting this into the Schrödinger equation (6.2) yields
two separate equations for the two electrons

(6.4)
with E1 + E2 = E. Each of these equations is identical
to the Schrödinger eqation (5.8) for the one electron
system and can be solved accordingly.
With Z = 2 we obtain in this approximation for
the energy of the two electrons in the lowest state with
n = 1:
EHe(1s) = −2Z2EH = −2 · 4 · 13.6 eV
= −108.8 eV .
The experimental value for this energy that is necessary
to remove both electrons from the atom (this means to
convert the He atom into the doubly charged ion He++)
is, however, only Eexp = 78.98 eV.
The neglection of the electron repulsion therefore
introduces an absolute error of 30 eV, i.e., a relative
error of about 40%.
A much better approximation is obtained by a mod-
el that assumes that each of the two electrons moves in
the Coulomb potential of the nucleus, shielded by the
charge distribution of the other electron (which is as-
sumed to have a spherically symmetric time average).
The resulting potential for each electron is then a
spherically symmetric Coulomb potential generated by

nuclear charge +Ze by the nega-
tive charge distribution ρel(e2) =
−e|ψ1s(r2)|2 of a 1s electron
the effective charge Qeff = (Z −S)e (Fig. 6.2). The
quantity S (0 ≤S ≤1) is called the shielding constant.
For total shielding S = 1 and one would need the
energy EH to remove the ﬁrst electron from the atom.
The remaining ion He+ now has the nuclear charge
+2e and the binding energy of the second electron is
therefore −Z2EH = −4EH. The total ionization ener-
gy of the He atom is then
EHe(1s) = −EH −4EH = −5EH = −68 eV ,
(6.5)
which comes much closer to the experimental val-
ue EHe = −78.983 eV. For a shielding constant S =
0.656 the experimental value is exactly reproduced. In
our model the correct energy is therefore obtained for
an effective nuclear charge of Zeffe = +1.344 e. This
implies that about 33% of the real nuclear charge +2e
is shielded for one electron by the other electron in the
1s state.
Note:
The shielding for an electron in higher energy states
(for instance the 2s or 2p state) by an 1s electron can
be much larger, because the spatial charge distribution
for the higher state has only small values within the 1s
distribution of the shielding electron.
The spatial charge distribution of the shielding
electron in the 1s state is given by
ϱel = −eψ∗
2 (1s)ψ2(1s) .

Inserting this expression into the Schrödinger equation
gives a much better value for the energy of the heli-
um ground state than by inserting the shielding factor
S = 1. In addition the shielding is now dependent on
the distance r1 of the electron e1 from the nucleus. This
is reasonable because the more the electron e1 pene-
trates into the charge distribution of e2, the lower the
shielding by e2 becomes.
6.1.2 Symmetry of the Wave Function
We will label the two electrons e1 and e2. The two
factors ψ1(n1,l1, ml1) and ψ2(n2,l2, ml2) of the sepa-
rated wave function (6.3) depend on the three quantum
numbers (n.l, ml) of the two electrons, which we will
abbreviate with
a = (n1,l1, ml1)
and
b = (n2,l2, ml2) .
The
probability
P(a, b) = |Ψab(r1,r2)|2,
that
the
atomic state (a, b) is realized, (this means that e1 is in
state a and e2 in state b) can be expressed in the approx-
imate model of independent electrons (the interaction
term e2/r12 is neglected) by the absolute square of the
product function (6.3)

Fig. 6.3. The two-electron conﬁgurations are undistinguish-

If we exchange the two electrons (Fig. 6.3), (e1 is
now in state b and e2 in state a) our product function
becomes
ψII
ab = ψ2(a)ψ1(b) .
(6.10b)
However, the two electrons are indistinguishable! This
means that the charge distribution of the total atom
should not be changed under exchange of the two
electrons. We can write this as
**ψI
ab
**2 =
**ψII
ab
**2 ⇒ψI
ab = eiϕψII
ab .
(6.11)
Applying the permutation of the two electrons twice
brings the state back into its original conﬁguration.
This demands ϕ = 0 or ϕ = π ⇒
ψI
ab = ±ψII
ab .
(6.12)
Neither of the two functions ψI nor ψII fullﬁll this
condition. They therefore cannot represent the correct
eigenfunctions for the description of our atomic state.
We can, however, form a symmetric and an antisym-
metric linear combination of these product functions,
which obey the condition (6.12):
ψs
atom = ψ1(a)ψ2(b) + ψ2(a)ψ1(b)
(6.13a)
ψa
atom = ψ1(a)ψ2(b) −ψ2(a)ψ1(b) .
(6.13b)
The symmetric function ψs
atom reproduces itself un-
der exchange of the two electrons, while ψa
atom only
changes its sign.
Note:
ψs and ψa represent the probability amplitudes for the
conﬁguration that one electron is in state a and the oth-
er in state b. However, we do not know which of the
two electrons is in a and which is in b. This problem is
quite analogous to the situation in Young’s double slit

204
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
experiment (see Sect. 3.5.2), where the probability of
ﬁnding a photon on the screen behind the double slit is
given by the absolute square of the sum of two proba-
bility amplitudes. In a similar way the probability for
the realization of an atomic state where one electron
is in state a and the other in state b is given either
by
**ψs
atom
**2 or by
**ψa
atom
**2. Which of the two func-
tions gives the correct description of the atomic state
depends on the total electron spin of this state, as will
be explained below.
If both electrons are in the same state (a = b), we
obtain from (6.13b)
ψa
atom = ψ1(a)ψ2(a) −ψ2(a)ψ1(a) ≡0 .
(6.14)
This means: The probability to ﬁnd two electrons with
parallel spins in the same state (n,l, ml) is zero.
Two electrons with the same quantum numbers
(n,l, ml) are described by the symmetric spatial
wave function ψs
atom.
6.1.3 Consideration of the Electron Spin
Based on the experimental facts (ﬁne structure and the
anomalous Zeeman effect) described in the preceding
chapter we know that each electron has a spin s with a
value |s| = √s(s + 1)h, where the spin quantum num-
ber s takes the value s = +1/2 and a component sz =
msh where the spin projection quantum number ms can
only have the values ms = +1/2 or ms = −1/2. We
will describe these two possible spin orientations by
spin functions χ+(ms = +1/2) and χ−(ms = −1/2).
The correct mathematical description of these func-
tions, which are represented by vectors with two com-
ponents (spinors), is not important for the following
considerations.
The spin state of the atom where both electrons have
parallel spins must be described by symmetric spin
functions. There are 3 possible ways to form symmetric
spin functions:
χs
1(1, 2) = c1χ+(1)χ+(2)
and
χs
2(1, 2) = c2χ−(1)χ−(2) ,

which describe atomic states with total electron spin

spin quantum number S = 1, and the total spin projec-
tion quantum number Ms = ms1 + ms2 = 0, ±1.

6.1. The Helium Atom
205
The total electron spin S with S = 1 has three
possible projections onto the quantization axis
with quantum numbers MS = 0, ±1. If the elec-
tron spin interacts with other angular momenta
or with external ﬁelds, the corresponding atomic
state splits into three components. We therefore
name such states triplet states.
The antisymmetric wave function
χa = χ+(1)χ−(2) −χ+(2)χ−(1)
(6.17)
represents an atomic state with total electron spin-
quantum number S = 0 and therefore MS = 0, which
we call a singlet state (Fig. 6.4b).
The total wave function of an atomic state can now
be written as the product
ψtotal = ψab(r1, ϑ1, ϕ1,r2, ϑ2, ϕ2) · χ(S, MS)
(6.18)
of the spatial wave function ψ(r, ϑ, ϕ) that is de-
termined by the two sets of quantum numbers a =
(n1,l1, ml1) and b = (n2,l2, ml2), and the spin wave
function χ(S, MS), which depends on the quantum
number S of the total electron spin S = s1 + s2 and the
quantum number MS = ms1 + ms2 of the projection
Mz = MS ¯h.
Note:
This separation into the product (6.18) is only possi-
ble if the interaction between the spin and the orbital
angular momentum can be neglected (see Sect. 6.5).
6.1.4 The Pauli Principle
The observation and the analysis of the helium spec-
trum (see next section) and of many other atoms with
more than one electron brought the following surpris-
ing result.
The only atomic states that are observed in nature
are described by total wave functions (spatial function
times spin function) that are antisymmetric against a
permutation of two electrons.
Based on these experimental results and on fun-
damental symmetry arguments Wolfgang Pauli (1900–
1958) (Fig. 6.5) postulated the general symmetry rule
in 1925 (called the Pauli principle):
Fig. 6.5.
Wolfgang
Pauli
(1900–1958)
From:
E.
Bagge: Die Nobelpreisträger

Heinz
Moos-
Verlag, München, 1964
The total wave function of a system with more
than one electron is always antisymmetric with
repect to an exchange of two electrons.
Up until now, no exception to this rule has been
found!
A more involved theoretical treatment of systems
with identical particles shows that this Pauli principle
is valid for all particles with spin quantum number s =
(n + 1/2) (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .). Such particles are called
Fermions, whereas particles with integer spin quantum
number s are called Bosons.
The Pauli principle is therefore also valid for pro-
tons and neutrons (both have a nuclear spin quantum
number of 1/2).
If two electrons of an atom are both in the same
state described by the spatial wave function ψn,l,m, (this
means that they have the same quantum numbers n, l,
and ml), their antisymmetric spatial wave functions be-
comes, according to (6.14), zero. This implies that such
a state has to be described by a spatial wave function
that is symmetric against exchange of two electrons.
Since the Pauli principle demands that the total wave
function has to be antisymmetric, it follows that the
spin wave function must be antisymmetric and can be
described by (6.17). The two spin projections ms1 ¯h
and ms2 ¯h must differ in their sign.
In other words, two electrons with the same quan-
tum numbers n,l, ml must have different spin pro-
jection quantum numbers ms1 ̸= ms2! When we de-
scribe an atomic state by the four quantum numbers
(n,l, ml, ms) for each electron we can formulate the
Pauli principle as:

206

Ms =0
An atomic state characterized by the set of four
quantum numbers (n,l, ml, ms) can be occupied
by at most one electron.
or:
An atomic state with the three quantum numbers
(n,l, ml), can be occupied by at most two elec-
trons with opposite spin orientations ms = +1/2
and ms = −1/2 (Fig. 6.6).
6.1.5 Energy Levels of the Helium Atom
The lowest energy level of the He atom (ground state) is
obtained if both electrons have the lowest possible prin-
cipal quantum number n = 1. The other quantum num-
bers must then be l = 0 and ml = 0. The two electrons
now have identical quantum numbers (n,l, ml) of the
spatial wave function and therefore their spin quantum
numbers ms1 = +1/2 ̸= ms2 = −1/2 must be differ-
ent. Since the spatial wave function is symmetric, the
spin function must be antisymmetric. For the total spin
we get S = s1 + s2 = 0. Both spins are antiparallel
and MS = ms1 + ms2 = 0. The helium ground state is
a singlet state. The state does not split in an external
magnetic ﬁeld but has only one Zeeman component be-
cause its total angular momentum and therefore also its
magnetic moment are zero.
The number 2S + 1 of possible orientations MS of
the total spin S is called the multiplicity of the atomic
state. The multiplicity of an atomic state is written as an
upper index in front of the symbol for the total orbital
angular momentum. Each atomic state is character-
ized by the symbol nS+1L J, where n is the principal
quantum number, L the quantum number of the to-
tal orbital angular momentum ⃗L = ⃗l1 + ⃗l2 (apart from
spin) and J the quantum number of the total angular
momentum ⃗J = ⃗L + ⃗S including the spin.
The helium ground state is then labeled as the 11S0
state (n = 1, 2S + 1 = 1, L = 0 and J = 0).
The helium atom can be excited into higher elec-
tronic states by absorption of photons or by electron
impact or by collisions with other particles, if their
energy is sufﬁciently high. If one electron, say e1, is
Fig. 6.7. Symbolic representation of the quantum numbers n, L and S for the ground state and some excited states of the
helium atom. The electron e1 is always in the 1S ground state

6.1. The Helium Atom
207
excited into a state with n = 2 and the other electron e2
stays in the lower state with n = 1, the quantum num-
ber l1 can take the values l1 = 0 or l1 = 1. Since the
principle quantum numbers n1 = 2 and n2 = 1 differ,
all other quantum numbers can be the same for the two
electrons or they can differ (see Fig. 6.7). Therefore the
following excited states of the He atom can be realized
for n1 = 2 and (n2 = 1, l2 = 0, ml2 = 0, ms2 = +1/2):
21S0

l1 = 0, ml1 = 0, ms1 = −1

.
While the ground state 1S0 of the helium atom
must be a singlet state according to the Pauli prin-
ciple, the excited states can be either singlet or
triplet states.
Because of spin-orbit coupling (see Sects. 5.6.2
and 6.5) all triplet states with the spin quantum num-
ber S = 1 and the orbital quantum number L ≥1 split
into three ﬁne structure components that differ in the
quantum number J of the total angular momentum
J = l1 + l2 + s1 + s2 (Fig. 6.8).
The magnitude of the splitting and the energetic
order of the ﬁne structure components depend on the
kind and strength of the coupling between the different
angular momenta (see Sect. 6.5).
The level system of the helium atom therefore con-
sists of a singlet system (single components with S =
0 ⇒J = L) and a triplet system with S = 1 (Fig. 6.9).
The energy of the singlet levels is quite different
from that of the triplet levels with the same quantum
numbers (n,l, ml). The reason for this difference is
not the magnetic interaction of the spin-orbit coupling
(which only causes small ﬁne structure splittings), but
a consequence of the Pauli principle. For example, the
energetic difference between the 21S0 level and the
Fig. 6.8. Fine structure of the 23P state compared with the
unsplit 23S1 state of the helium atom
23S0 level is ΔE = E(1S0) −E(3S0) = 0.78 eV! The
23S level is described by the antisymmetric spatial
wave function, where the mutual time-averaged dis-
tance ⟨r12⟩between the two electrons is larger than
in the 21S state, where the electrons can come much
closer together since the spatial wave function is, even
for r12 = 0, not equal to zero. The time-averaged elec-
trostatic repulsion between the two electrons

is therefore larger in the 21S state than in the 23S state.
This pushes the energy of the 21S state above that of
the 23S state. A second reason is, that the shielding of
the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld by the electrons is smaller
in the triplet state, because the two electrons are farther
apart. This increases the attraction between nucleus and
electrons and decreases the energy.
Note:
While this explanation is correct for the S states the
situation is more complex for the P states. Detailed
calculations [6.1] have shown that for the 3P state the
average distance between the two electrons is smaller
than for the 1P state, which implies that the positive
Coulomb repulsion energy is larger in the 3P state than
in the 1P state. The reason for the lower total energy
of the 3P state is that for both electrons the average
distance from the nucleus is smaller, which gives a
larger negative potential energy of the electrons in the
3P state. This second effect overcompensates the ﬁrst
effect.
6.1.6 Helium Spectrum
The spectrum of the helium atom consists of all allowed
transitions between two arbitrary energy levels Ei, Ek
(see Chap. 7). For all excited states where only one
of the two electrons is excited only this electron is in-
volved in such a transition, the other stays in the ground
state. The energy of the absorbed or emitted photons is
hνik = Ei −Ek ⇒λik =
hc
Ei −Ek
(6.19)
(Fig. 6.10). However, not every transition obeying the
energy relation (6.19) is actually observed in the spec-
trum, because certain selection rules exist (see Chap. 7)
for possible transitions. For the Helium atom with the
total orbital angular momentum L = l1 + l2, the to-
tal spin S = s1 + s2 and the total electronic angular
momentum J = L + S these selection rules can be ex-
pressed by the corresponding quantum numbers L, S
and J:
Only those transitions are allowed for which the
selection rules
ΔL = ±1; ΔML = 0, ±1; ΔS = 0; ΔJ = 0 or ±1
except for J = 0 ↔J = 0

are fulﬁlled. Transitions between two levels with J = 0
are forbidden.
These selection rules just reﬂect the conservation
of angular momenta of the system atom + absorbed or
emitted photon.
According to these selection rules, transitions be-
tween the singlet system (S = 0) and the triplet system
(S = 1) are forbidden.
For transitions between triplet levels with L ≥1,
more than three components are often observed, as can
be seen from Fig. 6.11, which shows the six possible
transitions between the ﬁne structure components of
33D and 23P levels.

line positions and the ﬁne structure (Fig. 6.10) the
two spectra were initially regarded as originating from
different kinds of atoms. Because the chemical anal-
ysis had unambiguously identiﬁed both systems as
belonging to helium, it was believed that two kinds
of helium might exist, which were named para-helium
and ortho-helium.
Today we know that there exists only one kind of
helium and that the difference in the spectra stems from
the different total electron spin S = s1 + s2. For para-
helium the total spin quantum number is S = 0 and for
ortho-helium it is S = 1.
6.2 Building-up Principle of the
Electron Shell for Larger Atoms
Since the Pauli principle does not allow more than two
electrons in the 1s state with n = 1, the additional elec-
trons in atoms with more than two electrons have to
occupy higher energy states with n ≥2 even in the
lowest energy state (ground state) of these atoms.
The population of electrons in atoms with energy
levels (n,l, ml, ms) occurs in such a way that
1. The Pauli principle is obeyed and
2. The total energy of all electrons is minimum for the
atomic ground state.
It is remarkable that the structure of the electron
shells of all existing atomic elements can be explained
by these two principles. In particular, the arrangement
of the elements in the periodic table postulated by
D. Mendelejew 1869 and indepently by L. Meyer 1870
by comparing the chemical properties of the elements,
follows quite naturally from these principles in a very
satisfactory way. It explains the periodic table using
the structure of the atomic electron shells, governed by
these two principles.
Without the Pauli principle the electron shells of
all atoms would collapse into the 1s shell with
the lowest energy. One can therefore say: The
Pauli principle guarantees the stability of atoms
and the great variety of chemical properties of the
different elements.
We will explain these general remarks by some
speciﬁc examples.
6.2.1 The Model of Electron Shells
The radial distributions of atomic electrons, according
to Sect. 5.1.4, is given by
P(r) = r2|Rn,l(r)|2 ,
where Rn,l(r) is the radial part of the wave function
for an electron with principal quantum number n and
orbital angular momentum quantum number l.
We discussed in Sect. 4.3 that for each value
of l there are (2l + 1) degenerate wave functions Y m
l ,
with different quantum numbers ml, describing dif-
ferent angular distributions. For each value of the
principal quantum n there are n possible values l =
0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1 of the angular momentum quantum
number. Therefore, there are
n−1
.
l=0
(2l + 1) = n2
(6.21)
different states described by the wave functions
ψn,l,m(r, ϑ, ϕ) that can be occupied by at most 2n2
electrons with pairs of opposite spins, according to the
Pauli principle.

is obtained by summation over the squares of all pos-
sible wave functions with l < n and −l ≤ml ≤+l,
where C is a normalization factor. This gives a spheri-
cally symmetric charge distribution, as can be seen by
summing over all squared spherical harmonics Y m
l
for
a given value of n. This charge distribution has maxi-
ma at certain values of the distance r from the nucleus,
which solely depend on the principal quantum number
n. The main part of the electron charge is contained
within the spherical shell between the radii r −Δr/2
and r + Δr/2 (Fig. 6.12). Such a spherically symmet-
ric charge distribution is called an electron shell. The
different shells are labeled as follows:
n = 1 : K-shell ,
n = 4 : N-shell
n = 2 : L-shell ,
n = 5 : O-shell
n = 3 : M-shell ,
n = 6 : P-shell
Each of these electron shells has, including the electron
spin, 2n2 states (n,l, ml, ms), where each of these states

210
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
Fig. 6.12. Radial electron density distribution for fully occu-
pied shells with n = 1, 2 and 3
can be occupied by at most one electron. Some of these
states can be degenerate (for instance all 2l + 1 levels
of a given l-value are degenerate without an external
magnetic ﬁeld).
According to the Pauli principle each electron
shell can be occupied by at most 2n2 electrons.
Since the radial wave function for non-Coulomb
potentials also depends on the angular momentum
quantum number l (Fig. 6.13), one calls the arrange-
ment of all electrons with given values of n and l
a subshell (Table 6.1).
For each value of n there are n different values
of l and therefore n subshells.

according to the Pauli principle is illustrated in
Fig. 6.14 for the ground states of atoms with the ten
smallest values of Z from hydrogen (Z = 1) to neon
(Z = 10). The two possible spin states ms = ±1/2 are
symbolized by upwards or downwards arrows. Fully
occupied states are marked as dark blue, states with
only one electron as light blue and unoccupied states
as white.
For lithium, with Z = 3, the third electron can-
not occupy the K-shell (1s), because there are already
two electrons. It has to be in the next highest ener-
gy L-subshell 2s with n = 2 and l = 0. The electron
conﬁguration of the Li atom is then (1s)2(2s), where

the exponent gives the number of electrons in the
corresponding subshell. The quantum numbers of the
third electron are n = 2; l = 0, ml = 0; ms = ±1/2
and the Li ground state is labeled as 22S1/2 (see
Sect. 6.1.4).
The fourth electron in the beryllium atom can
still occupy the 2s state (n = 2; l = 0; ml = 0; ms =
−1/2) if the spin quantum number ms differs from that
of the third electron. The ground state of the Be atom
is therefore 21S0.
For the ﬁfth electron in the boron atom the state 2s
is already occupied and it has to go into the 2p state
with n = 2 and l = 1. The ground state of B is then
22P1/2.
The next two electrons for the elements carbon C
and nitrogen N still ﬁt into the subshell 2p with l = 1
and ml = 0, ±1. It turns out that the lowest energy is
realized, if the three electrons have parallel spins. The
reason for this rule is that the spatial wave functions
for electrons with parallel spins are antisymmetric (see
Sect. 6.1.4) and describe an electron distribution where
the electrons are farther apart than for symmetric wave
functions. Therefore their mutual Coulomb repulsion is
smaller and the energy is lower. This is summarized in
Hund’s rule:
For every atomic ground state, the total electron
spin has the maximum value tolerated by the
Pauli principle.
The quantum numbers (L, S, and J) of the atomic
ground states are determined by the total orbital an-
gular momentum L = - li, the total spin S = - si
and their coupling to J = L + S. The ground state
of C is then 23P0 because |⃗L| = |⃗l1 + ⃗l2| = 1¯h, and
of N it is 24S3/2 because - ⃗li = ⃗0. For the next three
atoms O, F and Ne the three additional electrons still
ﬁt into the 2p shell, but according to the Pauli princi-
ple, their spins must be opposite to that of the three
electrons, already occupying this subshell. The total
spin quantum number therefore decreases from oxy-
gen (S = 1) to ﬂuorine (S = 1/2) to neon (S = 0). For
neon the L-shell with n = 2 is fully occupied. The to-
tal orbital angular momentum is L = -li = 0 and the
total spin S = - si = 0. The time-averaged electron
charge distribution for neon is spherically symmetric.
The spectroscopic labels of the ground states of the ﬁrst
ten elements are given in Fig. 6.14.
With sodium (Z = 11) the building-up of the
M-shell with n = 3 starts, until eight electrons ﬁll this

M-shell, which is still not fully occupied for argon
with Z = 18 because the d subshell is not yet occu-
pied (Table 6.2). The analysis of the atomic spectra
proves that with potassium (Z = 19) in the ﬁrst row
of the third period in the periodic table the building
up of the 4s shell starts, which is fully occupied for
calcium (Z = 20) before the 3d shell is ﬁlled. The rea-
son for this apparent deviation from the regular scheme
stems from the fact that the 3d electrons are, on av-
erage, farther away from the atomic nucleus than the
4s electrons. Therefore their energy is higher and the
principle of energy minimization favors the 4s elec-
trons. Indeed extensive computer calculations of the
total energy Etotal prove that Etotal of the electron shell
of K and Ca is smaller if the 4s shell is ﬁlled instead of
the 3d shell.
In Fig. 6.17 the successive building-up of the dif-
ferent electron shells is illustrated by an arrow diagram
(without taking into account the peculiarity for Cu,
where electrons are rearranged within a subshell).
This model of atomic electron shells can explain
all peculiarities in the periodic table such as the group
of rare earth elements, sitting all in the same row of
the table. Here inner shells 4 f and 5d are successively
ﬁlled without changing the occupation of the outer 6s
shell, which determines the chemical character of an el-
ement (see below). Also for all actinides from radium
(Z = 88) to Rutherfordium (Z = 104) the occupation
of the outer shell 7s is the same while the inner shells
5 f and 6d are successively ﬁlled up.
6.2.3 Atomic Volumes and Ionization Energies
The shell structure of the atomic electron distribution
is substantiated by many experimental results. We will
only present some of them here.
The experimental techniques discussed in Sect. 2.4
allow the determination of atomic sizes and volumes.
The dependence of these volumes on the number
Z of atomic electrons exhibit a typical periodicity
(Fig. 6.15) corresponding to that of the periodic table.
Each time a new electron shell starts to be occupied
(for the elements Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs), the atomic vol-
umes jump upwards. The atomic shell model explains
this readily, because the new shell with a higher prin-
cipal quantum number n has a larger mean radius ⟨r⟩

where < r >= mean atomic radius with the number Z of
electrons. Atomic volumes from the ratio Vmol = Mmol/S of
molar mass Mmol and density S. (adapted from MIT course
3.091). The black bars indicate the end of a row in the
periodic table
(see Fig. 5.7) than the shells with lower n values. If the
atomic volume
Va = VM/Na = MM/(ρNa)
is determined from the molar mass MM, the densi-
ty ρ and the Avogadro number Na, slight deviations
from the values in Fig. 6.15a are obtained (Fig. 6.15b).
The reason is that the density not only depends on

214
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
the atomic masses but also on the interatomic forces,
which can be attractive or repulsive. One example is the
He-atom, which has a negligible interaction with neigh-
bouring atoms and therefore a smaller density resulting
in a larger molar volume.
Also, the ionization energies Eion show this peri-
odicity (Fig. 6.16). The energy necessary to remove
the outer electron (which is the most weakly bound
electron) from its state (n.l.ml) to inﬁnity is

which depends on the average distance ⟨r⟩= rn of
the electron from the nucleus with the effective
charge eZeff = e(Z −S), partly shielded by the inner
electrons, with the shielding parameter S.
The noble gases, with their closed, fully occupied
shells have the smallest value of ⟨r⟩, which means
the largest effective charge eZeff of all elements in
the same row of the periodic table and therefore the
highest ionization energy. They form the sharp peaks
in the curve in Fig. 6.16 while the alkali atoms, where

the electron in the outer shell, occupied by only one
electron, is more shielded by the lower closed shells,
represent the minima in the ionization curve Eion(Z).
In Table 6.3 all measured ionization energies and the
effective charge numbers Zeff are listed for the ﬁrst
36 elements in the periodic table.
In Fig. 6.17 the successive ﬁlling of the differ-
ent shells with electrons is illustrated. There are some
anomalies in this process. For example: After the 3p

6.2. Building-up Principle of the Electron Shell for Larger Atoms
215
Fig. 6.17. Building up the electron shells of all chemical elements
subshell of the M-shell has been completely ﬁlled, the
next two electrons are not put into the empty 3d sub-
shell but into the 4s subshell of the N-shell. Only after
the 4s shell is ﬁlled with 2 electrons, the next electrons
are ﬁlling the 3d shell. The reason for this anomaly is
the energetic order of the different subshell. Quantum
mechanical calculations clearly show, that the electrons
in the 4s shell have lower energies than two electrons
in the 3d shell. This is due to the fact, that the 3d wave-
function has its maximum at a much larger radius r

216
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
than the 4s wavefunction (see Fig. 5.7 and Table 5.2).
The mean distance of the electrons from the nucleus is
therefore larger in the 3d state than in the 4s state.
A similar situation occurs for the transition from the
full 4p shell to the 5s shell before the 4d shell is ﬁlled.
Before the 4 f shell is ﬁlled the 5p and the 6s-shells are
occupied because their energies are lower than that of
the 4 f shell. The successive ﬁlling of the subshells can
be better memorized with the help of Fig. 6.18.
Since the mean radius rn in the Bohr’s atomic model
is given by (3.84), the ionization energy for an elec-
tron in an unshielded Coulomb potential of the nuclear
charge Ze is

6.2.4 The Periodic System of the Elements
Dijmitrij Iwanowitsch Mendelejew (1834–1907) and
Julius Lothor Meyer (1830–1895) had the idea,
independent from each other, to arrange all chemical
elements with increasing atomic numbers A in a table
with several rows in such a way, that elements with
similar chemical properties are all placed in the same
column of the table (Fig. 6.19). Later on, it turned out
that the number Z of atomic electrons, rather than the
atomic mass number N is the correct ordering parame-
ter. This gives seven rows (periods) and eight columns
(groups of elements), where all elements with simi-
lar chemical properties are included in one of these
groups. The alkali elements form the ﬁrst group, the
alkaline earth elements form the second, the halo-
gens the seventh and the noble gases are in the eighth
column.
In the sixth period, the third row comprises all
rare-earth elements (lanthanides) from La to Lu and in
the seventh period, the third row includes all actinides
and trans-uranium elements from Th to the artiﬁcially
produced heavy element Lawrencium Lr with nuclear
charge Z = 103.
The explanation of this arrangement of all elements
is now completely understood based on the structure of
the atomic electron shells, discussed in the foregoing
section.
The ordering parameter in the periodic system of
the elements is the nuclear charge number Z that
equals the number of atomic electrons.
The atomic mass numbers A are nearly integers for
all elements with a single isotope. Isotopes of the same
chemical element have the same nuclear charge num-
ber Z (i.e., the same number of protons in the nucleus)
but differ in the number N of neutrons. Their atomic
mass numbers
A =
2
Z(mp + me) + N · mn
3
/(MC/12)
therefore differ.
The small difference in A from an integer for el-
ements with only a single isotope is caused by the
mass defect ΔM = ΔENB/c2 due to the nuclear bind-
ing energy. If several isotopes of an elements exists,
the atomic mass number can be far from an integer. It
depends on the relative abundances of these isotopes

Fig. 6.19. The periodic table of the elements. The mean mass
numbers are averaged over all natural isotopes of an element.
The lanthanides (upper blue row) are all in column III of the
sixth row, the actinides (lower blue row) are in column III of
the seventh row
and is the weighted average of the mass numbers of the
different isotopes:
¯A =
.
ηi Ai
with
ηi =
Ni
- Ni
,
(6.26)
where Ni is the number of atoms per mol of the isotope
with mass Mi and N = - Ni is the total number per
mol of atoms of this element.
The chemical properties of the elements are main-
ly determined by the outer electrons with the smallest
binding energy, which are therefore called the valence
electrons. The reason for this is as follows.
In chemical reactions where atoms collide with
each other and form molecules
A + B + M →AB + M
(6.27a)
the atomic electrons are rearranged during such a re-
action. The third collision partner M (which could be
the wall of the container) is necessary to take away the
excess kinetic energy and to allow the binding of AB.
For instance, the electron from the Na atom is trans-
ferred to the Cl atom. The energy that is necessary for
such a rearrangement is provided by the kinetic energy
of the reactants and the binding energy of the reac-
tion product. These energies are, however, small and
amount to only a few eV. Therefore the binding en-
ergy of the electrons can not be larger and inner shell
electrons can not participate in such reactions.
If atoms collide with molecules, the molecule can
be dissociated and new reaction products are produced,
such as
A + BC →AB + C .
(6.27b)

218
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
Such reactions also lead to a rearrangement of atomic
electrons or to a transfer of electrons from one atom to
the other. For such rearrangements the electron cannot
be too tightly bound, otherwise the electron could not
leave “its atom”. Therefore only valence electrons can
participate.
Since the ordering parameter in the periodic table
is the number Z of electrons, and after a shell is ful-
ly occupied a new period starts, elements in the same
column have the same number of electrons in the out-
er shell. The binding energies of electrons in the outer
shell of atoms in the same column in Fig. 6.19 are near-
ly the same, because their effective charge number Zeff
is nearly equal. These elements should therefore show
a similar chemical behavior.
EXAMPLES
1. The alkali atoms Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs and Fr all have
only one valence electron in the outer shell. They
are all monovalent and have a similar chemical
behavior.
2. All noble gases He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and Rn have
a fully occupied outer shell. These are therefore
placed in the last column of the periodic table. In
order to excite an electron, it has to be lifted into
a higher nonoccupied shell. This demands a large
energy (for He, e.g., about 20 eV). Such a large
energy is not available for most chemical reac-
tions. Therefore noble gases are chemically inactive
and do not react with other elements under nor-
mal conditions. If, however, one of the electrons
is excited into a higher shell by other means (for
instance by electron impact in a gas discharge),
then the noble gas atom can react, because now
much less energy is required to transfer the elec-
tron from the excited state to the other reaction
partners.
3. The halogens F, Cl, Br and I all have one empty
place in their nearly ﬁlled outer shell. They all be-
have chemically similar and react with alkali atoms
readily, because the energy gain achieved by bring-
ing the electron from the alkali atom into this hole is
larger than the binding energy of the electron in the
alkali atom. The alkali-halogen molecule forms an
ionic bond Na+Cl−, where the electron has a larg-
er probability of being in the electron shell of the
halogen atom than in the alkali atom.
4. All lanthanides from Lanthanum to Lutetium have
the same number of electrons in the outer P-
subshell. They only differ in the number of elec-
trons in inner, incompletely ﬁlled shells (see
Table 6.2).
Other physical properties of the elements, such as
the electrical conductivity, also depend on the struc-
ture of their electron shell and can be satisfactorily
explained by our atomic model.
6.3 Alkali Atoms
The alkali atoms are the most similar to the hydrogen
atom. They are therefore called “hydrogen-like”. They
have, besides n0 closed shells with principal quantum
numbers n ≤n0 = 1, 2, 3, . . ., a single electron in the
outer shell with n = n0 + 1.
Since the time-averaged electron distribution in the
closed shell is spherically symmetric with quantum
numbers L = 0 and S = 0 for the total orbital angu-
lar momentum and the total electron spin, the outer
electron moves in a spherically symmetric potential,
which, however, differs from the Coulomb-potential
of the hydrogen atom. It consists of the Coulomb po-
tential produced by the nearly point-like nucleus with
charge Ze and the spatially extended spherical distri-
butions of the other electrons with charge −(Z −1)e
in the ﬁlled shells.
The outer electron can be excited into higher states
by absorption of visible light and can emit visible light
afterwards. It is therefore called a “leucht-electron”
from the German verb leuchten, which means “to
shine”.
When rc is the mean radius of the highest closed
electron shell, the potential Φ(r) of the leucht-electron
can be approximated by a Coulomb potential for all
values r > rc. Since the nuclear charge Ze is very
effectively shielded by the Z −1 electrons in closed
shells, the effective charge number is Zeff ≈1.
For r < rc this is no longer true, because here the
outer electron submerges into the closed shells and the
screening of the nuclear charge becomes less effective.
Here the potential depends on the radial distribution in
the electron shell. The effective radial dependence of
the potential Φ(r) changes from a Coulomb potential

6.3. Alkali Atoms

(6.28)
We will illustrate this by the simplest case of the Li
atom, where the outer electron in the 2s state moves in
the potential of the nucleus with charge Q = +3e and
the two screening electrons in the 1s state. If ri is the
distance of the 2s electron from the nucleus and ri j to
the jth electron in the 1s state (Fig. 6.21), the potential
for the 2s electron is given by
φ(ri) = −Ze

(6.28x)
where ψ(r j) is the wave function of the jth electron
and the integration is performed over the coordinates
of the jth electron. In a crude approximation the in-
ﬂuence of the interaction between the two 1s electrons
on their wave function can be neglected and the wave
functions ψ j can be written as hydrogenic 1s wave
functions, listed in Table 5.2. Inserting these wave
functions into (6.28x) yields the potential for the 2s
electron (see Problem 6.2)

.
(6.28y)
For r →0 the potential equals the Coulomb potential
for Z = 3, while for r →∞the potential becomes
a Coulomb potential with Zeff = 1, which means that
the two 1s electrons have the screening factor S =
2. For the potential energy Epot(r) = −e · φeff(r) we
therefore obtain:
−

(6.29)
For the hydrogen atom, levels with the same principal
quantum number n but different quantum numbers l
are degenerate. This n-fold degeneracy is due to the
Coulomb potential and no longer holds for another po-
tential, even if it is spherically symmetric. Therefore
this l-degeneracy is lifted for the alkali atoms, where

220
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
levels with different values of l within the same n shell
do have different energies, even if spin effects are ne-
glected. The splitting between these levels becomes
larger for small principal quantum numbers n, because
the mean radius ⟨r⟩of the electron distribution dif-
fers for different l-values and the screening effect is
therefore different. For l = 0 the penetration depth of
the outer electron into the electron core is more pro-
nounced (in a classical model, the motion of an electron
with l = 0 would be a straight line passing through the
nucleus), the electron experiences the nearly unshield-
ed nuclear charge and its mean energy is lower than
that for l > 0. The classical path for an electron with
l = n −1 would be a circle with a radius ⟨r⟩and the
penetration into the electron core is minimum, the elec-
tron experiences an optimum shielded nuclear charge
and its energy is higher than that for all lower l-values
with a given principal quantum number n (Fig. 6.21).
This implies that the energies follow the sequence
E(n,l = 0) < E(n,l = 1) < E(n,l = 2) . . .
(Fig. 6.22) .
Using different nomenclature we can write
En(s) < En(p) < En(d) . . . .
(6.30)
The zero reference point E = 0 is either chosen as the
ionization limit E(n →∞) = 0, in which case all en-
ergies of bound states become negative (left scale in
Fig. 6.22), or the energy of the ground state is chosen to
be Eg = 0. In this case all energies of excited states be-
come positive and the ionization energy Eion = −EB
becomes equal to the negative binding energy of the
electron in the ground state. In spectroscopic nomen-
clature, generally the second possibility is chosen.
Instead of energies E the term values T = E/hc are
given. This allows one to express the wavenumber ¯ν =
1/λ [cm−1] of a transition between level |i⟩and |k⟩as
the difference of the two term values:
¯νik = Ti −Tk .
For illustration, the level scheme of the sodium atom
and the possible transitions are given in Fig. 6.23.
The left scale gives the energies in electron volts eV
with E(n = ∞) = 0, while the right scale gives the
corresponding term values in cm−1 with Eg = 0. The
conversion factor is
1 eV = 8065.541cm−1 .

(6.32)
where the integer principal quantum number n is re-
placed by an effective quantum number
neff = n −δnl .
The quantity δnl, that depends on n and l is called the
quantum defect, which expresses the changes of the
energy values Enl against that of the hydrogen atom
(δ = 0) by a dimensionless number.
To summarize we can say that the shifts of the alkali
energy levels Enl against those of the hydrogen atom
are caused by the following effects.
•
The deviation of the effective potential from the
Coulomb potential, which causes energy shifts
ΔEnl that depend on n and l, because of the n- and
l-dependent penetration depths of the outer electron
into the core of the other electrons.
•
The outer electron interacts with the other electrons
in the core and polarizes the electron shell. This
leads to a deviation from the spherical charge distri-
bution even for closed shells. The magnitude of this
polarization depends on the angular momentum l of
the outer electron.
•
When the outer electron penetrates into the core, it
can collide with the other electrons. This may result
in an exchange of the outer with an inner electron,
which causes an additional energy shift.
All these effects are included in the quantum de-
fects δnl. In Table 6.4 the measured quantum defects
for different levels of the sodium atom are compiled.
Note:
The numbers in Table 6.4 illustrate that the quantum
defects depend only slightly on the principal quantum
number n. Therefore the energies shifts ΔE between
En = −Ry∗/(n −δnl)2
and the energy levels En = −Ry∗/n2 in the H atom
decrease with increasing values of n.

6.4 Theoretical Models
for Multielectron Atoms
In Section 6.1 we already saw that even for the sim-
plest case of a multielectron atom, namely the two-
electron He atom, an exact theoretical treatment is not
possible. The reason for these difﬁculties are the in-
teractions between the electrons, which because they
have a non-spherical symmetry, prevent a separation
of the Schrödinger equation as in one-electron atoms.
Either numerical methods have to be used or approx-
imate models that might be calculated analytically. If
one starts from a crude, but easier-to-calculate mod-
el and then improves this model in successive steps,
the physical insight into the effect of the improvements
and their physical signiﬁcance is much better than for
a numerical treatment of the accurate atomic model
without approximations. Furthermore this successive
way of improving the atomic model is not restricted to
a speciﬁc atom but can be applied to all multielectron
atoms.
In the following we will discuss some commonly
used approximation models for the description of larger
atoms.
6.4.1 The Model of Independent Electrons
If we consider an arbitrary electron ei from a many-
electron atom, its electrostatic interaction with the
other electrons e j results in a potential energy

222
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
Epot(ri) =
e2
4πε0
.
j̸=i
1
|⃗ri −r j| .
(6.33)
In the model of independent electrons, this interaction
is not explicitly introduced but it is taken into account
implicitly by using an effective potential Φeff(r) that
depends on the nuclear charge Ze and the time aver-
aged spherical charge distribution of all other electrons.
Any arbitrarily chosen electron ei moves in this poten-
tial that is independent of the momentary location of
the other electrons. This model therefore reduces the
problem to a one-electron model, which can be solved
more easily with numerical techniques. Contrary to
the situation in the H atom, the radial dependence of
this potential is different from that of the Coulomb
potential, although both potentials have spherical sym-
metry. When we insert this effective potential into
the Schrödinger equation, we get the wave functions
and the energy eigenvalues for any of these arbitrarily
chosen electrons.
These one-electron wave functions can be separated
into an angular part and a radial part. While the angular
part is the same as that of the hydrogen wave func-
tions (because the potential has spherical symmetry),
its radial part is different (because the potential is not
Coulombic).
The energy states Ei (ni,li, mli , msi ) in the one-
particle model are deﬁned by the four quantum num-
bers ni, li, mli and msi of the i-th electron. The Pauli
principle demands that each of these states can only
be occupied by at most one electron. Starting from the
lowest energy state and ﬁlling all electrons of the atom
successively with increasing energy into the different
states gives the structure and electronic energy of the
atom.
The question now is how to obtain the effective po-
tential. If the one-electron wave functions ψ j of all
electrons e j (i ̸= j) were known, the potential for the
ith electron could be calculated according to
φeff(ri) =
−e
4πε0
⎡
⎣Z
ri
−
.
j̸=i

1
ri j
|ψ j(r j)|2 dτ j
⎤
⎦,
(6.34)
where the ﬁrst term gives the attractive interaction due
to the nuclear charge Ze and the second term the re-
pulsive interaction with the electronic charge, which
is written as the sum over the charge distributions
−e|ψ j|2 of all electrons e j with j ̸= i, shielding the
nuclear charge. Since the integration extends over all
angular coordinates, the mutual distance ri j is aver-
aged and the second term becomes a function that
depends solely on r. The total effective potential is then
spherically symmetric.
We can therefore reduce the problem of ﬁnding
the optimum effective potential to that of ﬁnding the
optimum one-electron wave functions.
The procedure for calculating wave functions as
solutions of the Schrödinger equation is called ab-
initio method, because it starts from the basic equation,
where the approximation is solely due to the approxi-
mate potential inserted into the Schrödinger equation.
6.4.2 The Hartree Method
The optimum wave functions can be obtained by an
iterative procedure, ﬁrst proposed by Douglas Rayner
Hartree (1897–1958). It is illustrated by the ﬂow dia-
gram in Fig. 6.24.
We start with a guessed spherically symmetric po-
tential φ(0)(r), that approximates, in a crude way, the
screening of the nuclear charge by the electrons. A pos-
sible ansatz for such a zeroth-order potential could be,
for the lithium atom,
φ(0)(r) =
−e
4πε0
 Z
r −ae−br

,
(6.35)
which describes the screening of the nuclear charge by
the two 1s electrons and provides the effective potential
for the 2s electron. The two parameters a and b can be
adjusted to optimize the effective potential.
Inserting
this
potential
into
the
one-electron
Schrödinger equation for the ith electron, the one-
electron wave function ϕ(0)
i
and the energy eigenval-
ue Ei can be calculated. This is now done for all
N electrons of the atom.
The different energy states are then ﬁlled with elec-
trons, starting from the lowest state and obeying the
Pauli principle, until each of all N electrons is assigned
to a speciﬁc state.
Now these wave functions are used to calculate, ac-
cording to (6.34), the improved potential for the ith
electron

Fig. 6.24. Flow charge diagram of the Hartree procedure
If they do not agree with each other within given lim-
its, the procedure is continued until a minimum value
is approached for the lowest energy, because it can be
shown that the energies, obtained with the “true” wave
functions, are always lower than those obtained with
approximate functions. After a certain number of it-
erations, depending on the quality of the zeroth order
potential of the wave functions, the effective potential
and the energy values converge and further iterations do
not change them noticeably. The procedure is therefore
called “self-consistent ﬁeld approximation” (SCF).
The important point of the Hartree method is, that
the total wave function ψ(r1,r2, . . . ,rN) is reduced to
a product
ψ(r1, r2, . . ., r N) = ϕ1(r1)ϕ2(r2) . . . ϕN(r N)
(6.37)
of one-electron wave functions [6.4].
Note:
This approximation is much better than the product
(6.3) discussed for the He atom. There the interaction
between the electrons had been completely neglect-
ed. Here it is implicitly introduced in a global way by
choosing the best effective potential for obtaining the
one electron wave functions.
In Section 6.1 we have already noted that the to-
tal wave function must be antisymmetric with respect
to the exchange of two arbitrary electrons. This can be
achieved if linear combinations of product functions,
such as (6.37), are formed that meet this symmetry con-
dition. Such an antisymmetric linear combination can
be written as the determinant
ψ(r1, r2, . . . , r N) = C
*********
ϕ1(r1)ϕ1(r2) . . . ϕ1(r N)
ϕ2(r1)ϕ2(r2) . . . ϕ2(r N)
...
ϕN(r1)ϕN(r2) . . . ϕN(r N)
*********
(6.38)
which automatically fulﬁlls this demand. When two
electrons are exchanged, two columns of the deter-
minant are interchanged, which inverts the sign of
the determinant. This representation of an antisym-
metric multielectron wave function is called a Slater
determinant. It describes the wave function of a level
in an atom with many electrons as an antisymmetric
linear combination of products of one-electron wave
functions. More details can be found in [6.4].

224
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
6.4.3 The Hartree–Fock Method
So far we have neglected the electron spin. In
Sect. 6.1.3 we saw that the total wave function can be
written as the product
ψ = ϕ(r)χ(s)
(6.38a)
of the spatial part and spin function. This is valid if the
interaction energy between the magnetic moments of
spins and orbital momenta (causing the ﬁne structure
splitting) is small compared to the electrostatic energy,
which is generally the case. Instead of (6.38) we then
obtain the determinant
ψ(r, s)
= C
*******
ϕ1(1)χ1(1)ϕ1(2)χ1(2) . . . ϕ1(N)χ1(N)
...
ϕN(1)χN(1)ϕN(2)χN(2) . . . ϕN(N)χN(N)
*******
(6.38b)
which is again antisymmetric with respect to an ex-
change of two arbitrarily chosen electrons. When using
these Hartree–Fock functions for computing the ener-
gy eigenvalues, the necessary computer time is much
longer than for the Hartree functions, but the results are
much more accurate and nowadays such functions are
nearly exclusively used for ab initio calculations.
6.4.4 Conﬁguration Interaction
The best and most often used method for including
the interaction between the electrons (electron corre-
lation) is the conﬁguration interaction (CI) technique.
Combined with the Hartree–Fock method it provides
the most accurate wave functions and energy values for
multielectron atoms.
The wave function of an atomic state is written as
the linear combination
Ψ (r, s) =
.
k
ckψk
(6.38c)
of Slater determinants (6.38b), where each of the
Slater determinants gives the distribution of the atomic
electrons over the different one-electron levels, called
a conﬁguration. If the energy
E = ⟨Ψ |H|Ψ ⟩
of an atomic state is calculated with the func-
tions (6.38c), integrals of the form ⟨ψi|H|ψk⟩also
contribute to the total energy. These integrals describe
the contributions of interactions between the different
conﬁgurations ψi, represented by the one-electron
functions (6.38b) to the energy.
In the sum (6.38c) only functions ψk with the same
symmetry and the same spin are included. Otherwise
the integrals ⟨ψi|H|ψk⟩vanish.
6.5 Electron Conﬁgurations and
Couplings of Angular Momenta
Besides electrostatic interactions, the magnetic inter-
actions between the magnetic moments of electrons
must also be taken into account. These much smaller
interactions cause a splitting of the energy states in-
to ﬁne structure components. While for one-electron
atoms there are only two ﬁne structure components for
all levels with l ≥1, corresponding to the two different
orientations of the electron spin s with respect to the or-
bital angular momentum l (see Sect. 5.6.3), there might
be more than two components in multielectron atoms.
The manifold of ﬁne structure components of a given
state (n,l) is called a multiplet.
The different electrons characterized by their one-
electron wave function, are labeled according to their
principal quantum number n and the quantum num-
ber l of their orbital angular momentum. The electron
conﬁguration describes these quantum numbers for all
electrons of the atom. For instance, the electron conﬁg-
uration 1s22s2p represents a four-electron atom with
two electrons in the 1s state with n = 1 and l = 0,
one in the 2s state with n = 2 and l = 0 and one in
the 2p state with n = 2 and l = 1. The conﬁguration
2s22p3 of a seven-electron atom has two electrons in
the ﬁlled 1s state (which are not included in the label-
ing, because it is self-evident that the 1s shell has to be
occupied in the ground state of atoms with more than
one electron), two electrons in the 2s state and three
electrons in the 2p state. The total quantum numbers
of the atomic state depend on the quantum numbers of
the individual electrons and on the couplings of their
angular momenta.
6.5.1 Coupling Schemes
for Electronic Angular Momenta
The way the orbital angular momenta li and the spins si
of the individual electrons are coupled to form the total
angular momentum J of the atom, depends on the ener-
getic order of the different interactions. We will discuss
two limiting cases.

6.5. Electron Conﬁgurations and Couplings of Angular Momenta
225
a) L-S Coupling
If the interaction energies
Wlil j = ai jli · l j
(6.39a)
between the orbital magnetic moments of electrons ei
and e j and
Wsis j = bi j si s j
(6.39b)
between their spin moments are large compared to the
interaction energy
Wli ¯si = ciili si
(6.39c)
between orbital magnetic moment μli = μBli and spin
moment μs = gsμBsi of the same electron, then the
orbital angular momenta li of the different electrons
couple to a total orbital momentum
L =

with
|L| =

and the individual spins si to a total spin
S =

with
|S| =
$
S(S + 1)¯h
(6.40b)
of the atomic state. The total angular momentum of the
electron shell is then
J = L + S
with
|J| =
$
J(J + 1)¯h .
(6.40c)
This limiting coupling case is named L −S coupling
(Fig. 6.25). The electron conﬁguration with total or-
bital angular momentum L and total spin S results
(depending on the coupling of L + S = J) in different
ﬁne structure components of a multiplet, which only
differ in their quantum number J. The number of possi-
ble ﬁne structure components equals the smaller of the
two numbers (2S + 1) or (2L + 1), because this gives
the number of possible relative orientations between
the two vectors S and L, and therefore the number of
different couplings L + S = J.
The energy of a ﬁne structure component is
EJ = E(n, L, S) + C · L · S ,
(6.41)
where the last term gives the coupling energy of the
interaction between total orbital angular momentum L
and total spin S. The coupling constant C is given in
units of [1 kg−1m−2].

For L-S coupling, the ﬁne structure splitting
ΔEFS = EJ −EJ ′ is small compared to the en-
ergetic separation of levels with different values
of L or S. In the spectrum of an atom, following
L-S coupling, one recognizes a distinct multiplet
structure of narrow ﬁne structure components
(Fig. 6.27).
•
The ﬁne structure constant C is largest for
the lowest atomic levels (small values of n)
with L ̸= 0 and S ̸= 0. The magnitude of the
multiplet splitting decreases with increasing
principal quantum number n (Fig. 6.28).
•
L-S coupling is valid mainly for light atoms
with small Z values. Quantum mechanical
calculations show that the ﬁne structure con-
stant C is proportional to
C ∝Z4/n3 ,
(6.43y)
while the energy separation between levels
with different values of L only increases with
Z2/n3.
•
For large Z values, the ﬁne structure splittings
become comparable with the separation of
levels with different L values and the validity
of the L-S coupling scheme breaks down.

where each component is weighted by its statistical
weight factor 2J + 1 (according to the number of
possible spatial orientations of J) coincides with the
energy E(n, L, S) of the unsplit level ((2.45) without
the coupling term). This weighted average is indicated
in Fig. 6.26a by a dotted line.
The small ﬁne structure splitting is, for instance,
visible in the spectrum of the smaller alkali atoms
(Fig. 6.28), where transitions from the ground state
n 2S, which has no ﬁne structure splitting, to higher lev-
els (n + x) 2P are observed. The splittings of the lines
therefore directly give the splittings of the upper lev-
els. The ﬁgure illustrates that the splitting increases
with Z although the principle quantum number n of
the ground states also increase (n = 3 for Na, n = 4
for K, n = 5 for Rb and n = 6 for Cs). Table 6.5 shows
the fs-splittings of elements in different Z but equal
n-values.
In Fig. 6.29 the different interaction terms in the
case of L-S coupling are schematically illustrated for
the example of two interacting electrons with l1 = 1
and l2 = 2. The Pauli principle demands for singlet
terms (S = 0) another spatial distribution of the two
electrons (symmetric spatial wave function) than for
triplet terms (S = 1) with an antisymmetric spatial

wave function. In the latter case the two electrons are
farther apart than in the ﬁrst case and the electrostatic
repulsion energy is smaller. The triplet states therefore
have a lower energy than the singlet states. It should
be stressed again that the splitting between singlet and
triplet levels with equal L values is not due to a magnet-
ic interaction, but due to the electrostatic interactions
between the electrons, which is different for singlet and
triplet levels.
Since the potential for electrons in multielectron
atoms is no longer a Coulomb potential, the L de-
generacy discussed for the H atom is lifted and levels
with different L values have different energies. The
vector sum L = l1 + l2 of the two orbital angular

momenta li results in possible quantum numbers L =
1, 2, 3. The singlet term with S = 0 splits into the lev-
els 1P(L = 1), the 1D level (L = 2) and the 1F levels
with L = 3 and the triplet states in the corresponding
triplet components.
The singlet levels show no ﬁne structure (because
the total spin is zero), while the triplet states split into
three ﬁne structure components. The splitting is largest
for the largest L value (see (6.41)).
The different ﬁne structure components are labeled
by the quantum number J, which is given in Fig. 6.29,
together with the degeneracy 2J + 1.

If the interaction energy

between the magnetic moment of an electron due to
its orbital angular momentum and its spin moment
becomes larger than the magnetic interactions

between different electrons, the order of couplings
changes. Now li and si initially couple to form the

This limiting coupling case, which is mainly observed
for heavy atoms with large Z values, is called j- j

Note:
In the limiting case of j- j coupling the total orbital an-
gular momentum L and the total spin S are no longer
deﬁned, although the individual vectors li and si are
known. There are no longer S, P, D. . . levels and also no
distinction between singlet, doublet or triplet levels can
be made. The only well-deﬁned “good” quantum num-
ber is J for the total angular momentum J with |J| =
(J(J + 1))1/2 ¯h. Levels with equal quantum numbers li
for the individual electrons but different spins si no
longer form narrowly spaced ﬁne structure components
of multiplets but are energetically mixed with levels of
different li.
The spectra of such atoms with large Z numbers are
therefore confusing and not easy to assign. The spec-
trum is very crowded as can be seen in the example for
the iron spectrum, from which a small section is shown
in Fig. 6.31.
EXAMPLE
The tin atom Sn (Z = 50), has the ground state con-
ﬁguration 5s25p2. When one of the two p electrons
is excited into the 6s level, the electron conﬁgura-
tion (5s2, 5p, 6s) is obtained with L = 1, S = 1, and
J = 0, 1, 2.
If the 6s electron is completely removed, the Sn+
ion with the conﬁguration (5s2, 5p) results in the
5p2P state, which shows a ﬁne structure splitting
of the same magnitude as the (5s25p, 6s) conﬁgu-
ration of the Sn atom. This demonstrates that the
main part of the ﬁne structure splitting is caused
by the interaction of the p electron with the oth-
er electrons, because the p electron submerges into
the electron shell of the Sn atom. Only the minor
part is due to spin-orbit coupling between the 6s
and the 5p electron. This is a further indication for
j- j-coupling [6.3].

L-S coupling and j- j coupling for

column of the periodic table
For most atoms, intermediate coupling cases apply,
which are between pure L-S coupling and j- j cou-
pling. In Fig. 6.32 the transition from L-S coupling for
the carbon atom (Z = 6), over the intermediate cou-
pling for Germanium (Z = 32) to the j- j coupling for
lead Pb (Z = 82) is illustrated.
The total number of possible levels for a given
electron conﬁguration (li, si) is the same for the two
limiting cases. It is therefore possible to draw for the
transition from L-S coupling to j- j coupling in such
a diagram unambiguously connecting lines for lev-
els with a given J-value. Such a diagram is called
correlation diagram (Fig. 6.33).
6.5.2 Electron Conﬁguration and Atomic States
In this section we will discuss how the different atom-
ic states and their spectroscopic assignment can be
deduced from the electron conﬁgurations.
From
the
building-up
principle,
discussed
in
Sect. 6.2 it follows that in the case of L-S coupling the
total orbital angular momentum L = -li for a ﬁlled
electron shell must be zero, because for each quantum
number l, all levels with projection quantum num-
bers ml (−l ≤ml ≤+l) are occupied. This means that
all possible orientations of the orbital angular momen-
tum are realized and therefore the vector sum L = -li
must be zero.

6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
Since this shell is ﬁlled with pairs of electrons
with antiparallel spins, according to the Pauli princi-
ple, the total spin S = - si must also be zero. This is
illustrated in Fig. 6.34 for the neon atom.
All noble gases in their ground states have the
quantum numbers L = S = J = 0, their ground
state is 1S0.
For all other atoms the values of L and S can be
determined by counting only electrons in unﬁlled
shells. All ﬁlled shells with a given principal
quantum number n do not affect the angular
momenta of the unﬁlled shells.
We will illustrate this for the example of the carbon
atom with six electrons.
The electron conﬁguration in the ground state is
1s22s22p2. The 1S shell and the 2S subshell are ﬁlled.
Their quantum numbers are S = L = J = 0. We on-
ly need to consider the two 2p electrons with l = 1
and s = 1/2. Depending on the relative orientation of
the two orbital angular momenta li and their spins si
different atomic states can be realized, which differ in
their quantum numbers L, S and J. This is illustrated
in Fig. 6.35a, where the possible orientations of the two
vectors l1 and l2 of the two p electrons are indicated.

diagram. The blue levels are only possible for n1 ̸= n2
The level diagram of Fig. 6.35b shows the different en-
ergies of the resulting states, that are allowed by the
Pauli principle. If the two electrons have the same prin-
cipal quantum number (n = n′), only the black energy
terms are allowed. For these states the sum L + S is al-
ways an even integer. For electrons with n1 ̸= n2, ﬁve
additional terms can be obtained, which are marked in
blue in Fig. 6.35b. The triplet states are lower than the
singlet states. Within the triplet states the D states are
lower than the P states and for a given value of L the
levels with the smallest J value have the lowest energy.
Table 6.6 lists the possible atomic states, resulting from
different two-electron conﬁgurations.
The possible states resulting from the p2 conﬁgura-
tion are illustrated in another way by the Slater diagram
of Fig. 6.36. Here the left part shows all ML and MS

conﬁguration of equivalent electrons (n1 = n2). The white
circles are not observed because of the Pauli principle
values that can be realized. The white circles indicate
states that are forbidden by the Pauli principle. The
right part of Fig. 6.36 shows how the different states
contribute to all possible ML and MS values on the left
side. This diagram shows that for equivalent 2p elec-
trons with n1 = n2 ﬁfteen combinations of ML and MS
are possible. Five of these combinations result in the
1D state, nine in the 3P state and one in the 1S state.
The combination ML = MS = 0 comes from three dif-
ferent couplings of the individual angular momenta of
the two p electrons, and ML = ±1, MS = 0 from two,
as explained by Table 6.7. Table 6.7 shows in detail the

the possible multiplicities due to the coupling of the
electron spins are compiled.
The total spin S and with it the multiplicity 2S + 1
of an atomic state depends on the number of electrons
in not completely ﬁlled shells (Table 6.8).
6.6 Excited Atomic States
In Sect. 6.1.5 we illustrated for the case of the He
atom that for excited atomic states, the number of
possible ways to couple the different angular momenta
becomes much larger than for the ground state. The
reason for this larger manifold of possible states is
that now the excited electron has a different principal
quantum number and therefore the Pauli principle
imposes fewer restrictions.
In this section we will present the different possibil-
ities of populating excited atomic states.
Such excitations can be experimentally realized by
the absorption of photons, by collisions with electrons,
or with high energy ions.
One speaks of one-electron excitation if in the inde-
pendent electron model (Sect. 6.4.1) only the quantum

numbers of one electron are changed while they remain
the same for all other electrons. One should, however,
keep in mind that because of the electron correlation
the excitation of one electron does affect the energies
of the others, because the electrostatic interaction is
changed and also, to a smaller extent, the magnetic in-
teractions might change. The energy transferred to the
atom by photon absorption or electron impact is, even
for one-electron excitation not completely transferred
to the excited electron but also changes the energy
of the residual electron shell. This is particularly true
for the excitation of an electron from inner shells, be-
cause here the average distance between the electrons
is smaller and the correlation larger.
6.6.1 Single Electron Excitation
The smallest energy is required, when an electron in
the outer valence shell is excited into higher states.
The excitation energy of these valence electrons ranges
from 1–10 eV. Exceptions are the noble gases, where
the outer shell is completely ﬁlled, the binding energy
is larger and the excitation energy of an electron in this
shell is higher. For example, for helium the ﬁrst excited
state lies about 20 eV above the ground state.
The excited state Ek is not stable. It can decay spon-
taneously into lower states Ei by emitting a photon
with energy hν = Ek −Ei. The mean lifetime τk of
the excited state depends on the total probability of
radiative transitions into lower states (see Sect. 7.3).
For some states this transition probability is very small
and the lifetime correspondingly long. Such states are
called metastable states.
EXAMPLES

H(22P1/2) :
τ = 1.5 × 10−9 s
He(21P1) :
τ = 0.5 × 10−9 s
Na(32P1/2) :
τ = 16 × 10−9 s
2. Lifetimes of metastable states:
H(22S1/2) :
τ = 8 s
He(21S0) :
τ = 19.6 ms
He(23S1) :
τ = 7870s
6.6.2 Simultaneous Excitation of Two Electrons
Under special conditions two electrons can be excited
simultaneously. Assume, for instance, that two elec-
trons from the 2s state of Be (Fig. 6.14) are excited
into higher states. The two excited electrons can pop-
ulate the 2p state, or one electron is excited into the
2p state and the other into the 3p state, etc. The total
excitation energy is then
E = E1 + E2 + ΔE ,
(6.46)
where Ei is the excitation energy for the single ex-
citation of electron ei and ΔE is the change in the
interaction energy between the two electrons and with
the core, caused by the excitation of the two electrons.
The doubly excited atomic state can decay either by
emission of two photons, or the energy of one excited
electron can be transferred to the other excited electron,
due to the Coulomb interaction between the two elec-
trons. This causes a further excitation of one electron
into still higher states and a de-excitation of the other.
This process becomes less likely if the two electrons are
excited into states with very different principal quan-
tum numbers, because then the mean distance between
the two electrons becomes larger and their mutual in-
teraction weaker. This increases the lifetime of such
doubly excited states if their energy is still below the
ionization energy.

Fig. 6.37. Illustration of autoionization of a doubly excited
atomic state (ET = energy transfer)
Since the total energy must be conserved, this pro-
cess of energy transfer from one electron to the other
is only possible, if an excited atomic state exists, that
matches the energy E∗of this highly excited electron.
This is very unlikely for the discrete atomic energy lev-
els below the ionization limit, i.e, for E∗< Eion, but
is always possible for the continuous energy spectrum
E∗> Eion. In this case the transfer of the excitation
energy of one of the two excited electrons to the oth-
er allows this electron to leave the atom and the atom
becomes ionized (Fig. 6.37). This process, which is
illustrated in Fig. 6.38, is called autoionization. The
term diagram is shown in Fig. 6.38b for the case of the
doubly excited Li atom. One electron is excited from
the 2s into the 2p level, the other from the 1s into the
3p level. The total energy of the doubly excited state

of singly excited states at about 5.4 eV. If the 2p elec-
tron transfers its energy to the 3p electron, the energy
of the latter becomes higher than Eion and the electron
can leave the atom.
6.6.3 Inner-Shell Excitation and the Auger Process
When an electron from an inner shell is excited into
higher unoccupied states, larger energies are required
than for the excitation of a valence electron, because
electrons in inner shell are much less screened from the
nuclear charge and their binding energy is according-
ly larger. Inner shell excitation therefore needs either
UV or even X-ray photons or collisions between inner
shell electrons and incident electrons having sufﬁcient
energy.
The hole created in the inner shell by the excita-
tion of an electron can be reﬁlled when an electron
from a higher state Ei falls into this hole. The ener-
gy ΔE released by this process is generally emitted as
UV or X-ray photons hν = ΔE (Fig. 6.39). This is the
source for the discrete X-ray emission in X-ray tubes
(see Sect. 7.6.2).
The energy ΔE = Ei −Ek, available during the
transition of an electron E1 from level |i⟩to |k⟩, can
also be transferred directly onto another electron e2
of the same atom, due to the interaction between the
electrons. If the binding energy EB of e2 is small-
er than ΔE, it can leave the atom, which means that

1 in the L shell
falls down into the vacancy in the K shell and transfers its
energy to the electron e−
2 , which leaves the atom
autoionization takes place (Fig. 6.40). This special kind
of autoionization is called the Auger effect.
The kinetic energy of the ejected Auger electron is
Ekin = Ei −Ek −EB .
Measuring this energy allows the determination of the
atomic state out of which it was ionized.
The emission of X-rays and the Auger process are
competing processes. The fraction of all inner shell
excitations that lead to X-ray ﬂuorescence on the tran-
sition Ei →Ek is called the ﬂuorescence yield. It
depends on the level Ek and on the nuclear charge Ze
of the atom. For Z < 30 the Auger process is domi-
nant, for Z > 60 the ﬂuorescence yield reaches 90%, if
the excitation starts from the K shell.
6.6.4 Rydberg States
In Sect. 4.3 it was shown that the mean radius of the
electron in the H atom
⟨r⟩= a0n2
with
a0 = 5 × 10−11 m
is proportional to the square of the principal quantum
number n. An electron with n = 100, therefore, has
a mean radius of its orbit ⟨r⟩= 5 × 10−7 m = 0.5 μm!
When its orbital angular momentum has the maximum
value |l| = (n −1)h the electron orbit approaches a cir-
cular path with radius r = ⟨r⟩, since for large values
of n the quantum mechanical description converges
towards the classical one (see Sect. 5.8).
For l ≪n the classical orbits are elliptical. The in-
ner turning point (perihelion) of the ellipse comes close
to the nucleus and therefore experiences a revolution of
the major axis (Fig. 6.41). The maximum probability of
ﬁnding the electron is around the black dashed circle
in Fig. 6.41, because there are the outer turning points
(aphelions) of the elliptical orbits where the electron
has its smallest velocity.
According to the Rydberg formula (6.32) in
Sect. 6.3,
En = −Ry∗/(n −δ)2 ,
(6.46b)
the binding energy of a Rydberg electron becomes very
small for large n values. It can therefore be readily
ionized by small perturbations, such as collisions with
atoms or electrons or by external electric ﬁelds.
The ﬁeld ionization of Rydberg atoms is used for
a very sensitive detection of these atoms.
The level scheme is shown in Fig. 6.42. For suf-
ﬁciently large values of n, the potential is close to
a Coulomb potential with Z = 1 because the nuclear
charge is nearly completely shielded by the electron
core. The homogeneous external ﬁeld in the x di-
rection has the potential energy Epot = −eE0x. With

EXAMPLE
With the external electric ﬁeld E = 5 × 103 V/m, the
maximum of the total potential energy is Epot(rc) =
−0.858 × 10−21 J = −5.4 meV. All Rydberg levels
with n > 50 are above this energy and are therefore
ionized. In fact, due to the tunnel effect even levels
with n < 50 can be ionized, although their ionization
probability decreases exponentially with decreasing n.

in a Coulomb potential, the virial theorem states that

From energy conservation En = Ekin + Epot ist fol-

With increasing n the velocity of the electron decreases

tions between neighboring Rydberg levels are

For n ≥60 they are in the microwave range, for n ≥

erties of Rydberg states.

100 the kinetic energy is Ekin = 2 × 10−22 J = 0.6 ×
10−3 eV. The velocity of the Rydberg electron on a cir-
cular path with r = n2a0 is then v = 2.2 × 104 m/s,
its revolution period is Tn = 2π/v = 1.4 × 10−10 s and
its revolution frequency ν = 7 × 109 s−1. Compared to
the period T1 = 1.4 × 10−16 s for the lowest orbital
with n = 1 the Rydberg electron moves very slowly.
For heavy atoms with Z ≫1 the difference be-
comes even larger, because the velocity on the inner
orbit where the nuclear charge Ze is barely shielded,
scales with Z.
The frequency ν(n →n + 1) of transitions between
neighboring Rydberg levels n = 100 and n + 1 is ν =
6.5 GHz.
If in atoms with more than one electron, one of
the electrons is excited into such a high lying Rydberg
state, it mainly moves outside the charge distribution
of the other electrons. The potential for the Rydberg
electron is therefore nearly the Coulomb potential of
an ion with the effective charge Qeff = +e, because
the nuclear charge is nearly cancelled by the Z −1

other electrons. The screening of the nuclear Coulomb
potential depends on the penetration depth of the
Rydberg electron into the atomic core, which in turn
depends on the angular momentum of the Rydberg
electron. For the maximum angular momentum quan-
tum number l = n −1 the classical orbit is circular
and the penetration depth is minimum while for small
values of l ≪n, the classical path is an ellipse with
large eccentricity and the Rydberg electron submerges
deep into the core where it experiences the deviation
from the Coulomb potential.
In the quantum mechanical language the deviation
of the potential for a Rydberg electron from the pure
Coulomb potential of a one-electron atom depends on
the spatial overlap of the wave functions of the Rydberg
electron with those of the core electrons. These wave
functions depend on the quantum numbers n and l (see
Fig. 5.7).
The energies of Rydberg levels in multielectron
atoms is therefore shifted against the energy
En = −Ry∗/n2
(6.47)
of hydrogen like atoms. This energy shift can be
expressed by the so-called quantum defect δnl. The
Rydberg formula (6.47) is then generalized to
En,l = −
Ry∗
(n −δn,l)2 = −Ry∗

eff
,
(6.48)
where the quantum defect δnl depends on n and l
(Table 6.4). Often, the effective principal quantum
number neff = n −δnl is introduced, which deviates
from an integer. This allows one to use a similar
Rydberg formula for all atoms [6.5]. From the equation
En,l −En = Ry∗

the quantum defect can be calculated. For n ≫δ the
difference between observed level energies En,l and
those, calculated for a Coulomb potential decreases as
1/n3.
6.6.5 Planetary Atoms
When two valence electrons are excited into different
high lying Rydberg states (n,l) and (n′,l′) (Fig. 6.43)
the total excitation energy is way above the ioniza-
tion limit (Fig. 6.44) and autoionization can occur
(see Sect. 6.6.2). Since the radii of Rydberg orbits
scale with n2 the mean distance between the two ex-
cited electrons is large for n ̸= n′ and their mutual
interaction becomes small for large values of n. This
decreases the probability of autoionization and the life-
time of such doubly excited Rydberg states may be
much longer than those for doubly excited lower states.
This allows the observation and spectroscopic char-
acterization of such unusual atoms called planetary
atoms, because the two electrons circle around the
inner atomic core like planets around the sun [6.6].

6.7. Exotic Atoms
237
Fig. 6.43. Classical model of a planetary atom with two
excited electrons
If the two electrons come close to each other, the
mutual interaction increases and one electron can trans-
fer its excitation energy onto the other electron, which
can then leave the core (autoionization, Fig. 6.44). The
Fig. 6.44. Level scheme, excitation and autoionization of
a planetary atom for the example of the Ba atom
ionic state resulting from the autoionization can be
detected by measuring the kinetic energy of the eject-
ed electron or by photoionization of the excited ion
state into a doubly ionized atom A++, which can be
monitored by mass spectrometry. Measurements of the
decay times and their dependence on the quantum num-
bers (n,l, s) and (n′,l′, s′) gives much information on
the correlation energy between two electrons in de-
ﬁned states, which are nearly unaffected by the core
electrons.
One example is the investigation of planetary bar-
ium atoms (Fig. 6.44). By simultaneous absorption of
two photons hν1 from a pulsed laser L1 one electron
is excited from the ground state 6s2 into the 1D2 state
with the electron conﬁguration 6snd. Further excitation
by absorption of two other photons hν2 from a second
laser L2 brings the other 6s electron from the 6snd
conﬁguration into the 9dn′d conﬁguration which cor-
respond to a doubly excited high-lying Rydberg state
with an energy above the ionization limit. This state
can therefore decay into an excited state of the Ba+ ion,
which can be detected by further ionization into Ba++
by absorption of another photon hν2 from the second
laser. The Ba++ ions are detected with time resolved
techniques. This gives information on the lifetime of
the doubly excited state [6.7].
6.7 Exotic Atoms
Up to now we have assumed that the spatial exten-
sion of the atomic nucleus can be neglected and the
nucleus can be treated as a point-like charge. This as-
sumption is justiﬁed as long as the mean nuclear radius
(rN ≈10−15 m) is very small compared to the mean
distance ⟨r⟩between electron and nucleus, which can
be estimated by the Bohr radius (r1 ≈10−10 m) of the
electrons for the lowest electron state with n = 1.
In Sects. 5.1 and 5.7 we have already discussed
that for 1S states with l = 0 the electron wave func-
tion has its maximum at r = 0 at the position of the
nucleus. The energy of the 1S states should therefore
be affected by the spatial distribution of the nucle-
ar charge, in particular for atoms with a high nuclear
charge Ze. Measurements with high spectral resolution
can indeed detect energy shifts caused by the deviation
of the nucleus from a point charge, which are part of
the hyperﬁne shifts (Sect. 5.6).

238
6. Atoms with More Than One Electron
Much larger shifts are observed in exotic atoms
where one atomic electron is replaced by a heavier
particle with negative charge and mass mx ≫me, such
as a muon μ−, a τ lepton τ −, a π−meson or an
antiproton p−. The Bohr-radii (see (3.85))
rn = 4πε0 ¯h2n2
Ze2μ
(6.49)
of these particles, which scale inversely proportional to
the reduced mass
μ =
mx MN
mx + MN
are much smaller than for the corresponding orbits
of an electron in the Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus
with charge Ze. The inﬂuence of the spatial distri-
bution of the nuclear charge on the energy levels of
such exotic atoms is therefore much more pronounced.
Measurements of these energy shifts give detailed in-
formation on the spatial charge distribution and the
mass distribution within the nucleus and their depen-
dence on the nuclear spin.
Unfortunately the elementary particles μ−, π−
or τ −are not stable. They decay within 10−6 s to 10−8 s
into other particles. Therefore the exotic atoms only
exist for a short time. This makes their spectroscop-
ic characterization difﬁcult. Nevertheless it has been
possible in recent years to produce sufﬁcient numbers
of exotic atoms and to perform accurate spectroscop-
ic measurements of their energy states and transition
probabilities [6.8, 9, 10]. This will be illustrated by
some examples.
6.7.1 Muonic Atoms
A muonic atom consists of the atomic nucleus, a neg-
atively charged muon μ−and the electron shell with
(Z −p) electrons. When the muon is captured by the
neutral atom with Z electrons, the released energy (ki-
netic energy and binding energy of the muon) can
be transferred to the electron shell and p electrons
(p = 1, 2, 3, . . .) can leave the atom due to the Auger
effect (see Sect. 6.6.3). Because of the large muon
mass mμ = 206.76 me the lowest possible Bohr orbit
(n = 1) of the muon is for a nuclear charge Ze with
Z = 30 according to (6.49) only

(b) Bohr-radius of levels with principle quantum number n
for exotic atoms, where the electron is replaced by different
muons or mesons
which is of the same order of magnitude as the nu-
clear radius (Fig. 6.45). This means that the muon
experiences the unshielded nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld and
the energies En of the muonic atom levels are very
much inﬂuenced by the spatial distribution of the nu-
clear charge, while the other electrons have a much
smaller effect on the muon, because their average
distance from the muon is much larger.
Measuring the wavelength of the radiation emitted
when the muon jumps from level Ei into the lower
level Ek allows the determination of the energy dif-
ferences ΔEik = Ei −Ek and therefore the deviations
of the level energies from those in a pure Coulomb
potential. These deviations are caused by the spatial
charge distribution within the nucleus. The potential
experienced by the muon can be expanded into a pow-
er series of r−n, where the different terms represent the
monopole potential, the quadrupole, octopole, etc., po-
tential. A model calculation yields that nuclear charge
distribution which ﬁts best the measured term ener-
gies [6.9]. For muonic lead atoms (Z = 82) the photon
energies are in the MeV range.
Since the mean lifetime of μ−is 2.2 μs muonic
atoms are unstable even in their ground state. For light
atoms (Z < 10) the μ−decays according to the scheme

(6.50)
into an electron, an electron antineutrino and a muon
neutrino. For heavy atoms (Z > 10) the lowest μ−or-
bit is already within the nucleus. In this case the muon
induces the nuclear reaction
μ−+ p →n + νμ ,
(6.51)
where a proton in the nucleus is converted into a neu-
tron. The probability of this reaction is high for the
lowest muon level and the mean lifetime of the muon
is therefore much smaller than for lighter atoms where
the muon orbit is outside the nucleus.
A possible experimental arrangement for the spec-
troscopy of muonic atoms is shown in Fig. 6.46. Fast
protons from a proton synchrotron collide with a target
producing an intense beam of π−mesons, which decay
during their ﬂight within 2.2 × 10−8 s into μ−+ νμ
forming a fast beam of μ−. The fast muons are slowed
down in a graphite block and are completely stopped
in two crossed thin sheets of a speciﬁc material. Here
they are captured by the atoms in the sheets forming
myonic atoms or ions in high lying levels from where
they can cascade down into lower levels. The X-ray ra-
diation, emitted during this cascading is measured with
a germanium semiconductor detector with high energy
resolution.
Meanwhile even the ﬁne structure of energy lev-
els in muonic atoms and Zeeman splittings have
been resolved. The ﬁne structure splittings are here
much larger than in normal atoms and amount to
several eV. Transitions between ﬁne structure com-
ponents can therefore be induced with visible lasers.
These measurements yield very accurate absolute val-
ues of mass and magnetic moment of the μ−muon
[6.11, 12].
6.7.2 Pionic and Kaonic Atoms
Instead of the myon, a negative π−meson can also
be captured by a neutral atom. The energy released by
this capture process is sufﬁcient to eject one or sever-
al electrons from the atomic electron shell (Fig. 6.47).
For a π−meson in atomic orbits with n < 17 the Bohr
radius is already sufﬁciently small to make the interac-
tion of the π−with the electrons of the atom negligibly
small.
The nucleons (protons and neutrons) in the atomic
nucleus interact with the π−meson not only through
Coulomb forces but also through the short range, but
much stronger, nuclear force. A comparison of the en-
ergy levels in the myonic and the pionic atoms gives
information about the nuclear forces and their radial
dependence (because the lepton μ−does not feel the
strong nuclear force contrary to the π−meson).
Exotic atoms with heavier negative mesons (K −,
η−) allows probing of charge and mass distribution at
even smaller distances from the center of the nucleus.
They can give information on deviations of these distri-
butions from a spherical symmetry. Since the lifetime
of the K −mesons is only 12 ns, measurements of the

spectra of these exotic atoms becomes more and more
difﬁcult [6.13].
Instead of leptons or mesons, an electron in the
atomic shell can also be replaced by negatively charged
hadrons such as the antiproton p−or the &−particle
which have a larger mass and therefore even smaller
Bohr radii [6.14].
In Table 6.10 some characteristic properties of dif-
ferent exotic atoms are compiled.
6.7.3 Anti-hydrogen Atoms and Other Anti-atoms
If the proton and electron in the hydrogen atom are both
replaced by their anti-particles, the anti-proton p−and
the anti-electron = positron e+, the exotic bound sys-
tem (p−e+) of the two anti-particles can be formed,
which is called anti-hydrogen. Its production is by no
means trivial but recently the ﬁrst anti-hydrogen atoms
have been observed [6.15]. Their detailed spectroscopy
and the comparison of the energy levels with those
of the H-atom provide a stringent test of possible
differences between the absolute values of positive
and negative charges, of the masses and the magnetic
moments of elementary particles and anti-particles.
In particle accelerators a large number of anti-
protons p−can be produced by high energy colli-
sions of protons p+ with protons. Positrons can be
obtained from radioactive β+-emitters and are subse-
quently accelerated. Both anti-particles are stored and
accumulated in storage rings where they circulate with
high energies. However, only a tiny fraction of these
high energy anti-particles can be slowed down to ther-
mal energies, where they can be captured in special
magnetic traps in order to enhance the formation of
anti-hydrogen. This is a difﬁcult task, since on one hand
a large number of slow antiparticles is needed in order
to produce a sufﬁcient number of anti-hydrogen atoms.
On the other hand collisions between antiprotons p−
and protons p+ from the residual background gas in
the trap or between positrons e+ and electrons e−will
immediately annihilate these particles by the reactions
p+ + p−→2γ ;
e+ + e−→2γ .
After an extremely good vacuum could be achieved
in the trap anti-protons could be captured and stored
for several weeks in specially designed magnetic traps
(Fig. 6.48). This long storage time has allowed the re-
searchers to obtain precise spectroscopic data about
the charge and the magnetic moment of the anti-
proton [6.16]. The result of these measurements was
that the relative mass difference Δm/m = [m(p+) −
m(p−)]/m(p+) and the relative charge difference
|Δq/q| are both smaller than 10−8.
Recently a research collaboration at the European
high energy center CERN also reported that anti-
hydrogen atoms had been observed, which could be
stored in a sophisticated trap design that can store both
particles simultaneously for a short time. In order to
perform precision measurements, a larger number and
longer storage time of both anti-particles is needed.
Experiments for improving the situation are underway
and ﬁrst results are expected in the near future.
Slowing down anti-protons p−in a hydrogen target
at low temperatures, protonium (p+ p−), a bound sys-
tem of a proton and an anti-proton has been observed.

Its reduced mass is
μ = 1/2mp = 469 MeV/c2 .
The radius of the ﬁrst Bohr orbit is 57 × 10−15 m, pho-
ton energies for transitions between different energy
levels are in the range of keV. For instance the photons
of the Balmer α-line emitted on the transition 3p →2s
have the energy hν = 1.7 keV.
The capture of anti-protons p−by heavy atoms
has a higher probability than capturing by light atoms.
Recently, the Lyman spectrum of the exotic atom of
anti-protonic argon was observed. This system consists
of an argon nucleus with 18 protons and 22 neutrons,
but instead of 18 electrons in the atomic shell one
electron is replaced by an anti-proton. The antipro-
ton has a much smaller Bohr radius than the electrons
and the Coulomb-interaction between the electrons and
the anti-proton is therefore small. Transitions between
excited energy levels and the lowest level of the anti-
proton produce the Lyman series with energies of the
emitted photons in the range between 20–200 keV.
These energies can be measured with high accura-
cy using germanium semiconductor detectors [6.15].
They give valuable information about the interaction
of the anti-proton with the protons and neutrons in the
atomic nucleus.
6.7.4 Positronium and Muonium
Positronium is a hydrogen-like system consisting of an
electron e−and a positron e+. Its investigation gives
very interesting information about a pure leptonic sys-
tem of two light particles with equal masses, which
have opposite charges and magnetic moments. Since
the reduced mass μ = 1/2me is only about half of that
in the hydrogen atom the radii of the Bohr orbits are
twice as large. Both particles circulate around the cen-
ter of mass, which is located in the middle between the
two particles. The sum of kinetic and potential energy
is about one-half of that in the hydrogen atom. Accurate
measurements of the spectral lines emitted from excit-
ed states of the system allow one to prove whether the
electron is indeed a point-like charge [6.16].
The positronium can be produced by recombination
of slow positrons and electrons. Fast positrons from
a radioactive 58Co source (β+-emitter) are monochro-
matized by Bragg reﬂection at the (110)-surface of
a tungsten single crystal and are then slowed down
by an electric bias ﬁeld. The slow positrons can be
stored in a magnetic bottle (Fig. 6.49a), where pos-
itive voltages at both ends of the bottle prevent the
positrons from escaping the bottle. By high negative
voltage pulses they can be extracted and impinge as
a positron pulse onto an aluminum foil. Here they
can capture electrons to form positronium. By heat-
ing the foil, the positronium can evaporate from the
foil and pass through a pulsed laser beam, where it
can be optically excited into various levels if the laser
wavelength λ is tuned to the corresponding transition
wavelength λik.
Positronium is one of the few systems where the
lifetime of the ground state is smaller than that of ex-
cited states, because in the 1S state the wave functions
of the two particles overlap and therefore the particles
can come into contact and annihilate by the process
e+ + e−→2γ .

Fig. 6.49(a). Generation of a positronium e+e−. (b) Level
scheme of e+e−
Since the center of mass of the positronium is nearly at
rest, the two γ -quanta with the energy hν = 0.5 MeV
are emitted into opposite directions and are detected by
a germanium detector.
Since the magnetic moments of electron and
positron have the same magnitude but opposite sign,
the magnetic interaction between the two particles
is much larger than the hyperﬁne interaction in the
hydrogen atom, where the small nuclear magnetic mo-
ment only causes a small splitting of the energy levels.
The magnetic interaction can therefore no longer be
treated as a small perturbation and the theoretical treat-
ment of the positronium can not be based on the
Schrödinger equation, but has to use the framework of
quantum electrodynamics.
Meanwhile a series of accurate spectroscopic mea-
surements of positronium have been performed that
allow a precise test of predictions of quantum elec-
trodynamics [6.16]. Here, nuclear size effects, which
are important for precise interpretations of very high
resolution spectroscopy of the hydrogen atom (see
Sect. 5.7) are completely absent and the measurements
give information on a pure leptonic system, where, be-
sides the Coulomb interaction, only magnetic and weak
forces play a role.
Another leptonic system is muonium (μ+e−),
which consists of a positive muon μ+ and a negative
electron e−. The μ+ leptons are produced by irra-
diating beryllium with 500 MeV protons (Fig. 6.50).
They are then slowed down in a target of SiO2-powder,
where they can capture an electron. The neutral system
μ+e−can diffuse out of the target into the interaction
region with a laser beam where it is excited in a similar
way as the positronium [6.17].

•
The theoretical treatment of atoms with more than
one electron has to take into account the interac-
tion between the different electrons. The potential
is no longer spherically symmetric and the atomic
wave function cannot be separated into functions
of only one variable.
•
The total wave function has to be antisymmet-
ric with respect to the exchange of two arbitrary
atomic electrons (Pauli principle). If the total
wavefunction is written as a product of spatial
wavefunction and spin-function symmetric spatial
functions can be only combined with antisymmet-
ric spin functions and vice versa.
•
Another formulation of the Pauli-principle is:
An atomic state (n,l, ml, ms), characterized by
the four quantum numbers n (principal quantum
number), l (orbital angular momentum quantum
number), ml (projection quantum number of
orbital angular momentum) and ms (electron
spin projection quantum number) can only be
occupied by at most one electron.
•
The Pauli principle and the principle of minimum
energy govern the building-up of the electron
shells of all atoms. The shell structure of atomic
electrons resulting from these principles, explains
the arrangement of all chemical elements in the
periodic system of elements.
•
The dependence of atomic volumes and ionization
energies on the number Z of atomic electrons
reﬂect the shell structure of the electron arrange-
ment in atoms. Alkali atoms have the smallest
ionization energy and the largest atomic volume
of all elements in the same row of the periodic
table. Noble gas atoms have the highest ionization
energy and the smallest atomic volume in their
row.
•
Alkali atoms are hydrogen-like. They have only
one electron in the highest occupied shell. The
potential for this electron is spherically symme-
tric but deviates from a Coulomb potential. The
Rydberg term energies can be described by a Ryd-
berg formula in the same way as for the H atom if
the integer principal quantum number n is repla-
ced by a non-integer effective principal quantum
number neff = n −δn,l, where the quantum defect
δn,l depends on the quantum numbers n and l.
•
The spatial charge distribution and the term
energies of multi-electron atoms with Z electrons
can be approximately calculated with the Hartree
method, which is an iterative optimization proce-
dure based on the assumption that each electron
moves in an effective spherical symmetric po-
tential produced by the atomic nucleus and the
average charge distribution of all other electrons.
•
The total wave function ψ(r1,r2,r3, . . . ,rZ) of
these multielectron atoms can be written as the
linear combination of products of one-electron
functions φ(ri) (Slater determinant), which is an-
tisymmetric with respect to an exchange of two ar-
bitrary electrons, thus obeying the Pauli principle.
•
The vector coupling of the angular momenta of
the different electrons depends on the energetic
order of the different interactions. For light atoms
(small Z) the interaction aiklilk between the
orbital angular momenta li, lk of the different
electrons and biksi sk between their spins si, sk
is stronger than the interaction ciili si between li
and si. The different li couple to
L =
.
li .
And the si to
S =
.
si .
The total electronic angular momentum is
L + S = J
(L-S coupling is dominant). The spectra of atoms
obeying L-S coupling show narrow ﬁne structure
multiplets.
•
For closed shells is L = S = J = 0.
•
For heavy atoms (large Z) the j- j coupling is
dominant. The interaction energy ciilisi is larger
than the interaction aiklilk between the
different li, lk. Here the coupling scheme is:
li + si = ji
and
J =
.
ji .
(6.52)
•
The quantum numbers L and S are no longer
“good” quantum numbers, i.e., they are not well-
deﬁned. The different components of a spin-orbit
multiplet do not form a ﬁne structure pattern in the
spectrum, but are so widely separated that com-
ponents from different multiplets may overlap.

an intermediate coupling scheme between L-S
coupling and j- j coupling is observed.
•
In excited states of multielectron atoms each
electron conﬁguration (n,l) and (n′,l′) of two
electrons can give rise to many atomic states with
different energies, due to the different coupling
possibilities of the angular momenta of the two
electrons.
•
Rydberg states of atoms are excited states,
where one electron is brought into a state with
large principal quantum number n. This elec-
tron has a large Bohr radius rn = a0n2 and moves
in a nearly spherical potential formed by the
atomic nucleus and the residual electron core.
The ionization energy of these Rydberg states is
Eion = Ry∗Z2
eff/n2.
•
In planetary atoms, two electrons are excit-
ed into different Rydberg states. They decay
preferentially by auto-ionization.
•
Exotic atoms are formed by replacing one of
the atomic electrons by a heavier negative el-
ementary particle. For the myonic atoms, this
is a μ−myon, for pionic atoms a π−meson.
Such exotic atoms are not stable, because the
elementary particles have a short lifetime. Their
Bohr radii rn ∝1/m are much smaller than those
of ordinary atoms. The spectroscopy of these
exotic atoms probes the charge and mass distri-
bution in the atomic nucleus.
•
Positronium is a system consisting of an elec-
tron e−and a positron e+. Its lifetime ranges
between 1 ns and 1 μs, depending on the energy
state of the system. The ground state has the
smallest lifetime.
•
Antimatter is formed by atoms consisting of
antiprotons and anti-electrons = positrons. The
anti-hydrogen atom has been experimentally
formed by recombination of antiprotons and
positrons in a special trap.

7. Emission and Absorption
of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
We have so far discussed primarily stationary atomic
states that are described by a stationary wave func-
tion Ψn,l,ml,ms or by the corresponding quantum num-
bers n,l, ml, ms, which give all angular momenta l, s
and j = l + s of single electron atoms and the en-
ergies Ei of the states |i⟩, where the index i stands
for all four quantum numbers. The spatial parts of the
wave functions are obtained by solving the stationary
Schrödinger equation and the spin is described by the
corresponding spin function.
For atoms with more than one electron the cou-
plings of the different angular momenta depends on the
coupling strength between them and only those states
are realized that obey the Pauli principle, which de-
mands that the total wave function (including the spin
part) has to be antisymmetric with regard to the ex-
change of two electrons. The wave functions that fulﬁll
this demand can be written as linear combination of
Slater determinants (see Sect. 6.4).
When discussing Bohr’s atomic model we men-
tioned that atoms can undergo transitions between
different states with energies Ei and Ek, when a photon
with energy
¯hω = Ei −Ek
(7.1)
is emitted or absorbed.
Experiments show, however, that the absorption or
emission spectrum of an atom does not contain all pos-
sible frequencies ω according to (7.1). There must be
certain “selection rules” that select from all possible
combinations Ei and Ek only those between which
a radiative transition can take place. Furthermore, the
intensity of the spectral lines can vary by many or-
ders of magnitude, which means that the probability of
a transition generally depends strongly on the speciﬁc
combination of the two atomic states in (7.1).
Besides the energy conservation expressed by (7.1)
also the total angular momentum of the system (atom +
photon) has to be conserved. The transition probability
therefore depends on the polarization of the emitted or
absorbed electromagnetic radiation.
In this chapter we will discuss how such transition
probabilities can be calculated from the wave functions
of the states involved in the transition (Sect. 7.1). Also,
experimental methods for measuring such transition
probabilities are presented.
The selection rules are then discussed in Sect. 7.2
and the problem of measuring and calculating lifetimes
of emitting atomic states is covered in Sect. 7.3.
For transitions of an electron in an outer shell of the
atom the energy difference in (7.1) amounts to a few
electron volts. The transition frequency then falls in-
to the spectral region between the near infrared to the
near ultraviolet (1 eV corresponds to a wavelength λ of
1.234 μm = near infrared, while 3 eV corresponds to
λ = 411 nm = blue spectral region). Since these tran-
sitions mostly give rise to emission of visible light,
the electron in the outer atomic shell is often referred
to the German word “Leucht-Elektron”, which means
“light-emitting electron.”
If an electron in an inner atomic shell is excited in-
to higher unoccupied states, its excitation energy can
be several keV. When it returns to its initial state, ra-
diation with short wavelengths (X-rays) are emitted.
The emission or absorption spectrum corresponding
to transitions of inner shell electrons therefore fall
between the far ultraviolet and X-ray region with wave-
lengths between 0.01–50 nm (a wavelength of 0.01 nm
corresponds to an energy of about 120 keV). The gen-
eration, absorption and detection of X-rays is discussed
in Sect. 7.4.
When measuring the frequency dependence of the
emitted or absorbed radiation intensity I(ω), it turns

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
out that discrete spectra are found where the intensity
peaks around certain frequencies ωik, which obeys the
energy relation (7.1), but also continuous spectra where
the intensity I(ω) is a smooth function of ω. However,
even for discrete spectra, the intensity I(ω) of a spectral
line is not a delta function, but has an intensity proﬁle
with a halfwidth Δω, which depends on the lifetime of
the states involved, on the temperature of the atomic
sample and on its pressure. This subject of line proﬁles
and line broadening will be treated in Sect. 7.5.
7.1 Transition Probabilities
In this section we will discuss what a transition proba-
bility means and how it depends on the wave functions
of the atomic states involved in a speciﬁc transition
between these states. Some techniques for measuring
transition probabilities are presented.
7.1.1 Induced and Spontaneous Transitions,
Einstein Coefﬁcients
If an atom in the state |k⟩with energy Ek is brought into
an electromagnetic radiation ﬁeld with spectral energy
density wν(ν) (this is the ﬁeld energy per unit volume
and unit frequency interval Δν = 1 s−1) it can absorb
a photon hν, which brings the atom into a state with
higher energy Ei = Ek + hν.
The probability per second for such an absorbing
transition
dPabs
ki
dt
= Bkiwν(ν)
(7.2)
is proportional to the spectral energy density wν(ν) =
n(ν)hν of the radiation ﬁeld (where n(ν) is the number
of photons hν per unit volume within the frequency in-
terval Δν = 1 s−1). The proportionality factor Bki is
the Einstein coefﬁcient for absorption. Each absorp-
tion takes one photon from a speciﬁc mode of the
radiation ﬁeld (see Sect. 3.1) and therefore decreases
the number of photons in this mode by one.
The radiation ﬁeld can also induce atoms in an ex-
cited state with energy Ei to emit a photon with energy
hν = Ei −Ek into a speciﬁc mode of the radiation ﬁeld
and to go into the lower state Ek. This process is called
induced (or stimulated) emission. It increases by one
the number of photons in this mode from which the in-
ducing photon came. Since the two photons are in the
same mode, they have identical propagation directions.
The energy of the atom is reduced by ΔE and that of
the mode of the radiation ﬁeld is increased by the same
amount ΔE = hν.
The probability per second for the induced emission
is analogous to (7.2) given by
dPind. em
ik
dt
= Bikwν(ν) .
(7.3)
The factor Bik is the Einstein coefﬁcient for induced
emission.
An excited atom can also give away its excitation
energy spontaneously without an external radiation
ﬁeld. This process is called spontaneous emission.
Different from the induced emission, the spontaneous
photon can be emitted into an arbitrary direction,
i.e., into any one of the modes of the radiation ﬁeld.
The probability per second for such a spontaneous
emission is
dPsp. em.
ik
dt
= Aik .
(7.4)
The factor Aik is the Einstein coefﬁcient for spon-
taneous emission. It is solely dependent on the wave
functions of the states |i⟩and |k⟩but independent of
the radiation ﬁeld. In Fig. 7.1 all three processes are
depicted schematically.
We will now look for relations between the three
Einstein coefﬁcients.
Consider Ni atoms in state Ei and Nk atoms in
state Ek within the unit volume inside a radiation ﬁeld
with spectral energy density w(ν). Under stationary
conditions the number densities Ni and Nk do not vary
with time, i.e., they are constant. This means that the
absorption rate must be equal to the total emission rate:
Bkiwν(ν)Nk = (Bikwν(ν) + Aik) Ni .

(7.6)
where g = 2J + 1 is the statistical weight (i.e., the
number of possible realizations) of a state with ener-
gy E and total angular momentum quantum number J.
This state has 2J + 1 possible orientations of the an-
gular momentum vector J, which all have (without
an external magnetic ﬁeld) the same energy; they are
energetically degenerate.
Inserting (7.6) into (7.5) and solving for w(ν) yields
wν(ν) =
Aik/Bik
(gk/gi)(Bki/Bik) ehν/kT −1 .

ﬁeld is, on the other side, given by Planck’s formula
(see Sect. 3.1)
wν = 8πhν3
c3

ehν/kT −1 .
(7.8)
Since the two equations (7.7) and (7.8) describe the
same radiation ﬁeld for all frequencies ν and at ar-
bitrary temperatures T , we get for the nominator
in (7.7):
Aik/Bik = 8πhν3
c3
(7.9a)
and for the constant factor in the denominator
gk Bki/(gi Bik) = 1 .
(7.9b)
This yields the relations between the Einstein coefﬁ-
cients:
Bik = gk
gi
Bki
(7.10a)
Aik = 8πhν3
c3
Bik .
(7.10b)
These important relations give us a deeper in-
sight into the three processes of induced emission and
absorption and spontaneous emission:
If both states have equal statistical weights (gi =
gk) the Einstein coefﬁcients for induced absorp-
tion and emission are equal.
Since 8πν2/c3 gives the number of modes within
the unit frequency interval Δν = 1 s−1 (see Sect. 3.1)
the ratio Aik/(8πν2/c3) gives the probability per sec-
ond that a spontaneous photon is emitted by an atom
into one mode of the radiation ﬁeld. On the other hand,
the product Bikhν gives the probability per second that
induced emission is induced by one photon, i.e., that
an induced photon is emitted into a mode of the radi-
ation ﬁeld, which had contained one inducing photon.
Rearranging (7.10b) into
Aik
8πν2/c3 = Bikhν
(7.10c)
shows that the spontaneous emission probability into
one mode equals the induced emission probability if
this mode contains just one photon (after the induced
emission it contains two photons). In other words:
Spontaneous and induced emission rates are
equal in a radiation ﬁeld that contains, on aver-
age, one photon per mode.
If the radiation ﬁeld contains, on average, n pho-
tons per mode then the ratio of induced to spontaneous
emission rates is

Aikc3/(8πν2) = n .
(7.10d)
The ratio of induced to spontaneous emission
rates into one mode of the radiation ﬁeld equals
the number of photons in this mode.
Figure 7.2 illustrates the average number of pho-
tons per mode of a thermal radiation ﬁeld as a function
of frequency ν for different temperatures T . It demon-
strates that in thermal radiation ﬁelds at temperatures
T < 103 K the average photon number n in the visible
spectral range is small compared to one. In this case
the spontaneous emission in the visible range exceeds
by far the induced emission.
In order to enhance the induced emission beyond
the spontaneous emission, non-thermal radiation ﬁelds
have to be realized, where the photon number n is not
equally distributed among all modes but is concentrated
into one or a few modes. In these modes, n  1 and
then the induced emission rate becomes much larger

EXAMPLES
1. At a distance of 10 cm away from the ﬁlament of
a 100 W light bulb, the average photon number per
mode at λ = 500 nm is about 10−8. For atoms in
this radiation ﬁeld the spontaneous emission rate
exceeds by far the induced rate.
2. In the brightest spot of a high-pressure mercury
lamp in the maximum of the intense mercury emis-
sion line at λ = 253.7 nm the photon number per
mode is about 10−2. Even here the induced emis-
sion plays a minor role compared with the sponta-
neous emission.
3. Within the optical resonator of a helium-neon laser
(output power 1 mW through the output mirror with
transmittance of 1%), which oscillates in a single
mode, the photon number in this mode is about 107!
Here, the spontaneous emission into this mode is
completely negligible. Note, however, that the total
spontaneous emission within the Doppler-width of
the neon transition at λ = 632.18 nm, which is dis-
tributed over 3 × 108 modes of the active volume of
1 cm3 and is emitted into all directions, exceeds 1 W
and is therefore stronger than the induced emission.
Note:
When using the angular frequency ω = 2πν instead
of ν, the unit frequency interval dω = 2π dν is larg-
er by a factor of 2π. Since w(ν) dν must be equal to
w(ω) dω, the spectral energy density
wω(ω) = ¯hω3
π2c3

e¯hω/kT −1 = wν(ν)/2π
of the radiation ﬁeld is then smaller by this factor. The
ratio of the Einstein coefﬁcients

is then also smaller by the factor 2π. However, the ratio
Aik/

of spontaneous to induced emission rates remains the

7.1.2 Transition Probabilities, Einstein
Coefﬁcients and Matrix Elements
The relation between transition probabilities and the
quantum mechanical description by matrix elements
can be illustrated in a simple way by a comparison with
classical oscillators emitting electromagnetic radiation.
A classical oscillating electric dipole (Hertzian
dipole) with electric dipole moment
p = qr = p0 sin ωt
emits the average power, integrated over all direc-
tions ϑ against the dipole axis (Fig. 7.3a) [5.2]
P = 2

p2ω4
4πε0c3
with
p2 = 1
2 p2
0 .
(7.11)
The emitted radiation power is therefore propor-
tional to the average of the squared dipole moment. The
quantum mechanical pendant can be rigorously derived
by time-dependent perturbation theory, which is, how-
ever, beyond the scope of this book. We will therefore
use a more intuitive way.
During the absorption or emission of a photon the
atom undergoes a transition between two levels |i⟩and
|k⟩, i.e it changes its eigenstate in time. Therefore
it cannot be described by the stationary Schrödinger
equation (4.6), but we have to use the time-dependent
Schrödinger equation (4.8).

Ψ (r, t) = ψ(r) · e−i(Ek/¯h) · t = ψ(r) · e−iωk · t
(7.12a)
for the state |k⟩with energy Ek, every linear combina-
tion
# = &ckψk›e−i(Ek/¯h) · t
(7.12b)
is also a solution of eq. (4.8). If we replace the classi-
cal average dipole moment by the quantum mechanical
expression
−e·∫Ψ ∗·r · Ψ dτ = −e&&c∗
i ck ·e−iωk·t∫ψ∗
i rψkdτ
(7.13)
only those terms in (7.13b) with i ̸= k do not vanish.
The reason for this is that |ψi|2 is an even function
but r an odd function of the coordinates x,y,z. Since
the integral extends over the whole coordinate space it
vanishes for an odd integrand.
In the classical model a periodically oscillating
dipole moment emits radiation.
In analogy to the classical expression for the aver-
age dipole moment we deﬁne the integral
Mik = −e ∫ψ∗
i rψkdτ
(7.14)
as transition dipole moment for a transition between
the atomic states |i⟩and |k⟩where the two indices i =
(ni,li, mli, msi) and k = (nk,lk, mlk, msk) are abbre-
viations for the four quantum numbers of each state.
The vector r is the radius vector of the electron from
the origin at the atomic nucleus (Fig. 7.3b).
The integration extends over the three spatial
coordinates of the electron. The volume element
is dτ = dx dy dz in Cartesian coordinates or dτ =
r2 dr sin ϑ dϑ dϕ in spherical coordinates.
If the statistical weights gi and gk of levels |i⟩and
|k⟩are equal it follows that Mik = Mki.
We can deﬁne the average squared transition dipole
moment by
⟨|Mik|2⟩= 1
2(|Mik| + |Mki|)2 = 2|Mik|2.
Replacing the average classical dipole moment ⟨p2⟩
in (7.11) by ⟨|Mik|2⟩we obtain the average radiation
power, emitted by an atom in level ⟨i| on the transition
⟨i| →⟨k| as
⟨Pik⟩= 4

4πε0c3 |Mik|2 ,
(7.15)
which is equivalent to the classical expression (7.11)
for the radiation power of the Hertzian dipole, if the
average p2 is replaced by 2|Mik|2.
Ni atoms in level ⟨i| emit the average radiation
power ⟨P⟩= Ni ⟨Pik⟩on the transition ⟨i| →⟨k| with
frequency ωik.
Using the Einstein coefﬁcient Aik for spontaneous
emission, which gives the probability per second that
one atom emits a photon on the transition ⟨i| →⟨k| the
average power emitted by Ni atoms (Fig. 7.4) is
⟨P⟩= Ni Aikhνik = Ni Aik ¯hωik .

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
from (7.17) and therefore the total radiation power
emitted by Ni atoms in level ⟨i| on the transition ⟨i| →
⟨k| can also be calculated.
The expectation values Mik for all possible tran-
sitions between arbitrary levels i, k = 1, 2, . . . , n can
be arranged in an n × n matrix. The Mik are there-
fore called Matrix elements. If some of the matrix
elements are zero, the corresponding transition does
not occur. One says that this transition is “not allowed”
but “forbidden.” The absolute square |Mik|2 of the ma-
trix element is directly proportional to the probability
of the transition ⟨i| →⟨k|, i.e., of the intensity of the
corresponding line in the atomic spectrum.
Note:
Equation (7.17), called the dipole approximation (see
appendix) is only valid, when the wavelength λ of the
radiation is large compared to the dimensions of the
dipole. This is completely analogous to the classical
case of the Hertzian dipole.
For visible light this is readily fulﬁlled since λ ≈
500 nm is very large compared to the average size r ≈
0.5 nm of the emitting atomic dipole. This means that
r/λ ≈10−3. However, the dipole approximation is no
longer valid for X-rays when the wavelength becomes
smaller than 1 nm.
The experimental arrangement for measuring the
emitted radiation power is depicted in Fig. 7.5. The ra-
diation, emitted from the atoms is collected by a lens
and imaged onto the entrance slit of a spectrograph,
which has the transmission T (ω). A detector behind the
spectrograph receives the signal
S(ω) = Ni ⟨Pik⟩ε dΩ T (ω)η(ω) ,
(7.18)
where Ni is the number of emitting atoms in level ⟨i|,
⟨Pik⟩is the average power emitted by a single atom
into the solid angle 4π, d' is the solid angle accept-
ed by the spectrograph, ε is the fractional area of the
image of the light source that passes through the en-
trance slit of the spectrograph, T (ω) is the transmission
of the spectrograph and η is the spectral efﬁciency of
the detector.
Generally, the image of the light source is larger
than the width of the entrance slit, which implies that
ε < 1. Here, an optical ﬁber bundle can be used to in-
crease the total light collection efﬁciency (Fig. 7.5b).

7.1.3 Transition Probabilities
for Absorption and Induced Emission
While the transition probabilities of spontaneous emis-
sion are independent of an external radiation ﬁeld and
solely depend on the wave functions of the atomic
states, the induced processes do depend on the spectral
energy density wω(ω) of the inducing radiation ﬁeld, as
was already discussed in Sect. 7.1.1.
We describe the electromagnetic wave incident on
the atom with its nucleus at r = 0 by
E = E0ei(k·r−ωt) ,
(7.20)
where k is the wave vector of the electromagnetic wave
with the wavenumber k = |k| = 2π/λ. The quantum
mechanical treatment gives the probability per sec

(7.21)
for absorbing a photon hω, which induces the atomic
transition ⟨n| →⟨i|. We have here selected a transi-
tion from a level ⟨n| instead of ⟨k| in order to avoid
confusion with the wavenumber k. For k · r ≪1 (this
means that the wavelength λ is much larger than the
size of the atom) we obtain the dipole approximation

where ε = E0/|E0| is the unit vector in the direction

Equation (7.22) shows that the transition probabili-
ty Pni depends on the scalar product E0 · r, i.e, on the
relative orientation of electric ﬁeld vector E of the light
wave and atomic dipole moment p = er.
When the radiation ﬁeld is isotropic (for example,
the thermal radiation ﬁeld discussed in Sect. 3.1) the
scalar product can be averaged over all directions. This
gives

7.2 Selection Rules
Not every transition possible according to the energy
conservation rule (7.1) is actually observed in atomic
spectra. The reason for this is that besides energy con-
servation, the conservation of angular momentum and
certain symmetry rules must also be obeyed. This is all
included in the transition matrix elements.
7.2.1 Selection Rules for Spontaneous Emission
From (7.16) it follows that for the spontanously emitted
radiation only those transitions ⟨i| →⟨k| are allowed
for which the transition dipole matrix element
Mik = e

ψ∗
i rψk dτ
(7.26)
is not zero. This means that at least one of the compo-
nents

must be different from zero.
We will illustrate this for the hydrogen atom. In
order to make the calculation not too complicated we
will disregard the electron spin and only deal with the
spatial part of the wave function, since in the matrix el-
ements discussed so far we have only used the spatial
part of the wave functions and the integration extends
only over the spatial coordinates.

(7.28)
For linearly polarized light with the electric ﬁeld
vector E = {0, 0, E0} only the z-component of Mik
contributes to the spontaneous emission. We choose
the z-axis as quantization axis. With z = r cos ϑ the
z-component becomes

Only those transitions ⟨i| →⟨k| appear in the spec-
trum, for which all three factors are nonzero.
For circularly polarized light emitted into the
z-direction the x- and y-components of Mik can con-
tribute to the transition probability. The electric ﬁeld
vector for circularly polarized σ +-light can be writ-
ten as E+ = Ex + iEy and for σ −-light is E−= Ex −
iEy. Therefore only the x- and y-components of the
matrix element (7.26) contribute to the transitions.
Forming the linear combinations (Mik)x ± i(Mik)y of
the matrix elements we obtain from (7.27) with x =

7.2.2 Selection Rules for the Magnetic
Quantum Number
The last factor in the matrix elements (7.29) for linear-
ly polarized light is always zero, except for mi = mk.
This gives the selection rule
(Mik)z ̸= 0
only for
Δm = mi −mk = 0 . (7.31)
The last integrals in (7.30a) and (7.30b) for circular
polarized light show that (Mik)x + i(Mik)y ̸= 0 only
for mk = mi −1 and (Mik)x −i(Mik)y ̸= 0 only for
mk = mi + 1 (Fig. 7.7).
In conclusion, we obtain for transitions Ei →Ek
the selection rules for the change Δm = mi −
mk of the magnetic quantum number m
Δm = ±1
for circularly polarized light
(7.32a)
Δm = 0
for linearly polarized light .
(7.32b)
This selection rule also follows from the conser-
vation of angular momentum for the system atom +

7.2. Selection Rules
255
Fig. 7.8. Linearly polarized light with average photon
spin s = 0 zero as the superposition of σ + and σ −light
photon. For σ + light, the photon spin is sz = +1¯h,
pointing in the +z direction. When the photon is emit-
ted into the z-direction the atom has to decrease the
z component of its angular momentum by the same
amount (Fig. 7.7). For σ −light, the photon spin is
sz = −1¯h, giving rise to atomic transitions with Δm =
−1. Since linearly polarized light can be regarded as
superposition of σ + and σ −light, the expectation value
for the photon spin is the quantum mechanical aver-
age of −¯h (for σ −-light) and +¯h (for σ +-light) and
is therefore zero (Fig. 7.8). This implies that the z-
component of the atomic angular momentum does not
change during a π-transition.
We can this also explain by the following argument:
The electric ﬁeld vector E points into a direction
perpendicular to the z-direction, which is our quan-
tization axis. Since Ez = 0 the z-component of the
transition dipole moment vanishes.
For the emission of light Ei →Ek + hν, the angu-
lar momentum mi ¯h in the initial state must be equal to
the sum of angular momentum mk ¯h in the ﬁnal state
and the photon spin (Table 7.1).
When the atom is placed in an external static mag-
netic ﬁeld B = {0, 0, Bz}, which causes the degenerate
magnetic sublevels to split into Zeeman components,
one observes for the light emitted into the ﬁeld di-
rection, two circularly polarized components. In the
direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld direc-
tion, one observes three linearly polarized components,

7.2.3 Parity Selection Rules
Even when the selection rules for the magnetic quan-
tum number are fulﬁlled (which implies that the third
integrals in (7.29) or (7.30) are nonzero, the sec-
ond integrals can still vanish, bringing the transition
probability to zero.
The somewhat lengthy calculation (see [7.1]) shows
that the integrals

ΘlkmkΘlimi sin ϑ cos ϑ dϑ
and

ΘlkmkΘlimi sin2 ϑ dϑ
in (7.29) and (7.21) are nonzero only if lk −li = ±1.

256
7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
Only those transition are allowed for which the
quantum number l of the electronic orbital angu-
lar momentum l obeys the selection rule
Δl = li −lk = ±1 .
(7.33)
Also, this selection rule is a consequence of the
conservation of angular momentum. The absorbed or
emitted photon has the spin s = ±1¯h. Since the total
angular momentum of the system atom plus photon has
to be constant when a photon is absorbed or emitted,
the atom must change its angular momentum during
the transition ⟨i| →⟨k| by ±1¯h.
The selection rule (7.33) can be also derived from
symmetry arguments. We consider the matrix element
Mik =

x

y

z
ψ∗
i (x, y, z)rψk(x, y, z) dx dy dz
in Cartesian coordinates. Since the integration extends
from x, y, z = −∞to +∞the integrand has to be an
even function of the coordinates x, y, z, otherwise the
integral vanishes. Since r = {x, y, z} is an odd func-
tion, the product ψ∗
i ψk must also be an odd function in
order to make the integrand an even function.
The symmetry of a function with regard to a reﬂec-
tion of all coordinates at the origin is called its parity.
The function f (x, y, z) has even (or positive) parity if
f (x, y, z) = + f (−x, −y, −z), it has odd (or negative)
parity, if f (x, y, z) = −f (−x, −y, −z).
The transition moment Mik can be only nonzero,
if the wave functions ψi and ψk of the two states
of the transition ⟨i| →⟨k| have opposite parities.
The hydrogenic wave functions in Table 5.2 have
the parity (−1)l. This implies, that the quantum num-
ber l of the angular momentum has to change by an odd
number for an allowed dipole transition. Since the an-
gular momentum of the photon is ±1¯h, this odd number
has to be ±1 for electric dipole transitions. This again
gives the selection rule (7.33).
7.2.4 Selection Rules for Induced Absorption
and Emission
According to equ. (7.22) the polarization of the
inducing electromagnetic wave, expressed by the
polarization unit vector ˆε = E0/|E0| is important for
the speciﬁc selection rules. The scalar product e · r can
be written as the sum
ε · r = εxx + εy y + εzz
Only those transitions where at least one the three com-
ponents is nonzero can contribute to the transition prob-
ability. Consider for example a linearly polarized light
wave travelling into the z-direction with the electric
ﬁeld vector E = {E0, 0, 0} pointing into the x-direction.
Because ey = ez = 0 the y- and z-components of the
transition dipole moment are zero.
For circular polarized σ + light, travelling into the
z-direction we can write
E = E0(εx + iεy).
this shows that the z component of the transition dipole
moment does not contribute to the absorption. Whether
the other components are nonzero, depends on the
wavefunctions ψi and ψk of the levels |i⟩and |k⟩.
Here the same selection rules are valid as discussed in
Section 7.2.2 and 7.2.3.
7.2.5 Selection Rules for the Spin
Quantum Number
Up to now we have neglected the electron spin. For
atoms with only one electron the absolute value of the
spin is always |s| = √3/4¯h, which does not change
under electric dipole transitions.
The same consideration applies for one-electron
transitions in multi-electron atoms with S = - si,
where only one electron is involved in the transition.
This gives the selection rule
ΔS = Si −Sk =

S∗
i + 1
2

−

S∗
k + 1

(7.34)
where S∗is the total spin quantum number of all other
electrons, not involved in the transition. Since their spin
quantum number S∗does not change, we obtain S∗
i =
S∗
k and therefore ΔS = 0.
For atoms with two electrons where each of the
two could interact with the light wave the wave func-
tions depend on the spatial coordinates (r1, r2) of both
electrons. The transition dipole matrix element now
becomes

7.2. Selection Rules
257
Mik = e

ψ∗
i (r1, r2)(r1 + r2)ψk(r1, r2) dτ1 dτ2 ,
(7.35)
where the integration extends over all six coordinates
of the two electrons. Because the two electrons are in-
distinguishable, Mik should not change under exchange
of the two electrons.
For a singlet state, the spatial part ψ(r1, r2) of the
wave function is symmetric under electron exchange
(see Sect. 6.1), for a triplet state it is antisymmet-
ric. The matrix element (7.35) is only independent
of an electron exchange, if both wave functions ψi
and ψk are either symmetric or both are antisymmet-
ric with regard to an electron exchange. This means,
that both states have to be either singlet or triplet
states.
Transitions between singlet and triplet states are
forbidden. The selection rule is
ΔS = 0 .
(7.36)
Note:
This selection rule is not as strict as the parity selection
rule. It only holds if the spin-orbit coupling is small,
which means that the spin quantum number is well de-
ﬁned. One says in this case that it is a “good quantum
number.” The total wave function can then be separated
into a product of spatial part and spin function.
In heavier atoms the spin-orbit coupling increases
strongly with the nuclear charge Ze (see Sect. 6.4). The
separation into a spatial and a spin part is no longer
possible and S is no longer a good quantum number. In
such cases, one observes transitions between different
multiplet systems with ΔS = ±1, called “intercombi-
nation lines.” Their intensity is still much weaker than
that of the allowed transitions with ΔS = 0. One ex-
ample is the intercombination line of Hg atoms at λ =
253.7 nm, which is emitted on the transition 63P →
61S.
Although the absolute value |S| of the total spin
of the electron shell does not change for an allowed
electric dipole transition, the orientation of the spin S
relative to the electronic orbital angular momentum can
change.

For the quantum number J of the total angular mo-
mentum J = L + S we obtain the general selection
rule
ΔJ = 0, ±1 ,
but
J = 0 ↛J = 0 .
(7.37)
For ΔS = 0 the necessary change ΔL = ±1 can be
compensated by the opposite change ΔMS = ∓1 in
order to obtain ΔJ = 0 (Fig. 7.10).
There is, for instance the allowed transition
2P3/2(l =1, ms =+1/2) →2D3/2(l =2, ms =−1/2) in
alkali atoms.
In Table 7.2 all selection rules are compiled.
7.2.6 Higher Order Multipole Transitions
Besides the electric dipole transitions with transition
probability (7.17) or (7.21) given by the absolute
square of the transition dipole matrix element (7.26)
there are also electric quadrupole transitions and mag-
netic dipole transitions that have transition probabilities
which are smaller by several orders of magnitude. They
become important for cases where the electric dipole
transitions are forbidden [7.2].
Electric quadrupole radiation is emitted by a
quadrupole moment that changes in time. Analogously
to the derivation of the radiation emitted by an os-
cillating electric dipole moment in Sect. 7.1.2, the
amplitude of the quadrupole radiation is proportional

With the spatial extension ac of the electric charge
distribution and the wavelength λ of the emitted ra-
diation the amplitude ratio of quadrupole to dipole
radiation is on the order ac/λ and the intensity ratio
therefore about (ac/λ)2.
EXAMPLE
ac =10−10 m, λ = 500 nm = 5 × 10−7 m ⇒IQ/ID =
4 × 10−8.
This illustrates that in the visible spectral range,
electric quadrupole transitions can be only detected on
transitions for which electric dipole transitions are for-
bidden. Otherwise they would be completely masked
by the much stronger dipole transitions.
The electric quadrupole moment QM of a distribu-
tion of charges qi(x, y, z) can be written in the form of
a matrix (QM is in fact a second rank tensor)

(7.38b)
All components depend on the product of two coordi-
nates or on the square of coordinates. Under reﬂection
of all coordinates at the origin, the components are
therefore not changed. This means that the quadrupole
moment has positive parity, contrary to the electric
dipole moment, which has negative parity. The two
wave functions of the two states of a quadrupole tran-
sition therefore must have the same parity. Since the
parity of the wave function is determined by (−1)l, we
obtain the following result.
The selection rule for the orbital angular momen-
tum quantum number l on quadrupole transitions
is
Δl = 0, ±2 .
(7.39)
The same result holds for the quantum number L
of multielectron atoms.
For the quantum number J of the total angular
momentum J = L + S the selection rules are ΔJ =
0, ±1, ±2, where the transition J = 0 →0 is again
forbidden.
The different selection rules for electric dipole
and electric quadrupole transitions are illustrated in
Fig. 7.11.
EXAMPLES
The transitions
2S1/2 →2D5/2;
2S1/2 →2D3/2 and
23P0 →33P2 are both allowed quadrupole transitions.

7.2.7 Magnetic Dipole Transitions
Magnetic dipole transitions appear when the amount
or the direction of the atomic magnetic dipole mo-
ment changes for a transition. Examples are transitions
with Δm = ±1 between the Zeeman components of an
atomic level, or between the ﬁne structure components
of an atomic state (n,l, ml, ms), e.g., for the transition
3P3/2 →3P1/2 of the Na (3P) state.
The square of the magnetic dipole matrix element is
about 2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of an
electric dipole transition. In addition, the following fact
further drastically diminishes the intensity of magnetic
dipole transitions. Most of these transitions occur be-
tween levels with a small energy separation ΔE. The
frequency ν = ΔE/h is therefore smaller by several
orders of magnitude compared with optical transitions.
Since the spontaneous transition probability scales with
ν3
ik the emitted or absorbed line intensity is indeed very
small compared with lines in the optical range, unless
the latter belong to forbidden transitions.
7.2.8 Two-Photon-Transitions
By “simultaneous” absorption of two photons two-
photon transitions with ΔL = 0, ±2 become possible.
However, they demand high light intensities, which are
only achievable with lasers, because the two photons
both have to be present within the absorption volume of
the atom within the time interval Δt of the transition.

is given by products of one-photon transition proba-
bilities for transitions between the initial level and an
intermediate level ⟨v| at the energy Ei + hν for the
ﬁrst photon ¯hω1 and ⟨v| →⟨f | for the second photon
¯hω2. The energy of the level ⟨v| may not coincide with
a real atomic level, which means that the ﬁrst absorbed
photon excites the atom far off-resonance with a real
level ⟨k|. In order to simplify the diagrams, the level ⟨v|
is often called a “virtual level” (Fig. 7.12). The sums
extend over all real atomic levels ⟨k| that are connect-
ed by allowed one-photon transitions with the initial
level ⟨i|. The two terms in (7.40) take account of the
fact that either the ﬁrst photon with ω1 can be absorbed
on the ﬁrst step i →k or the second photon with ω2.
Since both possibilities are not distinguishable the to-
tal transition amplitude has to be the sum of the two
individual amplitudes (see Sect. 3.5). The denomina-
tor describes the detuning of the photon frequency ωi

ferent photons

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
from the frequency ωik of the one photon transition to
the real level Ek including the Doppler-shift.
Examples for observed two-photon transitions are
the 11S0 →21S0 transition in the H atom with ΔL = 0
or the 32S1/2 →42D3/2,5/2 transition in the Na atom
with ΔL = 2 [7.3, 4].
7.3 Lifetimes of Excited States
If an atom is excited (for instance by absorption of
a photon, or by collisions with electrons) into a state
with energy Ei above that of the ground state, it can
spontaneously relax back into a lower state with en-
ergy E j by emitting a photon hν = Ei −E j. This
spontaneous emission is called ﬂuorescence. This low-
er state E j may be still above the ground state Ek. In
this case it can further relax into the ground state by
photon emission or by a collision-induced transition.
The probability per second for the ﬂuorescence
transition per atom is (see Sect. 7.2) given by the
Einstein coefﬁcient Ai j. If Ni atoms are in the energy
state Ei, the emission rate on the transition ⟨i| →⟨j| is

Fig. 7.14. Experimental decay curve of the population Ni of
an excited level Ei with mean lifetime τi
The population of the excited state Ei decreases ex-
ponentially from its initial value Ni(0) at time zero to
Ni(∞) = 0 (Fig. 7.14).
The constant τi = 1/Ai is the mean lifetime of the
state Ei. This can be seen as follows. The mean lifetime
is deﬁned as

(7.42)
where (1/N0)dNi(t) dt is the probability of a decay of
an atom within the time interval between t and t + dt.
After the mean lifetime ⟨ti⟩= τi the initial popula-
tion Ni(t = 0) has decreased to Ni(0)/e.
Measurements of the mean lifetime of a level
with energy Ei allows the determination of the total
transition probability Ai = - Ain = 1/τi. The specif-
ic transition probabilities Ain can be inferred from
measurements of the relative line intensities of the
individual transitions Ei →En using the relation
Ain = Ai

This yields, with (7.17), the transition matrix ele-
ments Mik [7.5].
If other relaxation processes (for example colli-
sions) add with the probability Ri per second to the
deactivation of level Ei (Fig. 7.15), (7.41b) must be

7.4 Line Proﬁles of Spectral Lines
The absorption or emission of radiation on an atomic
transition
ΔE = Ei −Ek = hνik
does not result in a strictly monochromatic spectral
line, but rather in a frequency distribution around the
central frequency ν0. This gives a line proﬁle I(ν −ν0)
with a full-width at half-maximum δν, which not on-
ly depends on the spectral resolution of the measuring
apparatus but also on basic physical properties, such as
the lifetimes of the atomic states involved in the transi-
tion, the velocity distribution of the moving atoms and
the pressure of the gaseous sample.
The linewidth in frequency units is deﬁned as the
interval δν = ν2 −ν1 between the frequencies ν1 <
ν0 and ν2 > ν0 on both sides of the central frequen-
cy ν0, where the intensity I(ν1) = I(ν2) = 1
2 I(ν0) of
the spectral line proﬁle has dropped to half its maxi-
mum value at the line center (full width half maxi-
mum FWHM). Often the linewidth is given in units
of the circular frequency ω = 2πν ⇒δω = 2πδν or
in units of the wavelength λ. Because λ = c/ν ⇒
δλ = −(c/ν2)δν = −(λ/ν)δν .

(7.52)
The spectral interval inside the full half-width is called
the line kernel, the ranges outside the line wings
(Fig. 7.17).
There are several reasons for the ﬁnite linewidths of
spectral lines:
•
The energy levels of the atoms have an energy un-
certainty δE = h/τ related to their ﬁnite lifetime τ.
The frequency width of a spectral line correspond-
ing to a transition between levels Ei and Ek is
δνik = (δEi + δEk)/h
(natural linewidth, see Sect. 7.4.1).
•
Atoms in a gas move with a mean velocity v, de-
pending on their mass and on the temperature of the
gas. This leads to a Doppler shift of their emitted
or absorbed radiation. The statistical distribution of
the velocities of many atoms in a gas results in
statistically distributed Doppler shifts, which gives
rise to a Gaussian line proﬁle (Doppler broadening,
see Sect. 7.4.2).
•
Every atom in a gas interacts with other neigh-
boring atoms. This results in a shift of the atomic
energy levels. Since the interaction decreases with
increasing distance between the interacting atoms
the level shifts and with it the line-shifts increase
with the density or pressure of the gas, resulting in

We will now discuss these effects in more detail.
7.4.1 Natural Linewidth
An excited atom can deliver its excitation energy in the
form of spontaneous emission. We will describe the
excited electron by the classical model of a damped
harmonic oscillator with mass m, spring constant D
and eigenfrequency ω0 = √D/m (Hertzian dipole).
The time dependent amplitude of its oscillation can be
obtained from the equation of motion
¨x + γ ˙x + ω2
0x = 0 ,
(7.53)
where γ is the damping constant. The real solution
of (7.53) is:
x(t) = x0e−(γ/2)t 2
cos ωt + (γ/2ω) sin ωt
3
.
(7.54a)
Note that the frequency ω =

ω2
0 −(γ/2)2 of the
damped oscillator is slightly lower than ω0 of the
undamped oscillator. However, we will see that for ex-
cited atoms the damping constant γ is in most cases
much smaller than ω0. We can therefore neglect the
second term and approximate ω by ω0. The solution
of (7.53) then becomes
x(t) ≈x0e−(γ/2)t cos ω0t .
(7.54b)
Because of the time dependent amplitude x(t) the fre-
quency of the emitted radiation will no longer be
strictly monochromatic, as would be the case for an
inﬁnitely long undamped oscillation. The Fourier trans-
formation of x(t) yields the frequency distribution of
the amplitudes

where we have assumed that the excitation of the atom
occurs at t = 0, which means that the oscillation starts
at t = 0, giving x(t < 0) = 0 (Fig. 7.18a).

(7.55b)
In the vicinity of the resonance frequency ω0 is |ω −
ω0| ≪ω0. We can therefore neglect the second term
in (7.55b).
The amplitude A(ω) is proportional to the Fourier
component E(ω) of the electric ﬁeld of the emit-
ted radiation. Therefore the spectral radiation power
density Pω(ω) is
Pω(ω) ∝A(ω)A∗(ω) .
In the vicinity of the central eigenfrequency ω0 we
then obtain the spectral proﬁle of the radiation power
density
Pω(ω) =
C
(ω −ω0)2 + (γ/2)2 .
(7.56)
The constant C is chosen in such a way that the total
power becomes

Pω(ω) dω = P0 .
(7.57a)
The substitution ω′ = ω −ω0 transforms the integral
into

0
Pω(ω) dω ≈

−∞
Pω(ω′) dω′ = P0 .
(7.57b)
The integration of this integral yields C = P0γ/2π.
The normalized line proﬁle
Pω(ω) = P0
γ/2π
(ω −ω0)2 + (γ/2)2
(7.58a)
is called the Lorentzian proﬁle (Fig. 7.18b). The
full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) is derived
from (7.58) as
δωn = γ ⇒δνn = γ/2π .
(7.59)
This FWHM is called the natural linewidth, because
it is caused by the spontaneous emission of the atom,
without any external inﬂuences.
Note:
Sometimes one ﬁnds in the literature another normal-
ization where the constant C is chosen in such a way
that P0 = Pω(ω0) becomes the spectral power density
at the line center. This gives C = (γ/2)2P0 and the line
proﬁle becomes
Pω(ω) =

We can gain more physical insight into the energetic
conditions during the emission of radiation, when we
multiply both sides of (7.53) by m ˙x, which gives
m ˙x ¨x + mω2
0x ˙x = −γ m ˙x2 .
(7.60)
This can be written as

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
The expression in the brackets represents the total ener-
gy W = Ekin + Epot as the sum of kinetic and potential
energy. Inserting x(t) from (7.54b) into the left side
of (7.61) gives for γ ≪ω0 the radiation power
P = dW

P = dW
dt = −1
2γ mx2

0e−γ t .
(7.63)
Since the decrease of the oscillator energy equals the
radiation power, we can see from (7.63) that the radia-
tion power decreases exponentially and after the mean
lifetime τ = 1/γ it has only 1/e of its initial power
P(t = 0) = P0.
In Sect. 7.3 we have seen that the mean lifetime
τi = 1/Ai of an excited atomic state is related to the
Einstein coefﬁcient Ai for spontaneous emission. This
means that when we replace the classical damping con-
stant γ by the Einstein coefﬁcient Ai we can directly
adopt the formulas for a classical damped harmonic os-
cillator to describe the time dependence of spontaneous
emission of excited atoms. We then obtain for the natu-
ral linewidth of a transition from level |i⟩to the ground
state
δωn = Ai = 1
τi
⇒δνn = Ai
2π =
1
2πτi
.
(7.64)
These equations can be also derived from Heisenberg’s
uncertainty relations. If an atomic state has a mean life-
time τ, its energy can be determined only within an
uncertainty ΔE = ¯h/τ. The frequency uncertainty of
the emission from this state into the ground state (with
τ0 = ∞) is then
Δν = ΔE/h =
1
2πτ ⇒Δν = δνn .
For a transition between two excited states Ek and Ei
with lifetimes τk and τi both energy uncertainties
contribute to the linewidth (Fig. 7.19), which yields

Fig. 7.19. Natural linewidth caused by the energy uncer-

EXAMPLES
1. The natural linewidth of the Na D-line, emitted on
the transition from the excited level 3P1/2 (τ =
16 ns) into the ground state 3S1/2 (τ = ∞) is
δνn =
109
16 · 2π ≈107s−1 = 10 MHz .
Since the frequency at the line center is ν0 = 5 ×
1014 s−1 the damping constant γ = 6.25 × 107 is
very small compared to ω0 = 2πν0. Only after
8 × 106 oscillation periods the amplitude has de-
creased to 1/e of its initial value. This illustrates
that the approximation γ ≪ω0, made above, is
indeed well justiﬁed.
2. For metastable excited states, the lifetimes may be-
come very long, because there are no allowed spon-
taneous transitions to lower states. Examples are the
22S1/2 states of the H atom, or the 23S1 state of the
He atom. The excited 22S1/2 state of the hydrogen
atom can only undergo a two-photon transition into
the ground state. Its lifetime is about 0.14 s (!) and
its natural linewidth is accordingly δνn = 1.1 s−1.
Such a small linewidth can be measured only with
special techniques (see Chap. 11).

Doppler-shift emitted. (b) Absorbed photons. (c) Gaussian
line proﬁle caused by the thermal velocity distribution of
absorbing or emitting atoms
emitted into the direction of the wave vector k of the
wave appears for an observer at rest Doppler-shifted to
ωe = ω0 + k · v
with
|k| = 2π/λ
(7.66)
(Fig. 7.20a). Also, the absorption frequency ωa of an
atom, moving with the velocity v changes. If a plane
wave with wave vector k and frequency ω hits the mov-
ing atom, the frequency ω appears in the moving frame
of the atom shifted to ω′ = ω −k · v. Since the absorp-
tion frequency of the atom in its rest frame is ω0, the
wave can only be absorbed if ω′ = ω0. The frequency
of the incident wave therefore has to be
ω = ωa = ω0 + k · v
(7.67)
in order to be absorbed (i.e., coincide with the center
frequency ω0 of the atom in its rest frame).
If the wave travels in the z direction its wave vec-
tor is k = {0, 0, vz} ⇒k · v = kzvz and the absorption
frequency becomes
ωa = ω0 + kzvz = ω0(1 + vz/c)
(7.68)
(Fig. 7.20b).
At thermal equilibrium, the velocities of the atom
follow a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The number
density ni(vz) dvz of atoms in the absorbing level |i⟩
with velocity components vz within the interval from vz
to vz + dvz is given by
ni(vz) dvz =
Ni
vw
√π e−(vz/vw)2 dvz ,
(7.69)
where vw = (2kBT/m)1/2 is the most probable velocity
component, kB is the Boltzmann constant and
Ni =
+∞

−∞
ni(vz) dvz
is the total number of all atoms in level Ei per unit
volume.
If vz and dvz in (7.69) are expressed by the fre-
quency ω and the frequency shift dω according to the
relations (7.68) we obtain vz = (c/ω0)(ω −ω0) and
dvz = (c/ω0) dω. Inserting this into (7.69) gives the
number of atoms
ni(ω) dω =
cNi
ω0vw
√π e−[c(ω−ω0)/(ω0vw)]2 dω (7.70)
that absorb or emit radiation within the frequency in-
terval between ω and ω + dω. Since the absorbed or
emitted spectral radiation power density is proportional
to n(ω) dω, the intensity proﬁle of a Doppler-broadened
absorption or emission line becomes
Pω(ω) = Pω(ω0)e−[c(ω−ω0)/(ω0vw)]2 .
(7.71)
This a Gaussian function that is symmetric to the center
frequency ω0 (Fig. 7.20c). The full half-width is
δωD = |ω1 −ω2|
with
P(ω1) = P(ω2) = 1
2 P(ω0) .
Using the relation vw = (2kBT/m)1/2 converts this
into
δωD = 2
√
ln 2ω0vw/c = (ω0/c)
$
8kBT ln 2/m .
(7.72a)
Because (4 ln 2)−1/2 ≈0.6 we can write (7.71) as
P(ω) = P(ω0)e−[(ω−ω0)/0.6δωD]2 .
(7.71b)

266
7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
The Doppler-width δωD increases proportionally
with the frequency ω0, with T 1/2 and decreases
with increasing mass m of the atom as m−1/2.
With the Avogadro number NA, the molar mass
M = NAm and the gas constant R = NAkB we can
transform (7.72a) into the expression
δνD = 2ν0
c
√(2RT/M) ln 2
= 7.16 × 10−7ν0
√T/M s−1
,
(7.72b)
which is more handy for fast calculations, where T is
given in K and M in g/mol.
EXAMPLES
1. The Lyman α-line of the transition 2P →1S in the
hydrogen atom (M = 1 g/mol): λ = 121.6 nm ⇒
ν0 = 2.47 × 1015 s−1. At a temperature of T =
1000 K in a hydrogen discharge the Doppler-width
becomes δνD = 5.6 × 1010 s−1 = 56 GHz, δλD =
2.8 × 10−3 nm.
2. The Na D-line of the transition 3P1/2 →3S1/2
in the sodium atom (M = 23 g/mol) has a wave-
length λ = 589.1 nm and a frequency ν0 = 5.1 ×
1014 s−1. At a temperature T = 500 K the Doppler-
width is δνD = 1.7 × 109 s−1 = 1.7 GHz ⇒δλ =
2 × 10−3 nm.
3. The infrared transition in the CO2
molecule
(M = 44 g/mol) at λ ≈10 μm (ν0 = 3 × 1013 s−1)
has, at room temperature T = 300 K, a Doppler
width δνD = 5.6 × 106 s−1 = 56 MHz ⇒δλ =
1.3 × 10−3 nm.
These examples show that in the visible range the
Doppler width exceeds the natural linewidth by
about two orders of magnitude.
This is also true for vibrational transitions in the
infrared, where the lifetimes of the vibrational
levels are very long and the natural linewidths
accordingly small.
This implies that generally the natural linewidth is
completely masked by the much larger Doppler-width.
Without special experimental tricks (see Sect. 11.5.8)
it is therefore not possible to measure the natural
linewidth directly. It is, however, possible to deter-
mine it from measured spontaneous lifetimes of excited
states (see Sect. 7.3).
Note:
The Gaussian line proﬁle of Doppler broadening
decreases
exponentially
with
increasing
distance
|ω−ω0|
from
the
line
center
ω0,
(see
(7.73)),
while the Lorentzian line proﬁle decreases only as
(ω −ω0)−2 (7.58). Therefore, it is possible to extract
from the extreme line wings, information on the natural
line proﬁle in spite of the much larger Doppler-width
(Fig. 7.21).
More detailed consideration shows that a Doppler-
broadened spectral line cannot be strictly represented
by a pure Gaussian proﬁle as has been assumed in the
foregoing discussion, since not all atoms with a deﬁ-
nite velocity component vz emit or absorb radiation at
the same frequency ω′ = ω0(1 + vz/c). Because of the
ﬁnite lifetime of the atomic energy levels, the frequen-
cy response of atoms with a velocity component vz is
represented by the Lorentzian proﬁle (see Sect. 7.4.1)
L(ω −ω′) =
γ/2π
(ω −ω′)2 + (γ/2)2
(7.73)
with a central frequency ω′ = ω0(1 + vz/c) (Fig. 7.22).

This intensity proﬁle, which represents a convolution
of Lorentzian and Gaussian proﬁles (Fig. 7.22) is called
a Voigt proﬁle. Such proﬁles play an important role for
the spectroscopy of stellar atmospheres, where accu-
rate measurements of line wings allow one to separate
the contributions of Doppler-broadening and natural
linewidths or collisional broadening. From such mea-
surements, the temperatures and the pressures of the
atmospheric layers of stars or planets from which the
radiation is emitted or where radiation from the inner
part of the star is absorbed can be deduced.
7.4.3 Collision Broadening
If an atom A, with energy levels Ei and Ek, approaches
another atom or molecule B, the interaction between A
and B shifts the energies of both levels. This energy
shift depends on the structure of the electron shell of
both partners A and B, on the speciﬁc energy levels and
on the mutual distance R(A,B), which we deﬁne as the
distance between the centers of mass of A and B. The
energy shift generally differs for the different levels.
It may be positive (for repulsive potentials between A
and B) or negative (for attractive potentials). Plotting
the energies Ei(R) and Ek(R) of atom A as a function
of the distance R we obtain potential curves, such as
those schematically drawn in Fig. 7.23. The approach
of two particles to a distance Rc, where the interac-
tion energy becomes noticeable (this means that the
potential curves deviate noticeably from E(R = ∞)),
is called a two-body collision and the system AB(R) is
called a collision pair. If the densities of A and B are not
too high, the probability that three collision partners ap-
proach each other simultaneously within R < Rc (three
body collision) is very small and we can neglect it.
The distance Rc where the interaction becomes no-
ticeable is the collision radius. If the relative velocity
of A and B is v, the duration of the collision (also called
the collision time) can be deﬁned as τcoll = Rc/v.

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
EXAMPLE
At thermal velocities of v = 5 × 102 m/s and a typical
collision radius Rc = 1 nm the collision time becomes
τcoll = 2 × 10−12 s. This illustrates that the collision
times are very short.
Note, that one has to distinguish between the colli-
sion time and the mean time ⟨τ⟩= n−1/3/v between
two collisions, which is proportional to the average
distance d = n−1/3 between two atoms and therefore
depends on the density n of the collision partners. At
sufﬁciently low pressures, ⟨τ⟩is much longer than τcoll.
EXAMPLE
At a pressure of 1 mbar the density is about 3 ×
1022 m−3. With a relative velocity v = 5 × 102 m/s we
obtain ⟨τ⟩≈3 × 10−11 s.
The frequency
νik = |Ei(R) −Ek(R)| /h
of the radiation emitted or absorbed on the transition
Ei →Ek during a collision depends on the distance R
at which the transition takes place (we assume here
that the duration of the radiative transition is short
compared with the collision time, which means that
in Fig. 7.23a, the transition can be drawn as a vertical
line). In a gas mixture, the distances R show random
ﬂuctuations with a distribution around a mean val-
ue Rm, which depends on the pressure and temperature
of the gas. The frequencies of absorbed or emitted radi-
ation show a corresponding distribution around a most
probable value νik(Rm), which may be shifted against
the center frequency ν0 of the unperturbed atom A. The
shift Δν = ν0 −νik(Rm) depends on how differently
the two energy levels Ei and Ek are shifted at a distance
Rm(A,B) where the transition probability for emission
or absorption has a maximum.
The intensity proﬁle I(ω) of the collision broadened
emission line can be described by
I(ω) ∝

Aik(R)Pcoll(R) [Ei(R) −Ek(R)] dR ,
(7.75)
where Aik(R) is the spontaneous transition probabili-
ty, which depends on R because the electronic wave
functions of the collision pair (AB) depend on R. The
probability Pcoll(R) that the distance R lies between R
and R + dR depends on the interaction potential, the
density and the temperature of the gas. It can be derived
in the following way:
The number of particles B in a spherical shell with
radius R around atom A is
NB(R) dR = n04π R2 dRe−Epot(R)/kT ,
(7.76)
where n0 is the average density of atoms B. The
Boltzmann factor exp(−Epot/kT ) takes into account
that the energy of the collision pair depends on the
potential interaction energy Epot(R). The probability
P(R) is (N(R)/n0). Inserting this into (7.75) gives the
intensity proﬁle of the absorption line

ature gives

(7.78)
This allows the determination of the ground state po-
tential seperately!
From the temperature dependence of the line pro-
ﬁle, one can determine the interaction potential
for the two corresponding states separately, while
from measurements at constant temperature only
the difference ΔE(R) can be obtained.
Frequently, spherical model potentials are substitut-
ed into (7.77), such as the Lenard–Jones potential
Epot(R) =
a
R12 −b
R6 .
(7.79)
The coefﬁcients a and b are adjusted for optimum
agreement between theory and experiment.
So far we have only discussed elastic collisions,
where the energy level of the atom A is only shifted
during the collision, but returns to its initial value after
the collision, unless the atom has emitted a photon dur-
ing the collision. The shift of absorption or emission
lines caused by elastic collisions corresponds to an en-
ergy shift ΔE = ¯hΔω between the excitation energy

7.4. Line Proﬁles of Spectral Lines
269
¯hω0 of the free atom A∗and the energy ¯hω of the emit-
ted photon. This energy difference is supplied from the
kinetic energy of the collision partners. In the case of
positive shifts (Δω > 0), the kinetic energy is smaller
after the collision than before.
Besides these elastic collisions, inelastic collisions
may also occur in which the excitation energy of
atom A is either partly or completely transferred into
internal energy of the collision partner B, or into trans-
lational energy of both partners A and B. Such inelastic
collisions are called quenching collisions, because
they decrease the number of excited atoms A in lev-
el Ei and therefore quench the ﬂuorescence intensity.
The total transition probability Ai for the depopulation
of level Ei is the sum of radiative and collision-induced
probabilities

which is identical to (7.50) for the lifetime dependence
on pressure.
It is evident from (7.64) that this pressure-
dependent transition probability causes a correspond-
ing pressure dependent linewidth δω, because it short-
ens the effective lifetime of the excited level. It can be
written as the sum of two damping terms
δω = δωn+ δωcoll = γn+ γcoll = γn+ apB .
(7.81b)
The collision-induced additional line broadening apB
is therefore often called pressure broadening.
In a classical model, which describes the excited
atom A by a damped harmonic oscillator, the inelas-
tic collisions decrease the amplitude of the oscillation.
Fig. 7.24a–c. Elastic collisions as phase perturbers. (a)
Classical path of the collision partner B. (b) Frequency shift
of A during the collision. (c) Resulting phase shift
Although the elastic collisions do not change the am-
plitude, they do change the phase of the oscillation
(Fig. 7.24). Because the energy difference between
the corresponding states of the atom A changes dur-
ing the elastic collision time, the frequency ω of
the emitted or absorbed radiation changes by Δω(R).
This change depends on the interaction potential be-
tween A and B. Although after the collision the fre-
quency again takes its initial value, the phase-change is
(Fig. 7.24)
Δϕ =
∞

0
Δω(t) dt .
(7.82)
Elastic collisions are therefore called phase-changing
collisions. Since the frequency differences Δω dif-
fer for collisions with different distances R(AB), the
ensemble of atoms A has suffered random phase
changes. The Fourier transform of the radiation gives
a Lorentzian line proﬁle, which is broadened and shows
a shift of its line center (Fig. 7.23).
The line proﬁle caused by elastic and inelastic
collisions is obtained after a somewhat lengthy calcu-
lation [7.8] as

are a measure for the line broadening (δvb) and the line

Both elastic and inelastic collisions result in the
broadening of spectral lines. Elastic collisions
cause, in addition, a shift of the line center.
The classical models of pressure broadening and
shifts can be extended to a more general quantum me-
chanical treatment [7.9, 10]. This, however, exceeds the
scope of this textbook.
7.5 X-Rays
In the year 1895, in the German city of Würzburg,
Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (1845–1923) (Fig. 7.25) dis-
covered, while experimenting with gas discharge tubes
Fig. 7.25. Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen (From E. Bragge; Die
Nobelpreisträger, Heinz-Moos-Verlag, München 1964)
developed by Phillip Lenard, that radiation was emitted
from these tubes that could penetrate materials such as
glass, wood or human tissue. Since he did not know
much about the nature of this radiation, he called it
X-ray radiation.
In the following years, the importance of these
X-rays for material inspection and in particular for
medical diagnostics, soon became evident and in
1901 Röntgen was the ﬁrst physicist to receive the
Nobel Prize. In the following 100 years the applica-
tions of X-rays have vastly increased [7.11], ranging
from material sciences, sterilization of food, numer-
ous medical applications culminating in the develop-
ment of X-ray tomographs and discoveries of new
phenomena in the universe using X-ray astronomy
[7.12, 13, 14].
The basic principle of an X-ray tube is shown in
Fig. 7.26. Electrons are emitted from a heated cathode,
accelerated by a voltage U and impinge onto an an-
ode. In the anode material (for example tungsten) the
electrons are stopped and part of their energy eU is
converted into radiation with short wavelengths. These
X-rays leave the tube through a window and can be
collimated by proper apertures.

X-rays are produced by two different effects:
1. By
decelerating
energetic
electrons
(ranging
from keV to MeV) bremsstrahlung is produced
with a continuous spectral intensity distribution
I(λ), which depends on the energy of the electrons.
2. The energetic electrons can excite inner shell elec-
trons on transitions to higher non occupied states
of in the atoms of the anode. The excited states Ei
emit X-rays as spectral lines on transitions Ei →
Ek with wavelengths λik, characteristic for the an-
ode material. These X-rays are therefore called
characteristic X-ray radiation.
We will now discuss both effects in more detail.

Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus of target atoms. (b) Inelastic
collision of an incident electron with an electron in the shell
of a target atom
the Coulomb ﬁeld of the positive nuclear charge
(Fig. 7.27a). Since, according to electrodynamics, ev-
ery accelerated or decelerated charge emits radiation
with a radiation power proportional to the square of
the acceleration, these electrons emit a broad radiation
continuum with an intensity distribution depending on
the initial electron energy (Fig. 7.28). The high energy
limit of this continuum is reached when the total en-
ergy Ekin = eU of the incident electrons is converted
into radiation. This gives the condition
hν ≤hνmax = eU ⇒λ ≥λmin = hc
eU .
(7.84)
Inserting the quantitative values for h, c and e in-
to (7.84) yields the more readily calculable form
λmin = 1234.5(U[V])−1 nm
.

U =10 kV⇒λmin =0.12 nm, or νmax =2.5 × 1018s−1.
U =50 kV ⇒λmin = 0.024 nm, or νmax = 1.25 ×
1019s−1.
Of course, the incident electrons can also collide
with the electrons in the atomic shells of the anode
material (Fig. 7.27b). The outer electrons with a small
binding energy are kicked away by collisions with the
high energy incident electrons, they collide further with
electrons of other atoms and ﬁnally convert their ener-
gy into heat. Collisions with more tightly bound inner
electrons lead to excitations into higher, but still bound,
atomic states. This excitation energy is transferred to
the characteristic X-ray ﬂuorescence emitted by the
excited atoms.
Both contributions represent electromagnetic ra-
diation as was ﬁrst proved by the English physi-
cist
Charles
Glover
Barkla
(1877–1944,
Nobel
Prize 1917), who measured the polarization of the
X-radiation. Further convincing proofs were given by
the German physicist Max von Laue and his assis-
tants W. Friedrich and P. Knipping and later by the
English physicists William Henry Bragg (1862–1942)
(Fig. 7.29) and his son William Lawrence Bragg
(1890–1971) who together received the Nobel Prize in
1915. They measured interference and diffraction pat-
terns when single crystals were illuminated by X-rays,
which demonstrated that X-rays were electromagnetic
waves.
7.5.2 Characteristic X-Ray-Radiation
The spectral lines of the characteristic X-ray radiation
appear only if the energy of the electrons, incident on
the anode, is sufﬁciently high to excite atomic inner
shell electrons into higher unoccupied levels (Fig. 7.30)

Ek(Cu(1s)) = −8978 eV (binding energy of an elec-
tron in the 1s level of the K-shell); Ei(Cu(6p)) =

electrons in the K-shell into the level Ei, which emits
the Cu-K-radiation, if their kinetic energy is above
8974 eV.
The characteristic X-ray radiation appears as sharp
lines superimposed on the continuous spectral back-
ground of the bremsstrahlung (Fig. 7.31). With increas-

teristic to continuous radiation increases (Fig. 7.31b).
However, even at a voltage U = 250 kV it is only
about 0.1 for a tungsten anode.
7.5.3 Scattering and Absorption of X-Rays
When a parallel X-ray beam passes through a sample in
x direction (Fig. 7.32) the transmitted radiation power
P(x) decreases after the pathlength dx by
dP = −μP dx .
(7.87a)
The constant factor μ, which depends on the material
of the sample is the attenuation coefﬁcient. Integration
over a sample thickness x gives
P(x) = P0e−μx .
(7.87b)
The attenuation has two reasons: scattering and absorp-
tion, which may be both simultaneously effective. The
attenuation coefﬁcient can therefore be written as the
sum
μ = μs + α
of scattering coefﬁcient μs and absorption coefﬁ-
cient α.
The scattering is produced by the atomic electrons
of the sample. In a classical model, each electron can
be regarded as a harmonic oscillator induced to forced
oscillations under the inﬂuence of the incident electro-
magnetic wave with frequency ω (Hertzian oscillating
dipole). Assume that the electric ﬁeld vector of the inci-
dent wave points in the y direction. Then the oscillating
dipole is described by y = y0 sin ωt. The amplitude A
of the radiation emitted by the oscillator is proportional
to the acceleration
¨y = −ω2y0 sin ωt = −ω2y .

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
The emitted power, which is proportional to the abso-
lute square of the amplitude, scales therefore with ω4!
In electrodynamics it is shown that the power emitted
by an oscillating dipole is
Ps(ϑ) =
e2y2
0ω4
32π2ε0c3 sin2 ϑ ,
(7.87d)
where ϑ is the angle between the dipole axis (in our
example the y direction) and the direction of observa-
tion. The total scattered power emitted by N scatterers
in a solid sample where all atoms stay at their positions,
depends on the ratio of wavelength λ to the diameter d
of the scattering region. If d ≪λ, the phases of the
waves scattered by the different atoms differ only by an
amount Δϕ ≪2π. All waves interfere coherently and
the total amplitude of the scattered wave is proportional
to N, which implies that the scattered power is propor-
tional to N 2! (coherent scattering). If the diameter d is
comparable or larger than λ, constructive and destruc-
tive interference occurs and for a non-periodical ran-
dom arrangement of the scatterers, the total scattered
power only scales with N (incoherent scattering).
The scattering can be described by a scattering
cross section σs, which deﬁnes the area around a scat-
tering atom through which an incident photon has to
pass in order to be scattered. If the number density of
scatterers is n the scattering coefﬁcient μs is related to
the scattering cross section σs by
μs = nσs,
(7.87e)
with a thickness t of the scattering sample and an
incident power P0 the scattered power is
Ps = P0
"
1 −e−μst#
≈P0 · μs · t for μs · t ≪1 .
(7.87f)
The scattering cross section scales with ω4
or λ−4. It is therefore much larger in the X-ray
region than in the visible range.
EXAMPLE
When
visible
radiation
with
λ = 500 nm
passes
through clear water it is attenuated by scattering to
1/e of its initial intensity only after a path length of
1 km, while the intensity of X-rays with λ = 0.1 nm is
already reduced to 1/e after a 5 mm path length!

Fig. 7.33. The pho-
toeffect
Besides elastic scattering where the wavelength of
the scattered radiation is the same as that of the in-
cident radiation, also inelastic scattering can occur
(Compton effect, see Sect. 3.1.7). Here the scattered
photon with ν′ < ν may be either scattered again or it
may be absorbed. This leads to a complete absorption
of the incident power, if the thickness of the sample is
sufﬁciently large.
The absorption of X-rays strongly depends on the
absorbing material. It is caused by three different
effects.
Photoeffect: The X-ray quantum hν is absorbed by
an atom in the sample in the state Ek. This leads for
hν > |Ek| to photoionization of an inner shell electron
(Fig. 7.33) and can be written as
hν + A(Ek) →A+(Eion) + e−(Ekin) .
(7.88)
Energy conservation demands the relation
Ekin(e−) = hν −(Eion −Ek) .
(7.89)
Compton effect: The X-ray quantum hν “collides” with
a “nearly free” electron, which has a binding energy
Eb ≪hν (see Sect. 3.1.7), transfers only part of its
energy onto the electron, and is inelastically scattered
according to the scheme:
hν + e−→hν′ + e−(Ekin) .
(7.90)
With h(ν −ν′) = Ekin(e−) + Ebind (Fig. 7.34a). The
inelastically scattered photon hν′ can be absorbed by
other atoms of the sample (photoeffect).
Pair formation: For sufﬁciently high energies hν >
1 MeV the X-ray quantum can produce in the material
an electron positron pair (Fig. 7.34b)

two particles must have the same kinetic energy be-
cause they have equal masses. This follows immedi-
ately from the conservation of momentum.
The relative share of the three processes contribut-
ing to the absorption of X-rays strongly depends on the
energy hν. In Fig. 7.35 the contributions of the three
processes are plotted as a function of the photon ener-
gy. This illustrates that for lead the photoeffect is the

ton energy. The total absorption cross section has
a minimum at photon energies around 3 MeV.
The absorption coefﬁcient
α = nσa
(7.92)
is the product of particle density n and absorption cross
section σa. Often the attenuation of incident X-rays is
related to the mass of the absorbing material rather than
to its thickness. With a mass density ρ the product ρx
gives the mass per unit area that is traversed by the
photon along the pathlength x. The equation
e−αx = e−(α/ρ)ρx = e−κa·ρ·x
(7.93)
relates the absorption coefﬁcient α[m−1] with the
mass-absorption coefﬁcient
κa = α
ρ ;
[κa] = 1 m2
kg .
The ratio xe = 1/(κa · ρ) gives the pathlength xe after
which the intensity of the X-rays has decreased to 1/e,
while 1/κa gives that mass per cm2 area perpendicu-
lar to the X-ray direction that decreases the incident
intensity to 1/e. The mass attenuation coefﬁcient κa
depends on the material and on the photon energy hν
(Table 7.4).
EXAMPLE
Lead has a density ρ = 11.3 × 103 kg/m3. For X-
rays with λ = 0.1 nm (≈12 keV) the mass-absorption
coefﬁcient is κa = 7.5 m2/kg. One therefore needs
a mass area density of 0.61 kg/m2 in order to atten-
uate the incident X-rays down to 1% = e−4.6. This
corresponds to a thickness t = 54 μm of a lead sheet.
For X-rays with λ = 0.01 nm (≈120 keV) is κa =
0.5 m2/kg. Now a thickness of t = 0.8 mm is necessary
for the attenuation down to 1%.

of absorption cross section σa and atomic mass ma =
ρ/n, where the absorption cross section
σa = C Z4λ3
(7.95)
strongly depends on the number Z of electrons of each
atom and the wavelength λ.
Experiments show that the absorption cross sec-
tion σa is proportional to the fourth power of
the nuclear charge Z and the third power of the
wavelength λ.
The constant C depends on the absorbing material,
e.g., the packing density of the absorbing atoms and the
number of electrons per atom. For absorbing molecular
samples the absorption cross sections of the molecules
is the sum of the atomic cross sections σa
σam =

σai .
Lead (Z = 82) attenuates X-rays, because of the Z4-
dependence, about 1580 times more than an equal
path length in aluminum (Z = 13), and still 100 times
more than iron (Z = 26). The mass absorption coefﬁ-
cients, however, are only proportional to Z3, because
the atomic masses scale with Z. It is:
n · Z ≈1
2n · A ∝n · ma
⇒κa = σa/ma ∝σa/Z.
For equal masses per irradiation area lead attenuates
about 30 times more than iron.
Plotting the cubic root of the absorption cross sec-
tion σ 1/3
a
as a function of λ over a large wavelength
range (Fig. 7.36) one ﬁnds a straight line as predict-
ed by the relation (7.95). However, at certain wave-
lengths λk, characteristic for the absorbing atoms, the
absorption coefﬁcient jumps suddenly and then fol-
lows a straight line again. This shows that below these
wavelength λk, called the absorption edges, a new ab-
sorption channel is opened. The explanation of this be-
havior is given by Fig. 7.37, which shows schematically

atom with ionization energy EI. For photon energies
hνk < EI −Ek electrons in atomic shells with prin-
cipal quantum numbers n > k can be ionized. These
electrons can all contribute to the absorption cross sec-
tion. When the photon energy exceeds the value hνk
the electrons in shell n = k can be additionally ion-
ized and therefore add to the absorption cross section,
which means that a new absorption channel is opened.
According to the new electron shell accessible to ab-
sorption of the X-ray quanta, the absorption edges are
called K-, L-, or M-edges. Equation (7.95) can be

adapted to the real wavelength dependence of the ab-
sorption cross section by ﬁtting the constants C for
each section between two absorption edges. This yields
different values of C for the different sections.
Plotting the square root ¯ν1/2
k
of the reciprocal wave-
length ¯νk = 1/λk against the nuclear charge number Z
(Fig. 7.38) yields the approximate relation
νk = Kn(Z −S)2 ⇒νk = cKn(Z −S)2 ,
(7.96)
where Kn is a constant depending on the principal
quantum number n, and S is the shielding factor of
the nuclear charge Z · e (see Sect. 6.1.1). These rela-
tions, discovered empirically by Henry G.J. Moseley
(1887–1915), can be immediately explained by the
term energies of the two corresponding levels with
n = k and n = i of the absorbing transition

Fig. 7.38. Moseley diagram of the Z-dependence of the K-
absorption edges
Measuring the wavelengths λn of the different edges
gives the shielding factor S(n) for the corresponding
electron shells with principal quantum number n.
EXAMPLE
For lead (Z = 82) the wavelength at the K-edge is λk =
14.8 pm, which yields the effective nuclear charge
number Zeff = 80.4, corresponding to a shielding con-
stant S = 1.61. The large shielding factor S > 1 shows
that besides the remaining 1s electron, which gives
the main contribution to the shielding, electrons from
higher shells also contribute, since their wave func-
tions ψ(r) have a non-negligible value for r < ⟨r(1s)⟩.
Moseley used his measurements of K absorption
edges to determine the nuclear charge numbers of many
elements, where he assumed the shielding factor to be
S = 1.
Measuring the spectral intervals around the absorp-
tion edges with higher resolution reveals a substructure.
The edges consist of several closely spaced peaks
(Fig. 7.39). The reason for this is the following.
For levels n with an angular momentum J > 0, the
energy levels En split due to two effects. Firstly, levels
with the same principal quantum number n, but dif-
ferent orbital angular momentum quantum numbers L
are degenerate only in the Coulomb potential but have

different energies in the real potential of many-electron
atoms. Secondly, atoms with an electron spin S ̸= 0
split, due to spin-orbit interaction (see Sect. 5.5) in-
to ﬁne-structure components with the same principal
quantum number n, but different values of J = L + S
(see Fig. 7.37). Therefore, the absorption edges also
show these splittings.
The K-shell with n = 1 shows no splitting because
the angular momentum quantum numbers of the ab-
sorbing electron have to be l = 0 and s = 0. The levels
with n = 2 in the L-shell have three sublevels (l = 0;
l = 1, j = 1/2; and l = 1, j = 3/2). Since the ﬁne-
structure splittings increase with Z4 they can reach
values of several keV for heavy elements.
7.5.4 X-ray Fluorescence
If an inner-shell electron is excited from a level Ek
into a higher unoccupied level Ei by electron impact
or by absorption of X-rays, a vacancy is produced in
this inner shell. One of the electrons from higher levels
En > Ek can fall down into the vacancy while a ﬂu-
orescence photon hνnk = En −Ek is emitted, if the
transition is allowed (Fig. 7.31).
For a deﬁnite excitation energy En, one therefore
generally observes in the ﬂuorescence spectrum many
lines with frequencies νik corresponding to all allowed
transitions from levels Ei > Ek into the vacancy in
level Ek (Fig. 7.40). The whole spectrum can be de-
scribed by (7.97), which is similar to the Rydberg
formula (3.91).
Measurements of the wavelengths λik = c/νik of
these lines allows the determination of the energies of
levels in inner shells, which are more difﬁcult to calcu-
late because of strong electron correlation and of the
shielding factors S, which in turn gives information
on the spatial distribution of the wave functions of the
electrons involved (see Sect. 6.4).

X-ray emission of tungsten (from Finkelnburg: Einführung

7.5.5 Measurements of X-Ray Wavelengths
Since the wavelength of X-rays is much smaller than
that of visible light, new techniques had to be devel-
oped for their measurement. One of these methods
uses optical gratings where the X-rays are incident
under very small angles against the grating surface
(Fig. 7.41). If ϑ is the angle between the direction of
the incident parallel X-ray beam and the plane of the
grating, the effective grating constant (i.e., the effective
groove separation) is the projection
deff = d sin ϑ ≈d · ϑ
(7.98)
of the groove distance d onto the incidence direction.
For accurate measurements of the wavelength λ the ef-
fective grating constant deff has to be of the same order
of magnitude than λ.
EXAMPLE
A grating with 1200 grooves per mm has a grat-
ing constant d = 0.83 μm. For ϑ = 10′ ⇒sin ϑ =
3 × 10−3 ⇒deff = 2.5 nm. A wavelength λ = 2.5 nm
corresponds to a photon energy of hν = 0.5 keV.
Wavelengths down to 0.2 nm can be measured this way
with sufﬁcient accuracy.

grazing incidence onto an optical grating with effective grat-
ing constant d sin ϑ and (b) the conditions for the different
diffraction orders

7.5. X-Rays
279
For a given angle of incidence α = 90◦−ϑ against
the grating normal the diffraction angle β is determined
by the grating equation
d(sin α −sin β) = mλ .
(7.99)
This means that in the direction β against the grat-
ing normal the path difference between partial beams
diffracted by adjacent grooves is mλ and therefore
a constructive interference occurs in this direction
(Fig. 7.42). For very small angles ϑ = 90◦−α and
γ = 90◦−β the large angles α and β can only be
measured with less accuracy than ϑ and γ . Inserting ϑ
and γ into (7.99) gives
d[cos ϑ −cos(ϑ + γ )] = mλ .
(7.100)
The mth interference order is observed at the angle δ =
ϑ + γ against the grating plane. The total deﬂection of
the diffracted beam against the incident beam is Δ =
ϑ + δ = 2ϑ + γ . This yields with cos ϑ ≈cos γ ≈1
for the wavelength λ the relation
mλ = 2d sin Δ
2 sin γ
2 ≈d
2 Δ · γ .
(7.101)
Measuring the total deﬂection angle Δ = 2ϑ + γ and
the angle γ between the 0th diffraction order (regular
reﬂection) and the mth order allows the determination
of the X-ray wavelength according to (7.101). The grat-
ing constant d is calibrated by diffraction of visible
light with known wavelength.

Blaze angle Θ and direction of maximum reﬂection
EXAMPLE
d = 0.83 μm, λ = 1 Å = 10−10 m, ϑ = 10′ = 2.8 ×
10−3 rad. The ﬁrst interference order (m = 1) appears
at the angle δ = 1.5 × 10−2 rad against the grating
plane and under the angle Δ = 1.8 × 10−2 rad against
the direction of the incident beam.
At such small angles total reﬂection of the X-rays
occurs, because the refractive index n of materials can
be smaller than that of the vacuum with n = 1. This can
be seen as follows.
The real part n′ of the complex refractive index n =
n′ −iκ is given by (see Problem 7.15)
n2 = 1 +
.
i
N Ze2
ε0me(ω2
i −ω2) ,
(7.102)
where N is the atom number density, ωi are the eigen-
frequencies of absorbing transitions of the atoms in the
sample and me is the mass of the electron. The largest
contribution to the sum comes from the transition with
the highest frequency ωi.
If the frequency ω of the X-rays is higher than all
eigenfrequencies (this implies that λ is smaller than the
K-edge in Fig. 7.36) all terms of the sum in (7.102) be-
come negative and n2 < 1. This means that the sample
has a smaller refractive index than the vacuum or the
air and the X-rays are totally reﬂected if their angle of
incidence α becomes larger than the critical angle αc of
total reﬂection deﬁned by
sin αc = nsample/nair .
EXAMPLE
With λ = 10−10 m ⇒ω ≈2 × 1019 s−1. For copper,
the highest
eigenfrequency
is ω0 = 1 × 1019 s−1,
which gives n′ = 1 −1.3 × 10−5. The critical angle
for total reﬂection is then sin αc = sin(90◦−ϑc) =
nsample/nair = 0.999987, which gives ϑc = 0.3◦=
5 × 10−3 rad.
For all angles α > αc ⇒ϑ < ϑc total reﬂection of
the incident X-rays is observed.
This means that the total incident intensity is re-
ﬂected and distributed among the different diffraction
orders.

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
For spectral regions with n′ < 1 no collecting
lenses, based on refraction, are possible. Any
X-ray optics, therefore, must use the reﬂection
by collimating mirrors, or Fresnel lenses, based
on diffraction and interference.
The most important method for measuring X-ray
wavelengths is Bragg diffraction by single crystals (see
Sect. 2.4.3).
If a plane electromagnetic wave with wavelength λ
falls onto a crystal under an angle ϑ against a crystal
plane (Fig. 7.43) all atoms of the crystal can scatter the
wave. The partial waves from the different atoms inter-
fere constructively, if the path difference between them
is an integer of λ. This gives the Bragg condition
2dc sin ϑ = mλ
(m = 1, 2, . . .) ,
(7.103)
where dc is the distance between adjacent parallel
crystal planes.
The distance dc is calibrated by illuminating the
crystal with X-rays of known wavelength, measured
with the technique, discussed above. When the same
crystal is now irradiated with X-rays of unknown wave-
lengths, they can be determined from measurements of
the angle ϑ, where the maximum diffraction occurs. In
practice, one measures the angle 2ϑ of the deviation
from the incident beam direction.

7.6 Continuous Absorption
and Emission Spectra
Transitions between two bound states of atoms or
molecules always result in line spectra (see Sect. 3.4)
where only discrete frequencies appear in the spectra,
which are determined by energy conservation
hνik = Ei −Ek .
If at least one of the two states is not bound (e.g., if
it lies above the ionization limit of the atom or above
the dissociation energy of the molecule) the emitted or
absorbed radiation shows a continuous spectrum.
EXAMPLES
1. Photoionization of atoms: Here the photon energy
hν is larger than the binding energy EB of the atom-
ic electron. The electron can then leave the atom
with a kinetic energy
Ekin = hν −EB
(7.104)
Varying the frequency ν changes the kinetic en-
ergy accordingly (Fig. 7.44). Every frequency ν
results in an allowed transition and one obtains
a continuous absorption spectrum.
2. The inverse process is the radiative recombination,
where a free electron with kinetic energy Ekin re-
combines with an ion, which ends up in an excited
bound state with binding energy EB, and a photon
with energy
hν = Ekin + EB
(7.105)
is emitted (Fig. 7.45) This results in a continuous
emission spectrum.
3. Bremsstrahlung, discussed in the previous sec-
tion, is an example for transitions between two
unbound states. A free electron with kinetic energy
Ekin = eU in the X-ray tube is decelerated in the
Coulomb ﬁeld of the nucleus of an atom in the
anode and looses the energy ΔE = eU −E′
kin,
where E′
kin is the ﬁnal energy of the electron after
the deceleration.
A second example of bremsstrahlung is the syn-
chrotron radiation emitted by high energy electrons
circulating on a curved path in a magnetic ﬁeld.

We will now discuss such continuous spectra in
more detail.
7.6.1 Photoionization
Measuring the absorption spectrum of an atom in
a bound state Ek < 0 with binding energy EB one
observes with increasing photon energy a series of
absorption lines with frequencies (see Sect. 6.6.4)
νik = −Ek/h −
c · Ry
(ni −δi)2 ,
(7.106)
which become increasingly dense with increasing prin-
cipal quantum number n. They are caused by transi-
tions from level Ek into bound Rydberg levels. The
series converges for n →∞towards the ionization
limit hνc = EB of the atom. For ν > νc the contin-
uous part of the spectrum appears where the atom is
photoionized.
The ions can be collected on the detector with an
efﬁciency of 100% by a small electric ﬁeld. The num-
ber of collected ions is a measure for the number of
absorbed photons.
For a density na of absorbing atoms the measured
ion rate is
˙Nion = na ˙NphσPIVion ,
(7.107)
where σPI is the photoionization cross section, ˙Nph is
the incident photon ﬂux per cm2 and Vion is the ioniza-
tion volume. In Fig. 7.46a the experimental arrange-
ment for the measurements of absorption spectra is
shown and Fig. 7.46b illustrates schematically the ab-
sorption cross section around the transition range from
the discrete to the continuous part of the spectrum.
The absorption coefﬁcient passes smoothly from
the increasingly dense absorption lines into the contin-
uum. Its value in the continuum is given by the square
of the matrix element

7. Emission and Absorption of Electromagnetic Radiation by Atoms
for transitions from a bound state with wave func-
tion ψi into a continuum state with wave function
ψc(E) and energy E. For E →Eion the matrix element
converges towards the matrix element for bound-bound
transitions into Rydberg levels with n →∞.
The following experimental effect, however, pre-
tends a jump of the absorption coefﬁcient.
Because of the long lifetime τn of Rydberg lev-
els En, which increases with n3, the natural linewidths
of high Rydberg levels Δνn = 1/τn becomes very
small. The resolvable spectral interval Δνexp of the
spectrograph in Fig. 7.46a is generally much larger
than Δνn. The measured transmitted intensity for small
absorptions is for a monochromatic incident radiation
It(ν) = I0e−α(ν)L ⇒ΔI(ν) = I0−It ≈α(ν)LI0,
(7.109)
while for radiation with a spectral continuum the ab-
sorbed intensity is
ΔIeff =

Δνexp

ΔI(ν) dν
=
L
Δνexp
ν0+Δνn/2

ν0−Δνn/2
I0α(ν) dν .
(7.110)
Since for continuous radiation the intensity I0 bare-
ly depends on ν within a limited spectral interval, we
can drag I0 out of the integral in (7.110) and obtain
for transitions into Rydberg levels where the absorp-
tion coefﬁcient has only noticeable values within the
linewidth Δνn
ΔIeff ≈LI0α(ν0) Δνn
Δνexp
,
while for transitions into the continuum, all incident
frequencies can be absorbed.
Introducing an effective absorption coefﬁcient αeff,
which reﬂects the true measured absorption
αeff = ΔIeff/(I0L) ,
one obtains from (7.110) for the discrete spectra an
effective absorption coefﬁcient
αeff = α(ν0) Δνn
Δνexp
,
(7.111)
which is smaller than the real absorption coefﬁ-
cient α(νn) at the line center by a factor
Δνn/Δνexp ≪1 .
EXAMPLE
Δνn = 1 MHz, Δνexp = 1 GHz = 103 MHz ⇒αeff =
10−3α(νn).
Because of the ﬁnite spectral resolution of the spec-
trograph the different lines of the Rydberg spectrum
can no longer be resolved for large values of the prin-
cipal quantum number n. In this case, one measures
a superposition of several Rydberg transitions and the
apparent spectrum seems to be continuous. This shifts
the experimentally observed ionization limit to smaller
frequencies.
A way out of this deﬁciency is the measurement
of the photo ions instead of the transmitted intensi-
ty. Another solution is provided by laser spectroscopy
where the natural linewidth can be resolved (see
Sect. 10.5).
For transitions into the true continuum is Δνn =
Δνexp, because all frequencies contribute to the ab-
sorption and the above-mentioned problem does not
arise.
For doubly excited atoms where two electrons are in
excited states (e.g., ns, 2p for the helium atom, where
one electron is in Rydberg levels ns and the other in
the 2p state), the ionization limit for one of the two ex-
cited electrons appears at a higher total energy than for
singly excited atoms (Fig. 7.47). The difference is just
the excitation energy of the second electron. For our
example, the ionization limit is shifted upwards by the
excitation energy of the 2p electron. For the He atom
doubly excited states (ns, 2p) are already for n = 4
above the ionization limit of singly excited He atoms
(ns, 1s). These doubly excited states can decay by au-
toionization (see Sect. 6.5), where, due to a correlation
between the two electron the electron in the 2p state
transfers its energy to the Rydberg electron, which can
then leave the atom while the 2p-electron falls back
into the 1s ground state.
Measuring the absorption spectrum of an atom
above its ionization limit, one observes resonances
at the energies of doubly excited states that are

superimposed on the continuum. They are due to au-
toionization. The line proﬁles of these resonances have
been studied and explained theoretically by U. Fano
and are therefore called Fano proﬁles (Fig. 7.48). They
can be understood from the following consideration:
The absorption of a photon reaches two states at
the same energy E: the doubly excited discrete state
with a level width ΔE and the interval ΔE around E
in the continuum. The wave function of these superim-
posed states is written for our He example as the linear
combination
ψ = c1ψk(ns, 2p) + c2ψc(E) .

contains the interference term
2c1c2Mic · Mi(ns, 2p),
which depends on the energy difference ΔE = Econt −
E(ns, 2p). While the phase of the continuous wave
function depends only weakly on the energy, that of the
doubly excited state depends strongly on ΔE, because
it changes by π, when tuning across the resonance
proﬁle. If both wave functions are in phase, the ab-
sorption cross section becomes maximal, if they have
opposite phases the interference is destructively and the
absorption becomes minimal.
Fano and Cooper [7.15, 16] have shown that the en-
ergy dependence of the absorption cross section around
an autoionization resonance can be described by [7.17]
σ(E) = σa
(ε + q)2
1 + ε2 + σb ,
(7.114)
where ε = ΔE/(Γ/2) = (E −Er)/(Γ/2) is the ener-
gy difference in units of the halfwidth Γ/2 of the
resonance, σa is the absorption cross section for the ab-
sorption by the doubly excited state (unperturbed by
autoionization) and σb is the background absorption of
the direct excitation into the continuum (Fano proﬁle
Fig. 7.49).
The Fano parameter q [7.18] stands for the ratio
q = −
D1
D2R12
of the transition amplitude D1 to the perturbed bound
state and the product D2R12 of the transition amplitude
D2 to the continuum and the coupling R12 between
both states. In fact, this product gives the transition am-
plitude for reaching the continuum state via the bound
state. If the transition moments for the two different
path ways from the ground state to the continuum
state have equal amplitudes but opposite phases, the
two contributions cancel each other and the absorption
cross section becomes zero [7.17].

The width Γ = 1/τ (full width at half maximum)
is determined by the lifetime τ of the doubly excit-
ed state. Since radiative transitions into lower bound
states of the atom have a small probability, the lifetime
of autoionizing states is mainly limited by the fast auto
ionization process. Typical values for atoms range from
τ = 10−12–10−14 s.
7.6.2 Recombination Radiation
A free electron with velocity v can be captured by an
atom or ion into a bound state with binding energy EB.
The energy released at this process can be converted
into radiation with a photon energy
hν = Ekin −Ei = me
2 v2 −Ei (Ei < 0) .
(7.115)
This process is called two-body recombination or ra-
diative recombination, contrary to three-body recom-
bination, where the excess energy can be transferred
to a third particle, which also takes care of momentum
conservation. The three-body recombination, where no
radiation is emitted, becomes signiﬁcant at higher den-
sities of electrons and atoms or ions, because three
collision partners have to meet at the same time.
The inverse process of autoionization is the dielec-
tronic recombination. Here a free electron is captured
by an atom and the recombination energy is not emitted
as radiation but transformed to another bound electron
of the atom which is promoted into a higher bound
energy level [7.21].
The radiative recombination plays an important role
in gas discharges and in other low density plasmas such
as in stellar atmospheres. The cross section for electron
capture into an atomic state Ei depends on the relative
velocity of the two collision partners.
We will consider as an example a low density
plasma at local thermal equilibrium with atom or ion
density na and electron density ne. The electron den-
sity within the velocity interval between v and v + dv
is ne(v), where
ne =

ne(v) dv .
The recombination rate is
˙NR = na

ne(v)σR(v)v dv
(7.116)
and one photon is emitted per recombination event.
In a plasma the velocity distribution of the elec-
trons depends on the electron temperature Te, which is
generally higher than the ion temperature Tion.
In Fig. 7.50 the dependence of the recombination
cross section on the electron temperature is plotted on a
double logarithmic scale for two different electron den-
sities. For low densities the recombination rate is low
and nearly independent of temperature, while for high
electron densities it falls drastically with increasing
temperature.
In a plasma at thermal equilibrium with atomic den-
sity na the recombination radiation is isotropic. The

The continuous emission spectrum of our sun, rep-
resented by the Planck distribution (3.15) with a tem-
perature of about 5800 K, is an important example for
a recombination continuum. The visible and infrared
part of it is mainly due to the recombination of neutral
hydrogen atoms and electrons, according to the scheme
H + e−(Ekin) →H−+ hν ,
(7.122b)
where negative H−ions are formed. These H−ions
loose their electron by collisions with electrons
H−+ e−→H∗+ 2e−,
which replenishes the supply of neutral H atoms, used
again for the recombination process (7.122).
Besides the process (7.122), the recombination of
protons and electrons is also present
H+ + e−(Ekin) →H∗+ hν .
(7.122c)
The recombination radiation from this process mainly
contributes to the UV part of the continuous spectrum
of our sun.

•
The frequencies νik absorbed or emitted by atoms
νik = (Ei −Eκ) /h
are determined by the energies Ei, Ek of the
atomic states connected by the radiative transition.
•
The relation between the probability wν Bik of
absorption by an atom in a radiation ﬁeld with
spectral energy density wν and wν Bki of induced
emission is gk Bki = gi Bik, where gi and gk are
the statistical weights of the levels, i.e., the num-
ber of different wave functions representing this
level.
If the total angular momentum quantum number
is J the statistical weight is g = (2J + 1).
•
The relation between the Einstein coefﬁcients Bik
and Aik is Aik = (8πν3/c3)Bik.
In a radiation ﬁeld with one photon per mode
the spontaneous radiation probability equals the
induced emission probability. In thermal radia-
tion ﬁelds at achievable temperatures, the number
of photons per mode n ≪1 is very small in the
range from near infrared to UV. Here, the spon-
taneous emission is therefore by far the dominant
emission.
•
The radiation power absorbed or emitted on
a transition Ei →Ek is proportional to the abso-
lute square of the transition dipole matrix element
Mik = e

ψ∗
i rψk dτ ,
which depends on the wave functions ψi, ψk of
the corresponding atomic states. Mik represents
the quantum mechanical average of the classical
dipole moment in the two atomic states.
•
An electric dipole transition is only allowed, if
the selection rules ΔL = ±1, ΔML = 0, ±1, and
ΔJ = 0 ± 1 are obeyed, but J = 0 →J = 0 is
forbidden. Here L is the orbital angular momen-
tum quantum number ML its projection and J
the quantum number of total angular momentum
J = L + S.
•
For all light atoms (small Z) only transitions
occur, where the spin quantum number S does
not change (ΔS = 0). For atoms with large Z
spin-orbit coupling allows weak transitions with
ΔS ̸= 0.
•
Besides electric dipole transitions, higher order
transitions, such as electric quadrupole transitions
or magnetic dipole transitions, can also occur,
but with probabilities that are smaller by several
orders of magnitude.
•
The mean lifetime τi = 1/Ai of an excited atomic
level ⟨i| with energy Ei is given by the inverse
Einstein coefﬁcient Ai of spontaneous emission
on allowed transitions from ⟨i| into all other lev-
els ⟨j| with energies E j < Ei. Measurements of
level lifetimes therefore allow the determination
of transition probabilities and matrix elements.
They represent a crucial test of the accuracy of
calculated wave functions.
•
The effective lifetimes are determined by the sum
of radiative decay and inelastic collision probabil-
ities. Inelastic collisions shorten the natural life-
time of an atomic level. Elastic collisions perturb
the level energies of the emitting atom.

X-rays are electromagnetic waves with wave-
lengths in the range of 10 nm to 0.1 nm. The mea-
surement of these wavelengths can be achieved by
Bragg reﬂection or diffraction in single crystals
or with optical diffraction gratings under gracing
incidence.
•
X-rays are produced:
By decelerating electrons with energies in the keV
range (continuous emission of bremsstrahlung)
By transitions of atomic electrons from higher
energy states in vacant inner shell states (charac-
teristic X-ray emission)

Problems

•
X-rays are absorbed by:
The photo-effect A + hν →A∗
The Compton effect hν + e−→hν′ + e−+ Ekin
Pair formation hν →e−+ e+.
The relative probabilities of these processes de-
pend on the energy hν of the X-ray photons.
•
Continuous absorption spectra of atoms are
observed
for
the
photoionization
of
atoms.
Continuous emission spectra are generated by ra-
diative recombination of free electrons with ions
or neutral atoms. Another source of continuous
radiation is produced when free electrons are
decelerated either in the Coulomb ﬁeld of atoms
(bremsstrahlung) or when high energy electrons
(MeV –GeV) are forced, using a magnetic ﬁeld,
onto circular paths (synchrotron radiation).
•
The continuous spectrum of our sun in the vis-
ible and infrared part is produced by radiative
recombination

8. Lasers
Laser is an acronym for Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimu-
lated Emission of Radiation that describes the basic
physical principle of its operation. Gordon, Zeiger and
Townes [8.1] showed for the ﬁrst time in 1955 that a mi-
crowave could be ampliﬁed by NH3 molecules on the
inversion transition at λ = 1.26 cm (Fig. 4.13) if these
molecules were prepared in such a way that the upper
level of the transition had a larger population than the
lower one. With such inverted NH3 molecules inside
a microwave cavity, the ﬁrst “maser” (microwave am-
pliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation) could
be operated.
Schawlow and Townes published a paper in 1958
with detailed discussions of how the maser principle
might be extended into the visible spectral range [8.2].
The ﬁrst experimental realization of a laser was demon-
strated in 1960 by Maiman, who built a ruby laser,
which was pumped by a helical ﬂashlamp and emitted
coherent radiation at λ = 694 nm [8.3].
Since then, lasers have been developed spanning
the whole spectral range from the far infrared down
to the vacuum ultraviolet region. They have proved to
be valuable tools not only for the solution of many
scientiﬁc problems but also for numerous technical
applications.
In this chapter we will discuss the basic physical
principles of lasers, the most important classes of lasers
and some interesting novel applications. More detailed
discussions can be found in the vast literature on lasers
[8.4–7].

the photon number becomes Nphot ≫1. Therefore,
in these modes, the induced emission becomes
much larger than the spontaneous emission (see
Sect. 7.1.1). The optical resonator furthermore
reﬂects the induced emission back into the active
medium and allows many paths back and forth
through the medium, thus realizing a long ampli-
ﬁcation path. This converts the light ampliﬁer into
a light oscillator if the total ampliﬁcation exceeds
the total losses.
8.1.1 Threshold Condition
When an electromagnetic wave with frequency ν trav-
els in the z direction through a medium (Fig. 8.3) its
intensity changes according to Beer’s absorption law
I(ν, z) = I(ν, 0) · e−α(ν)·z .
(8.1)
The frequency-dependent absorption coefﬁcient
α(ν) = [Nk −(gk/gi)Ni]σ(ν)
(8.2)
is determined by the absorption cross section σ(ν) of
the transition Nk →Ni, the population densities Ni,
Nk, of the levels with energies Ei, Ek with ΔE = Ei −
Ek = hν, and their statistical weights gi, gk (the statis-
tical weight of a level with total angular momentum
quantum number J is g = 2J + 1). For
Ni > (gi/gk)Nk ⇒α(ν) < 0
(8.2a)
this means that the transmitted wave will be ampli-
ﬁed instead of attenuated. Such a deviation (8.2a) from
a thermal equilibrium population is called inversion
and the medium where this inversion is realized is
called the active medium.
When the active medium with length L is placed
between two parallel mirrors (Fig. 8.1) the light wave
is reﬂected back and forth and passes through the active
medium many times, where it is ampliﬁed each time by
the factor

(8.3)
which is larger than 1 for α(ν) < 0.
Unfortunately there are also losses that attenuate the
wave. These are reﬂection, diffraction, absorption, and
scattering losses (Fig. 8.4).
Reﬂection losses. A mirror with reﬂection coefﬁcient
R only reﬂects the fraction R < 1 of the incident
intensity. If absorption losses of the mirror can be ne-
glected, the fraction (1 −R) of the incident intensity is
transmitted through the mirror.
Absorption and scattering losses. In case of gas lasers,
the windows of the tube containing the active medium
may absorb and scatter some of the transmitted light.
For solid lasers the end surfaces of the laser rod may
scatter and reﬂect some light. Also, the active medium
might not have a spatially uniform inversion, leaving
locations with α > 0. Finally, the mirror surfaces are
not perfect. They can scatter light and the reﬂecting
layers can also show small absorptions.
Diffraction losses. Depending on the parameters of the
optical resonator (aperture diameter a, mirror separa-
tion d and radius of curvature r of the mirrors) the wave
being reﬂected back and forth shows an angular spread
due to diffraction (see below). This means that only part
of the intensity is reﬂected back into the active medi-
um, which represents a diffraction loss per roundtrip
through the resonator.
We will describe the sum of all these losses per
roundtrip by the loss factor γ . The intensity after one
roundtrip has decreased (without ampliﬁcation by the
active medium) by the factor e−γ :
I(2d)
I(0) = e−γ
with
γ = γr + γsc + γdif .

G(ν) = I(ν, 2d)
I(ν, 0) = e−(2α(ν)·L+γ ) .
(8.5)
For G(ν) > 1 the ampliﬁcation overcomes the losses
and the light ampliﬁer becomes a light oscillator.
According to (8.2) and (8.5) the threshold condition
for starting the self-sustained oscillation (i.e., the laser
oscillator) is
2α(ν) · L + γ ≤0 .
(8.5a)
Inserting (8.2) this gives
2[Nk −(gk/gi)Ni] · σ(ν) · L + γ ≤0 .
(8.5b)
The minimum inversion ΔN = Ni(gk/gi) −Nk for
lasing must therefore fulﬁll the threshold condition
ΔNthr = Ni(gk/gi) −Nk ≥ΔNthr
=
γ (ν)
2σ(ν) · L
.
(8.6)
If the energy transfer from the pump into the active
medium is sufﬁciently strong to achieve ΔN >
ΔNthreshold the light will be ampliﬁed for each
roundtrip, because the ampliﬁcation exceeds all losses.
Note:
The larger the product of absorption cross section
σ(ν) times absorption pathlength L the smaller is the
threshold inversion ΔNthr.
The laser oscillation for a continuous laser with
time-independent pump power builds up in the follow-
ing way.
Fluorescence photons, spontaneously emitted by
the upper level Ei into the direction of the resonator
axis are reﬂected back into the active medium, where
they are ampliﬁed, reﬂected back into the medium by
the rear mirror, etc. This results in a photon avalanche
with increasing photon number after each roundtrip, if
G(ν) > 1 (Fig. 8.5). Part of this radiation power, circu-
lating between the two resonator mirrors is transmitted
by one of the mirrors. With increasing photon number
the probability of induced emission increases, which
decreases the population inversion until it is depleted
down to the threshold value. Here, gain and losses
are just equal and the laser has reached its stationary
state, where the emission is constant. The emitted laser

Fig. 8.5. Photon avalanche generated by a photon passing
through the active medium due to induced emission
power depends on the pump power and the pumping
efﬁciency.
For pulsed lasers the pump power is time-
dependent. After a certain pumping time the thresh-
old inversion has been reached. Now laser oscillation
starts, which depletes the inversion due to induced
emission. The time dependence of the laser output
power depends on the relative rates +dNi/dt of pump-
ing and −d(Ni −Nk)/dt of inversion depletion by
induced emission. For sufﬁciently strong pumping the
laser output power follows the time-dependent pump
power and a laser pulse is emitted that is shorter than
the pump pulse because it only starts after inversion
has been reached and ends when the pump power falls
below the threshold value (Fig. 8.6).

In cases of strong depletion by stimulated emission
the inversion drops below the threshold already during
the pump pulse and the laser emission stops, until
the pump has again built up sufﬁcient inversion. Now
the laser emission starts again. In such cases (e.g., for
the ruby laser) the laser output consists of more or less
irregular spikes with short durations, which are emitted
while the pump power is above threshold (Fig. 8.7).
The ampliﬁcation factor is largest for photons with
the longest path through the active medium. These
are those photons that travel along the resonator axis.
Photons emitted into directions inclined to the axis, are
not reﬂected back into the active medium and are there-
fore less ampliﬁed (Fig. 8.8). If their ampliﬁcation does
not reach the threshold value, they cannot contribute
to the laser oscillation. Depending on the geometric
dimensions of the active medium and the limiting aper-
tures of the optical resonator the laser oscillation is
restricted to a small angular divergence around the res-
onator axis. This results in a laser beam, transmitted
through one of the resonator mirrors, which has a small
divergence and appears in many cases as nearly parallel
light beam with a small diameter.

8.1.2 Generation of Population Inversion
The minimum inversion, required for laser oscillation,
can be achieved by a selective pump process, that pop-
ulates the upper level Ei of the laser transition more
strongly than the lower level Ek. The pump energy can
be transferred either as a pulse (e.g., by ﬂashlamps) or
continuously (e.g., by electron impact in a stationary
gas discharge). In the ﬁrst case, laser emission occurs as
a pulse, in the second case it occurs continuously (cw =
continuous wave operation). We will provide examples
of both cases.
The ﬂashlamp-pumped ruby laser historically rep-
resents the ﬁrst demonstration of pulsed laser opera-
tion. Its active medium is a cylindrical rod consisting of
an Al2O3 crystal, that is doped with about 1% Cr+++
ions. The level scheme of these Cr+++ ions is shown
in Fig. 8.9. By absorption of light from the ﬂash-
lamp the ions are pumped from the ground state E0
into the levels E1 and E2, which are strongly broad-
ened by interaction of the excited Cr+++-ions with
the host crystal. The resulting broad absorption lines
overlap with the maximum of the spectral continuum
emitted by the ﬂashlamp ﬁlled with xenon and can
therefore be effectively pumped. The two upper levels
transfer part of their excitation energy in a very short
time (10−10–10−11 s) to vibrational energy of the crys-
tal due to a strong interaction with their surroundings.
This loss of excitation energy results in fast radia-
tionless transitions into a sharp lower level Ei, which
is the upper level of the laser transition Ei →E0 at
λ = 694 nm.
In order to achieve population inversion, the num-
ber of Cr+++ ions in the level Ei must be larger
than that in the ground state E0. A direct pumping of

level Ei on a transition E0 →Ei could not achieve
inversion, because as soon as the populations of both
levels become equal, the absorption of the pump light
on the laser transition becomes zero and the pump can
no longer populate level Ei. The intermediate levels
E1 and E2 are therefore essential for the realization
of laser oscillation. One needs at least three levels, as
indicated in Fig. 8.9 by the encircled numbers (where
E1 and E2 have been combined into a single level).
Such a level scheme for laser operation is called a three
level system. The ruby laser is therefore a three level
laser.
Note:
Under special conditions it is also possible to achieve
inversion for a short time in a two-level system, if the
pumping time is short compared to all relaxation times
of the system and even shorter than the Rabi oscilla-
tion time TR = π · h/(Mik · E(νik)), where Mik is the
matrix element for the transition i →k and E is the
electric ﬁeld vector of the pump wave. These condi-
tions, however, apply only to very few real systems that
are specially designed.
There are several possible experimental conﬁgura-
tions of the ruby laser using linear or helical ﬂashlamps
(Fig. 8.10). While Maiman used the helical design
for his ﬁrst laser, nowadays the linear conﬁguration
is preferred. Here the cylindrical ruby rod and the
linear ﬂashlamp are placed along the two focal lines
of a cylindrical reﬂector with elliptical cross section
(Fig. 8.10a). The light emitted by the ﬂashlamp is
focused into the ruby rod from all sides, due to the
imaging characteristics of the pump light reﬂector with
elliptical cross section. The mirror surface is coated
with dielectric layers with maximum reﬂection at those
wavelengths preferentially absorbed by the Cr+++ ions
on the transitions E0 →E1, E2. The parallel end faces
of the ruby rod are polished and one end face is coated
with a highly reﬂecting layer, the other endface for
the laser output with a partially transmitting layer.
The ﬂashlamp is ﬁred by discharging a high voltage
capacitor through the lamp. While the pump pulse lasts
for approximately 1–3 ms, the laser output is a pulse
of typically 0.2–0.4 ms, generally consisting of many
short (≈1 μs) spikes.

Our second example is the He-Ne-laser, which rep-
resents the most commonly used cw gas laser. This
laser is based on a four-level system and the pump-
ing is achieved by inelastic collisions of electrons with
helium and neon atoms in a stationary gas discharge in
a glass tube. Its principle design is shown in Fig. 8.11.
A gas discharge is initiated by a high voltage between
a cylindrical anode and an aluminum cathode surround-
ing a glass or quartz capillary (1–4 mm diameter). The
power supply for a He-Ne laser has a typical output of
5–10 mA at a voltage of 1 kV. The whole tube is ﬁlled
with a mixture of about 88% He and 12% Ne at a total
pressure of 1–5 mbar. In this discharge (in particular in
the narrow capillary, where the current density is high),
He and Ne atoms are excited into many high lying en-
ergy levels. Most of these levels have a short lifetime
and decay by spontaneous emission. In the helium atom
there are two metastable states with long lifetimes (see
Sect. 6.2). These are the 2 3S1(τ = 20 ms) state and the
2 1S0 state (τ ⩾600 s), which cannot decay by allowed
dipole transitions into lower states. They are populated

not only by electron impact but also by cascading spon-
taneous emissions from higher levels (Fig. 8.12). In the
discharge, therefore, a high concentration of He-atoms
in these states is built up.
The electron conﬁguration of excited states in neon
is 1s2 2s2 2p5 n′l′, with n′ = 3, 4, 5, . . .. In “Paschen-
notation” (L-S-coupling) the sublevels of each con-
ﬁguration are numbered with decreasing energy.
For example the 2p5 3p conﬁguration has ten sub-
levels 2S+1L J, which are (with decreasing energy)
1S0,3P1,3P0,3P2,1P1,1D2,3D1,3D2,3D3 and 3S1 num-
bered by 1, 2, . . . 10.
Both metastable He states are in close energy reso-
nance with excited neon levels. By collisions between

excited He atoms and ground state Ne atoms this en-
ergy resonance results in large cross sections for the
collisional transfer of the excitation energy from the
He to the Ne atoms (near resonance collisions of the
second kind) according to the scheme:
He∗(2 1S0) + Ne(2 1S0) →He(1 1S0) + Ne∗(5s)
(8.7)
He∗(2 3S1) + Ne(11S0) →He(1 1S0) + Ne∗(4s)
This energy transfer results in a selective excitation
of the neon levels 4s and 5s, which achieve a higher
population than the lower levels 4p and 5p, resulting
in a population inversion on the transitions 5s →5p
(λ = 3.39 μm), 4s →4p (λ = 1.15 μm) and 5s →
4p (λ = 633 nm). Such a system, where the laser tran-
sition occurs between two excited states, and four
levels are involved (the He ground state, a metastable
He state and the two Ne levels) is called a four-level
system. In Fig. 8.12 the sublevel numbers, explained
above, of upper and lower laser levels is indicated on
the right side.
Since the population of the lower laser levels is
very small, only a small percentage (≈10−5) of all He
atoms needs to be excited into the metastable states,
contrary to the three level system of the ruby laser
where more than 50% of all Cr+++-ions had to be
pumped into the upper laser level. Therefore only about
10−6 of all neon atoms occupy the upper levels of the
laser transitions.
The level scheme shows that laser oscillation is pos-
sible for several transitions with different wavelengths.
However, only those transitions can reach laser thresh-
old, for which the gain exceeds the losses. The losses
can be selected by a proper choice of the resonator mir-
rors. If the reﬂection of these mirrors is high for one
wavelength but low for the others, laser oscillation can
only occur at this favored wavelength.
The gain on the transition 5s →4p (λ = 633 nm)
reaches only a few percent for a length of 20 cm in
the active medium. Therefore the losses have to be
correspondingly low and laser operation could only
be achieved after high reﬂecting dielectric mirrors had
been designed with reﬂectivities of 99.99% for one
mirror and 98% for the transmitting mirror. The gain
can be increased by using the isotope 3He instead of
4He, because here the energy resonance between the
metastable He levels and the excited Ne levels is even
closer than in 4He and therefore the cross section for
energy transfer from He to Ne is larger.

8.1.3 The Frequency Spectrum
of Induced Emission
Both the gain −α(ν) · L and the losses γ (ν) depend
on the frequency ν of the light wave. When the
pump process starts, the laser reaches the threshold
ﬁrst for those frequencies where the threshold inver-
sion ΔNthr is minimum. The frequency dependence of
the gain depends on the active medium. For gaseous
media (He-Ne-laser, Ar+-laser) the spectral lines are
Doppler-broadened, showing a Gaussian line proﬁle
with a width of several GHz (109 Hz). For solid state
lasers or liquid lasers the line width is mainly de-
termined by interaction of the laser atoms, ions or
molecules with their surroundings. It is generally much
broader than in gases.
The loss factor γ mainly depends on the charac-
teristics of the optical resonator. It has minima at the
resonance frequencies of the resonator. Therefore las-
ing starts at those resonator resonances that lie within
the spectral gain proﬁle of the active medium. If the
spacing between resonator modes is smaller than the
spectral width of the gain proﬁle, the laser oscillates on
several wavelengths simultaneously. This deteriorates
the coherence properties of the laser emission. If os-
cillation on a single wavelength is required, additional
wavelength selecting elements have to be introduced.
This can be realized either by a special resonator de-
sign or by prisms or optical gratings inside or outside
the resonator.
Since the laser resonator plays a central role for the
spectral characteristics of laser emission, we will ﬁrst
discuss optical resonators.
8.2 Optical Resonators
In Sect. 3.1.2 it was shown that inside a closed res-
onator a radiation ﬁeld can exist with an energy density
wν(ν) that is equally distributed over all resonances or
modes of the cavity. In the optical spectral range where
the wavelength λ is small compared to the dimensions
of the cavity, the number of modes within the frequency
interval dν is (see (3.10b))
n(ν) dν = 8π(ν2/c3) dν .
For ν = 5 × 1014 s−1 (λ = 600 nm) the number of
modes within a Doppler broadened spectral line (Δν =
109 s−1) is n(ν)Δν = 2.5 × 1014 m−3. This implies
that the spontaneous emission from excited atoms in-
side a closed cavity is distributed over many modes,
which means that the average photon number per mode
is very small. In such a closed cavity the induced
emission, started by spontaneous photon avalanches, is
spread out over many modes. Because the total power
emitted by spontaneous and induced emission has to be
supplied by the pump energy, one needs an exceedingly
high pump power in order to achieve laser oscillation
on all these modes. The laser emission would then
be distributed over many directions into the solid an-
gle 4π and the directionality of laser emission would
be lost.
Closed cavities, which are used for the realization
of masers in the microwave region, where λ is
comparable with the cavity dimensions, are not
suitable for optical lasers.
8.2.1 The Quality Factor of Resonators
Assume that the kth resonator mode contains the radi-
ation energy Wk(t). If no energy is fed from external
sources into this mode, its stored energy will decrease
as
dWk
dt
= −βk · Wk ,
(8.8)
which yields the time-dependent stored energy
Wk(t) = Wk(0) · e−βkt
(8.9)
with the loss factor βk. After the time τ = 1/βk the
energy stored in the kth mode has decayed to 1/e of its
initial value at t = 0. This time can be regarded as the
mean lifetime of a photon stored in this resonator mode.
We deﬁne the quality factor Qk of the kth resonator
mode as 2π times the ratio of the energy, stored in this
mode to the energy loss per oscillation period T = 1/ν
of the radiation with frequency ν:
Qk = −2πν · Wk
dWk/dt .
(8.10)
Inserting (8.8) and (8.9) gives the relation between the
loss factor βk and the quality factor Qk:
Qk = 2πν/βk .
(8.11)

296
8. Lasers
Since the round trip time in a resonator with mirror sep-
aration d is T = 2d/c the loss factor γ per roundtrip is
then
γk = βk · (2d/c) .
(8.12)
Even if at t = 0 the radiation energy, supplied by spon-
taneous emission, is the same for all modes, those
modes with a high Q-factor will store this energy for
a longer time while those with a low Q-factor loose
their energy after a short time.
8.2.2 Open Optical Resonators
In order to concentrate the induced emission onto a few
modes, the Q-factor of the resonator must be large for
these modes (i.e., the losses must be small), while it
should be sufﬁciently small for all other modes, so
that for a given pump power the threshold for laser
oscillation is not reached for these modes.
Open resonators, consisting of a suitable arrange-
ment of optical mirrors can fulﬁll this condition. We
will illustrate this by the example of two plane-parallel
mirrors M1 and M2 with reﬂectivity R1 and R2 and
with diameters 2a, which are separated by the dis-
tance d (Fig. 8.4). This represents, in fact, a Fabry-
Perot interferometer (FPI) used in spectroscopy as
a spectral ﬁlter with high resolution. There is, how-
ever, an essential difference from conventional FPI,
where the mirror separation d is small compared to
the diameter 2a of the mirrors. For the laser resonator
the situation is the opposite: here d ≫2a. This makes
a large difference with respect to diffraction, which is
negligible in a conventional FPI, but essential in a laser
resonator.
We will ﬁrst regard the reﬂection losses.
A light wave reﬂected back and forth between
the mirrors suffers reﬂection losses and its intensity
decreases per roundtrip according to
I(2d) = I0R1R2 = I0 · e−γr .
(8.13)
The reﬂection loss factor γr is deﬁned as
γr = −ln(R1R2) .
(8.14)
Since the transit time for one roundtrip is T = 2d/c,
the mean lifetime τ of a photon stored in the resonator
and traveling along the resonator axis is
τ =
2d
c · ln(R1R2)
(8.15)
if no other losses were present.
EXAMPLE
R1 = 1, R2 = 0.98, d = 0.5 m ⇒γr = 0.02 and τ =
1.5 × 10−7 s.
We will now discuss the diffraction losses of open
resonators.
Because of the ﬁnite diameter 2a ≪d of the mir-
rors diffraction losses are generally not negligible.
This is illustrated by Fig. 8.13c. A plane wave trav-
eling from below onto the mirror M1 is no longer

bic closed resonator compared with curved wave fronts in an

reﬂected as a plane wave but becomes divergent be-
cause of diffraction. This is completely analogous to
a plane wave passing through an aperture with diame-
ter 2a (Fig. 8.13b). Here the transmitted wave shows an
intensity proﬁle

with a central maximum and higher diffraction or-
ders (see textbooks on optics). The central diffraction
maximum has an angular width between the ﬁrst two
nodes of the Bessel function J1(x) on both sides of the
maximum at x = 0, which gives
sin Θ = 1.2λ/(2a) ⇒Θ ≈λ/(1.7a) .
(8.17a)
Light with larger diffraction angles does not hit the mir-
ror M2 in Fig. 8.13c and is therefore lost. If the total
light power included in the 0th diffraction order, should
be reﬂected by M2 the diffraction angle Θ has to obey
the relation
tan Θ · d ≈Θ · d ≤a .
Inserting (8.17a) yields
1.7 a2
λ · d ≥1 .
(8.17b)
The ratio
NF = a2/(λd)
(8.18)
is called the Fresnel number of the resonator. It gives
the number of Fresnel zones on the surface of M1,
which can be seen from the center A of M2 (Fig. 8.14).
A more detailed calculation shows [8.8, 9] that for
NF ≫1 the diffraction loss factor is γd ≈1/N. This
means that in a resonator with Fresnel number NF
the light power drops after one roundtrip by a factor
exp(−1/N) if only diffraction losses were present.
When the light wave makes m roundtrips, the Fresnel
number should be NF > m · γR if the diffraction losses
are to be smaller than the reﬂection losses.
EXAMPLE
For a FPI with a = 2 cm and d = 1 cm, typically for
spectroscopic applications, the Fresnel number for λ =
500 nm is NF = 8 × 104. The diffraction loss factor
is γd = 1.2 × 10−5 and diffraction losses are therefore
negligible. The phase fronts of a wave inside the FPI
are planes and the mirror surfaces are nodal planes of
the standing wave. These dimensions are, however, not
suitable for a laser resonator.
The resonator of a gas laser with plane mirrors (di-
ameter 2a = 0.2 cm and a separation of d = 50 cm) has
for λ = 500 nm a Fresnel number NF = 4. The diffrac-
tion losses per roundtrip amount already to 25% and
a He-Ne-laser with such a resonator would not reach
threshold.
8.2.3 Modes of Open Resonators
While the modes of closed cavities can be described as
a superposition of plane waves (see Sect. 3.1.2) with
amplitudes and phases that are constant on planes per-
pendicular to the wave vector k, in open resonators
both quantities are changing across these planes be-
cause the diffraction causes a curvature of the wave
fronts. Possible modes of open resonators are therefore
not plane waves!
The amplitude and phase distribution A(x, y) and
ϕ(x, y) of modes in an open resonator with the res-
onator axis in z-direction can be determined in the
following way.

Fig. 8.15. The diffraction of a wave traveling back and forth
between two mirrors M1 and M2 is equivalent to that of
a wave passing through a series of equidistant apertures
The light wave being reﬂected back and forth be-
tween the two resonator mirrors corresponds to, regard-
ing the diffraction effects, a wave passing in z-direction
through a series of equidistant apertures with the same
size as the mirrors (Fig. 8.15). This is shown in op-
tics by Babinet’s theorem. When a plane wave passes
through the ﬁrst aperture in the plane z = 0 the ampli-
tude distribution A(x, y) will change due to diffraction.
The amplitude will at ﬁrst decrease more at the edges
than in the center, until the diffraction losses are equal
for all values of x and y. We assume that after having
passed the nth aperture, the diffracted wave will have
reached a stationary state, where the relative amplitude
distribution A(x, y) will no longer change, although
the absolute total amplitude may still decrease. This
implies the relation:
An(x, y) = C · An−1(x, y)
(8.19)
where the constant C with |C| < 1 does not depend on
x and y.
The amplitude distribution An(x, y) across the
nth aperture can be calculated from the distribu-
tion An−1(x′, y′) across the foregoing aperture, using
Kirchhoff’s diffraction theory. The light emitted by ev-
ery point (x′, y′) contributes to the amplitude A(x, y) in
the nth aperture. From Fig. 8.16 we obtain the relation

(8.19) is found to be
C = (1 −γd)1/2 · eiϕ
(8.21)
where γB is the diffraction factor, and ϕ is the phase
shift, caused by the curvature of the wave fronts, due to
diffraction.
Some solutions of the integral equation (8.20)
are illustrated in Fig. 8.17. They correspond to sta-
tionary solutions as standing waves between the two
resonator mirrors and are called transverse electro-
magnetic (TEM) modes of the open resonator. They
are labeled by three indices, which give the num-
ber of nodes of the standing wave in the x-, y-, and
z-directions (Fig. 8.18). The TEM0,0,q modes with
no nodes in x- and y-direction are called funda-
mental modes. Their k-vector points into the ±z-
direction and they have q nodes along the z-axis
where q = 2d/λ. Their electric ﬁeld amplitude distri-
bution E(x, y) shows a Gaussian proﬁle.
Generally, mirrors of circular size are used and
the active medium also has a circular cross section.
Because of this cylindrical symmetry, cylinder coordi-
nates (r, ϕ, z) are better suited for the description of the

modes are then described by the radial ﬁeld amplitude
distribution
E(r, ϕ, z) = E0e−(r/w)2 ,
where w is the beam waist, i.e. for r = w the amplitude
has decreased to E0/e. Because the intensity is related
to the electric ﬁeld amplitude by
I = cε0E2
we obtain the intensity distribution of the fundamental
modes
I(r, z) = I0e−2(r/w(z))2

sity has dropped to I(w) = I(0)/e2 can depend on the

Resonators with plane mirrors are often not the best
choice for two reasons. They have large diffraction
losses and they are very critical regarding alignment.
A tilt by an angle ε changes the direction of the reﬂect-
ed beam by 2ε, and the reﬂected beam might not pass
back through the active medium (Fig. 8.21a).

Spherical mirrors are less critical with respect to
alignment, as is shown in Fig. 8.21b for the example
of a confocal resonator, where the mirrors with radius
of curvature r are separated by the distance d = r. The
focal points of both mirrors coincide.
Resonators with spherical mirrors have lower
diffraction losses, because they refocus the divergent
diffracted beam and therefore decrease the beam spot
size on the mirrors, if their radius of curvature r and
their distance d is chosen properly.
In Fig. 8.19 the beam proﬁle for the fundamental
modes are shown for a confocal resonator with two
spherical mirrors with equal radii of curvature r and
mirror separation d = r. The smallest spot size appears
in the middle of the resonator at z = 0 when the mir-
rors are at z = ±d/2. In Fig. 8.22 the phase fronts of
the fundamental mode in a confocal resonator are il-
lustrated. At z = 0 in the middle of the resonator they
are plane, at the mirrors they coincide with the mirror
surfaces.
8.2.4 Diffraction Losses of Open Resonators
The diffraction losses of a standing wave inside a res-
onator depend on the radial intensity distribution I(r).

The larger the intensity at the edges of the mirrors or
of limiting apertures inside the resonator, the larger are
the diffraction losses. This implies, that the fundamen-
tal modes TEM00q have the lowest diffraction losses
while the higher transverse modes with n, m > 0 suf-
fer larger losses. In Fig. 8.23 the diffraction losses for
the fundamental and for some transverse modes are
plotted as a function of the Fresnel number NF for res-
onators with plane mirrors and for confocal resonators
with curved mirrors. This illustrates that for confocal
resonators diffraction losses are much lower. In fact,
a He-Ne-laser can only operate with curved mirrors,
because otherwise the diffraction losses would be too
high for the small gain achievable in a discharge with
only 10–15 cm length.
These diffraction losses offer the possibility to elim-
inate higher transverse modes and to achieve laser
oscillation solely on fundamental modes. The resonator
conﬁguration has to be chosen in such a way, that
the transverse modes suffer sufﬁciently high losses, to
prevent them from reaching the oscillation threshold.

with plane and with curved confocal mirrors, as a function

EXAMPLE
When the gain of the active medium per roundtrip
is 10% (G(ν) = 1.1 in (8.3)), the Fresnel number of
a confocal resonator has to be NF < 0.8, according to
Fig. 8.23, in order to prevent all transverse modes from
oscillation. For a wavelength λ = 600 nm and a mirror
separation d = 50 cm the limiting aperture must have
a diameter of 2a = 2(NFλd)1/2 < 10−4 m ≈1 mm.
8.2.5 The Frequency Spectrum
of Optical Resonators
For the fundamental modes with m = n = 0 a standing
wave can build up in a resonator with plane mirrors if
an integer multiple of the half-wavelength ﬁts between
the mirrors:
d = qλ/2 ⇒νr = qc/(2d) .
(8.24a)
The resonance frequencies νr of neighboring funda-
mental modes are separated by
δνr = νr(q) −νr(q −1) = c/(2d) .
(8.24b)
The spacing δνr is called the free spectral range of the
resonantor.
For the transverse modes TEMnmq the resonance
frequencies are obtained from the solutions of the inte-
gral equation (8.20), which can be solved analytically
for the confocal resonator [8.10]. One obtains
νr = c
2d

q + 1
2(m + n + 1)

,
(8.24c)
which converts to (8.24a) for m = n = 0, if q is re-
placed by q∗= q + 1
2. When m + n is an even integer,
the eigenfrequencies of the transverse modes are just
in the mid between two fundamental (also called lon-
gitudinal) modes, if m + n is odd, they coincide with a
frequency of a fundamental mode.
Standing TEMnmq waves with these eigenfrequen-
cies have minimum losses. They are stored inside the
resonator for a much longer time then waves with non-
resonant frequencies. The total losses can be described
by the sum
γ = γr + γsc + γdiffr
of the loss factors for reﬂection losses, scattering and
diffraction losses, where γdiffr sharply increases with m
and n.

Fig. 8.24. Net gain G(ν) for resonator modes within the
gain proﬁle of the active medium. The vertical black lines
give the frequencies of a multimode laser oscillating only on
fundamental modes TEM0,0,q
is only fulﬁlled for those resonance frequencies which
lie within the spectral gain proﬁle of the amplifying
transition of the active medium (Fig. 8.24). The laser
emission consists of all these frequencies and the total
bandwidth of the laser emission depends on the width
of the gain proﬁle above the threshold line −2αL = γ
in Fig. 8.24.
EXAMPLES
1. He-Ne Laser: d =50 cm⇒δνr =c/2d =300 MHz.
Within the gainproﬁle with ΔνD = 1.5 GHz are ﬁve
longitudinal modes. If the discharge tube diameter
is 2a < 1 mm, the diffraction losses are too high for
transverse modes and the laser oscillates solely on
these ﬁve fundamental modes.
2. Ruby laser: d = 10 cm ⇒δνr = 1.5 GHz. With
2a = 6 mm the diffraction losses are smaller than
the high gain even for higher transverse modes.
The width of the gain proﬁle is about 30 GHz. This
means that besides about 20 fundamental modes
many transverse modes are present in the emission
of the ruby laser.
8.3 Single Mode Lasers
In order to achieve laser oscillation on a single funda-
mental mode several measures can be taken.
The simplest one is the shortening of the res-
onator length d below a value where the mode spacing

302
8. Lasers
δνr = c/(2d) becomes larger than one-half of the spec-
tral width of the gain proﬁle at the threshold line. This,
however, generally reduces the gain for gas lasers and
only small output powers can be achieved. For solid
state lasers with a large gain per centimeter, this might
be a solution, but the spectral gain proﬁle of these lasers
is generally very broad and even short cavities still
might result in multimode operation.
The better, and most commonly used method for
achieving single mode operation is the insertion of ad-
ditional frequency selective optical elements into the
laser resonator. Such an element can be, for instance,
a tiltable plane parallel glass plate with reﬂecting sur-
faces on both sides (Fig. 8.25a), which represents
a Fabry-Perot etalon. As shown in textbooks on optics,
Fig. 8.25a–d. Selection of a single resonator mode (a)
Experimental setup (b) Resonator modes within the gain pro-
ﬁle of the active medium (c) Transmission T (ν) of the etalon
(d) Net gain of the laser with the etalon inside the resonator
the transmission of this etalon with reﬂectivity R on
both sides is given by
T =
1
1 + F · sin2(δ/2)
(8.25)
with
F =
4R
(1 −R)2 .
The phase shift δ = 2πΔs/λ between two adjacent
interfering partial beams with angles of incidence α
against the normal to the plate surfaces (Fig. 8.26) is
determined by the optical path difference
Δs = 2t
$
n2 −sin2 α .
(8.26)
From (8.25) it follows that T =1 for δ =2m · π.
This is fulﬁlled for all wavelengths λm = Δs/m
i.e. for all frequencies νm = c/λm = (c/Δs) · m, m =
1, 2, 3, . . ..
Adjusting the tilting angle α correctly, one of the
frequencies νm can coincide with a resonator eigenfre-
quency inside the gain proﬁle (Fig. 8.25c). Only for
this frequency are the total losses small, for all other
resonator eigenfrequencies the transmission of the
etalon is small and if the reﬂectivity R of the etalon
is sufﬁciently high the total losses for these frequencies
are larger than the gain and they do not reach oscilla-
tion threshold (Fig. 8.25d). The laser then oscillates on

a single fundamental mode if the transverse modes are
eliminated by high diffraction losses.
The mean line width of such a single mode laser
is mainly determined by technical ﬂuctuations of the
optical resonator length n · d, where n is the refrac-
tive index between the resonator mirrors. Since the
laser frequency is given by the eigenfrequency of the
resonator
νL = νr = q · c/(2nd)
ﬂuctuations Δn of the refractive index or Δd of the
resonator length result in corrsponding ﬂuctuations of
the laser frequency

(8.27)
EXAMPLES
1. If the mirror separation d = 50 cm changes by
1 nm, this results in a relative frequency change
Δν/ν = 2 × 10−9. At a laser frequency of ν = 5 ×
1014 s−1 we obtain ΔνL = 1 MHz!
2. If the air pressure between the mirrors changes by
1 mbar, this results in a change Δn/n = 2.5 × 10−7
of the refractive index, which means a frequency
shift of 125 MHz at ν = 5 × 1014 s−1
Such technical ﬂuctuations can be partly compen-
sated, if one of the resonator mirrors is mounted on
a piezocrystal (Fig. 8.27). This consists of a material,
that changes its length under an external voltage
applied to its end faces. If part of the laser output is

sent through a very stable Fabry-Perot (Fig. 8.28), the
transmitted intensity changes when the laser frequen-
cy changes. A photodiode D2 behind the FPI gives an
output voltage that reﬂects this intensity change. The
output is compared with a reference voltage provided
by the photo diode D1 and the difference is ampliﬁed
and applied to the piezocrystal, which changes the res-
onator length and brings the laser frequency back to
its wanted value. Such a feedback control system can
stabilize the laser frequency within about 1 Hz! New
very sophisticated devices can even reach a stability of
1 mHz = 10−3 Hz.
If all of these technical contributions to the frequen-
cy ﬂuctuations are eliminated, there is still a principle
physical limitation to the line width of the laser due to
the following effect.
The laser emission starts with avalanches of photons
induced by spontaneous emission. Since the sponta-
neousphotonsarerandomlyemitted,theamplitudesand
phases of these avalanches are random. The total laser
output consists of a superposition of such avalanches.

8. Lasers
Fig. 8.29. Spectral proﬁle of laser emission for an idealized
laser without technical perturbations, plotted on a logarithmic
scale
This results in amplitude- and phase ﬂuctuations of the
laser wave. The amplitude ﬂuctuations are compensated
by an inherent feedback mechanism of the active medi-
um: A positive peak in the amplitude reduces the
inversion and thus the ampliﬁcation, while a nega-
tive deviation from the average amplitude increases the
ampliﬁcation. Such a feedback mechanism does not
work for phase ﬂuctuations, which lead to a ﬁnite line
width (Sect. 7.4.3). A quantitative derivation gives the
famous Schawlow–Townes formula [8.2] for the lower
limit of the line width of a single mode laser:
ΔνL = πhνL
PL
· Δν2
r .
(8.28)
Here Δνr is the width of a resonator resonance for
an empty resonator, and PL is the output power of
the single mode laser. In Fig. 8.29 the resulting laser
proﬁle is plotted on a logarithmic scale, together with
the Doppler-broadened background of the spontaneous
emission.
This theoretical limit, which gives for PL = 1 W
and ΔνN = 1 MHz a line width of 10−6 Hz has nev-
er been realized in a practical experiment due to the
technical perturbations mentioned above. With normal
expenditure, a line width of about 100 kHz–1 MHz can
be achieved.
Note:
A laser width a line width ΔνL = 1 MHz has a coher-
ence length of Δsc = c/ΔνL = 300 m! However, for
a multimode argon laser with a bandwidth of 5 GHz the
coherence length is only Δνc = 6 cm, which is compa-
rable to that of a normal discharge lamp, where a single
emission line has been selected.
8.4 Different Types of Lasers
The different experimental realizations of lasers can be
divided into three main groups according to their active
medium:
•
Solid-state lasers
•
Liquid lasers
•
Gas lasers
Each of these types can be operated in a pulsed mode or
continuously (cw operation). Depending on the kind of
energy transfer from the pump into the active medium
we distinguish between optically pumped lasers (e.g.,
the ruby laser and other solid-state lasers, such as the
neodymium laser or the titanium-sapphire laser, and the
liquid-dye laser), and electrically pumped lasers (the
semiconductor laser and most gas lasers pumped by an
electric discharge).
Many types of lasers emit on ﬁxed frequen-
cies, corresponding to discrete transitions in atoms or
molecules. Their wavelengths can be changed only
slightly within a narrow gain proﬁle of the atomic
or molecular transition. We will call them “ﬁxed-
frequency lasers.”
For spectroscopic applications “tunable lasers” are
of particular importance, where the laser wavelength
can be tuned over a broader spectral range. These lasers
have a broad gain proﬁle and the laser wavelength can
be selected within this range by wavelength-selecting
optical elements (prism, optical grating or interferome-
ter) inside the laser resonator. Tuning the transmission
peak of these elements allows a continuous tuning
of the laser wavelength over the whole gain proﬁle.
Such single-mode tunable lasers represent an intense,
narrowband coherent wavelength-tunable light source,
which has proved to be of invaluable advantage for
numerous spectroscopic problems.
A completely different concept of tunable lasers
uses high energy relativistic electrons from an acceler-
ator as active medium. These electrons are forced onto
oscillatory paths in a periodically changing magnetic

ﬁeld, where the electrons emit radiation. With a
properly chosen period length of the alternating mag-
netic ﬁeld, the contributions of the radiation from the
different segments of the periodic structure superim-
pose in phase and add up to an intense wave in the for-
ward direction of the average electron path (Fig. 8.30).
The wavelength of the coherent emission depends on
the energy of the electrons and can extend from the
far infrared into the far ultraviolet. With high ener-
gy accelerators even the X-ray region can be reached.
Such lasers are called free-electron lasers because their
active medium consists of free electrons [8.11].
In the following sections we will discuss the most
commonly used laser types.
8.4.1 Solid-state Lasers
The active medium of solid-state lasers are cylindrical
rods of glass or single crystals, which are doped with
special atoms, ions or molecules that can be optically
pumped into excited states. The doping concentration
varies between 0.1% to about 3%, depending on the

solid-state lasers are compiled with their characteristic
data.
All these solid-state lasers are optically pumped.
Often pulsed ﬂashlamps are used as pump sources,
which results in a pulsed laser output. Although ruby
lasers were the ﬁrst lasers, these are being replaced
more and more by neodymium lasers, which consist of
a glass rod doped with Nd+++ ions emitting laser radi-
ation at λ = 1.06 μm. The advantage of the Nd lasers is
based on the fact that it represents a four-level system
(Fig. 8.31), which needs less inversion and therefore
less pump power than the three-level ruby laser. Its in-
frared emission can be converted by optical frequency
doubling (see Sect. 8.5) into the visible range.
The laser threshold can be further lowered by re-
placing the glass in the Nd-glass laser by a crystal of
yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG), which has a higher
heat conductivity and can therefore more effectively
transfer the excess energy N(hνp −hνL) (produced as
heat in the rod when N photons are emitted) to the
cooling system.

8. Lasers
Fig. 8.31. Level scheme of the Nd:glas laser
The pulse durations of these solid-state lasers range
from microseconds to milliseconds and the output
pulse energies from 1 mJ to about 1 J, which gives peak
powers from the kW range to many MW.
In order to achieve higher output powers, the output
of the laser oscillator is sent through an optical ampliﬁ-
er, consisting of one or several optically pumped rods,
where inversion is achieved (Fig. 8.32). These laser am-
pliﬁers have a similar setup as the laser oscillator, but
without the mirrors, to prevent self-starting laser os-
cillation in these stages. The oscillator and ampliﬁer
are separated by an optical isolator in order to prevent
feedback into the oscillator.

All lasers compiled in Table 8.1 can also be pumped
by continuous pump sources, e.g., with continuous
lasers. They then emit cw radiation with a wavelength λ
that can be tuned within the gain proﬁle of the active
medium. Some of these media have a very broad gain
proﬁle, such as the Ti:Al2O3 (titanium-sapphire) laser
(Fig. 8.33). The reason for this broad tuning range is
as follows. The optically pumped excited states relax
in a very short time into a lower level, due to interac-
tions with the vibrating atoms of the host crystal. This
level represents the upper laser level. The optical transi-
tions from this level (Fig. 8.34) can terminate on many
“vibronic levels” within a low-lying electronic state,
corresponding to vibrations of the host crystal Al2O3
(phonons). These phonons relax very fast into lower
levels, thus repopulating the initial state from which the
pump process starts.
Another important class of tunable solid-state lasers
are color-center lasers, which consist of alkali-halide
crystals (e.g., NaCl or KBr), which are transparent in

the visible. If defects (a missing negative halide ion)
are produced in such a crystal by X-ray irradiation, the
vacancy spot acts as a potential well for the remaining
electron (Fig. 8.35a). The energy levels of this elec-
tron can be excited by absorption of visible photons,
thus making the crystal appear colored. Therefore these
vacancies are called color centers.
When the electron is excited, the forces on the sur-
rounding ions change. This changes their arrangements
around the color center and the energy of the initially
excited states |1⟩decreases to level |k⟩. (Fig. 8.35b),
which acts as an upper laser level. Similarly to vibronic
lasers, the laser emission terminates on many vibronic
levels |i⟩which relax into the initial level |0⟩.
In Fig. 8.35c the tuning ranges of different color
center lasers are illustrated.
8.4.2 Semiconductor Lasers
The active medium of semiconductor lasers (often
called diode lasers) is a p-n semiconductor diode. An
electric current is sent in the forward direction through
the diode, which transports electrons from the n-into
the p-section and holes from the p- into the n-section.
At the n-p-junction the electrons and holes can recom-
bine (i.e., the electrons fall from an energetically higher
state in the conduction band into a lower hole state
in the valence band) and may emit their recombina-
tion energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation
(Fig. 8.36). The emitted radiation can be ampliﬁed
when passing along the p-n-junction (stimulated re-
combination). Since the electron density is very high,
the ampliﬁcation is correspondingly large and a path
length through the active medium of less than 1 mm is
sufﬁcient to reach laser threshold.
The uncoated polished or cleaved end faces of
the semiconductor crystal can serve as resonator mir-
rors. The refractive index of semiconductor materials

and conduction band and radiative recombination of electrons

is very large. For example for the GaAs (gallium-
arsenide) laser emitting at λ = 850 nm is n = 3.5. The
reﬂectivity for vertical incidence is
R =
n −1
n + 1
2
≈0.30 .
(8.29)
Because of the high gain, this reﬂection is sufﬁcient to
surpass the laser threshold in spite of reﬂection losses
of 0.7 per one-half roundtrip.
Typical output powers of cw semiconductor lasers
are 10–50 mW, when they are pumped by an elec-
tric current of 100–300 mA. Special arrays of many
simultaneously pumped diodes deliver output powers
of more than 100 W! The plug-in efﬁciency of radia-
tion output power to electric input power, deﬁned as
the ratio
η = Pout
L /Pin
el ≈0.25 ,
reaches 25–30%, which is the highest efﬁciency of all
lasers developed so far.
Diode lasers are more and more used for pumping
other solid state lasers. Using different semiconduc-
tor materials, wide tuning ranges for the diode laser
wavelengths can be achieved.
The wavelength range of diode laser emission cov-
ers the spectral region between the blue (400nm) to
the mid infrared (5μm), depending on the composition
of the semiconductor material. Because of this large
wavelength span and of their high energy efﬁciency
they replace more and more other optical pumping
sources. Meanwhile compact diode laser-pumped solid
state laser devices are available, which deliver output
powers in the multiwatt range.
8.4.3 Dye Lasers
The most important representatives of liquid lasers are
dye lasers with various designs, which can be operat-
ed in a pulsed as well as in a cw mode. The active
media are large dye molecules dissolved in a liquid
(e.g., ethylene glycol). These molecules have many
vibration-rotation levels in the electronic ground state
(singlet S0) and in excited states (Si or triplet states Ti).
The energy level scheme is schematically depicted in
Fig. 8.37. The strong interaction of the dye molecules
with the liquid solvent results in a broadening of the
transitions, which is larger than the average spacings

Instead of many discrete lines broad absorption and
emission bands appear (Fig. 8.37b).
The pump source (a ﬂashlamp or a pulsed or
cw laser) excites the dye molecules from the ground
state S0 into many vibration-rotation-levels of the S1
state. Due to the strong interaction with the sol-
vent, the excited molecules relax within a short time
(10−10–10−12 s) into the lowest levels |2⟩of the
S1 state, from where they emit ﬂuorescence on radia-
tive transitions into many vibration-rotation-levels |3⟩
of the S0 state. Since these levels with energies E >

population inversion can be reached between these lev-
els |2⟩and the levels |3⟩, if the former are sufﬁciently

starts from the lowest levels |2⟩in S1 and terminates
on the higher levels |3⟩in S0, the emission spectrum
is red-shifted towards longer wavelengths against the
absorption spectrum (Fig. 8.37b).
The dye laser can oscillate on those transitions
where the threshold is reached. From the broad emis-
sion line proﬁle a speciﬁc wavelength can be select-
ed by wavelength-selecting elements inside the laser
resonator. Tuning the transmission peaks of these el-
ements results in a corresponding tuning of the laser
wavelength. In Fig. 8.38 the tuning ranges for different
dyes are shown. This ﬁgure illustrates that with differ-
ent dyes the whole spectral range from 1 μm down to
about 400 nm can be covered.
In Fig. 8.39 the experimental design of a ﬂashlamp-
pumped dye laser is shown. It is similar to that of
the ruby laser in Fig. 8.10, but the solid rod is re-
placed by a glas tube through which the dye solution
is pumped, producing a steady ﬂow of dye molecules
through the region pumped by the ﬂashlamp. Because
of the broad gain proﬁle a prism is placed inside the
resonator in order to select the wanted wavelength.
Only that wavelength λ can oscillate, for which the
laser beam hits the end mirror M2 vertically. All other
wavelengths are reﬂected back under an angle inclined
against the resonator axis and do not reach the gain
medium again. Wavelength tuning is accomplished by
tilting the mirror M2.

In Fig. 8.40 the arrangement is shown for a dye
laser, pumped by another pulsed laser (e.g., a nitrogen-
laser or an excimer laser (see below)). The pump beam
is focused by a cylindrical lens into the dye cell,
forming a line focus where inversion is achieved. The
narrow dye laser beam is enlarged by telescope optics
and falls onto an optical Littrow grating, where the ﬁrst
order diffraction is reﬂected back into the incident di-
rection. This can be realized with a grating with groove
distance d, if the incidence angle α is equal to the
diffraction angle β, which gives the grating equation

The spectral resolution of the grating
λ/Δλ = m · N
(8.31)
is proportional to the number N of illuminated grooves
and the diffraction order m. Therefore it is necessary to
enlarge the dye laser beam to cover a large number of
grooves N. Tilting the grating results in a continuous
tuning of the laser wavelength.
Since the spectral width Δν of pulsed lasers with
pulse duration t is principally limited by the Fourier
limitation Δν = 1/Δt, cw lasers are demanded for re-
ally high resolution in the MHz range. In Fig. 8.41
a commercial version of such a single mode cw dye
laser is shown.
The active medium is a thin (≈0.5 mm) liquid jet
of the dye solution, which is pumped by an argon laser
beam, focused by a spherical mirror into the dye jet.
Differently from the previously discussed resonators,
four mirrors form a ring-resonator, where no standing
laser wave is produced but a wave running only in
one direction. This has the advantage that no nodes are
present as in a standing wave and the whole inversion
of the active medium can contribute to the laser ampli-
ﬁcation. In order to avoid laser waves in both directions
the losses for one direction must be higher than for the
other direction. This can be achieved with an optical
diode (unidirectional device), consisting of a birefrin-
gent crystal and a Faraday polarization rotator, which
turns the birefringent rotation back to the input po-
larization for the wave incident in one direction, but
increases the rotation for the other direction. Waves
with the wrong polarization suffer large losses at the
many Brewster surfaces in the resonator and therefore
do not reach the threshold.
Wavelength selection is achieved with a birefrin-
gent ﬁlter and two Fabry–Perot-etalons with different
thicknesses t. If the transmission peaks of all these el-
ements are tuned to the same wavelength λ, the laser
will oscillate at this wavelength as a single mode laser.
The laser wavelength can be continuously tuned, if
all elements and the resonator length are tuned syn-
chronously. This can be realized with special feedback
control systems. For details of these devices see [8.12].
8.4.4 Gas Lasers
Nearly all gas lasers use gas discharges as active medi-
um. Besides the He-Ne laser already discussed in
Sect. 8.1.2 the most important gas lasers are compiled
in Table 8.2. Here, we will only brieﬂy discuss the
physical principles of their operation.

The argon laser oscillates on transitions between
different excited levels of argon ions Ar+. It there-
fore needs a high current discharge (5–50 A with
70–700 A/cm2 current density), where the degree of
ionization is high. The excitation of the upper laser
levels occurs in two steps:
Ar + e−→Ar+ + 2e−
(8.32a)
Ar+ + e−→Ar+∗(4p, 4s) + e−.
(8.32b)
In a capillary of ceramic (length ≈1 m, diameter ≈
3 mm) current densities of more than 700 A/cm2 are
reached at a total discharge current of 50 A. The gas
discharge is conﬁned by a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
in order to prevent the ions to reach the wall of the
capillary where they could damage it by sputtering.
The ceramic tube is cooled by a water ﬂow between
the tube and an outer cylinder on which the electric
wires for the magnetic ﬁeld are wound. A heated helical
cathode supplies the large electron current necessary to
maintain the discharge (Fig. 8.42). An elegant techni-
cal solution for the transfer of heat (≈20–30 KW) to
the cooling water is shown in Fig. 8.42b. The discharge
runs through small holes (3 mm diameter) in tungsten
discs, which are heated by the dissipated power to tem-
peratures up to 1,000 K. These hot discs transfer their
energy through copper discs and by radiation to the

8. Lasers
Since several upper levels in the Ar+ ions are
excited, the laser can reach oscillation threshold for
several transitions and therefore oscillates on several
wavelengths. A speciﬁc wavelength can be selected by
a prism inside the resonator (Fig. 8.43). By tilting the
mirror M2 the desired wavelength can be chosen.
The efﬁciency of the argon laser
η = PL/Pelectr ≈0.1%
is very low. In order to produce 1 W laser output pow-
er, more than 10 kW electrical input power are neces-
sary. Most of the power (99.9%), put into the discharge,
is converted into heat transferred to the walls of the
dischargeandhastobetakenawaybythecoolingwater.
The CO2 laser has the highest efﬁciency of all gas
lasers (≈10 −20%) and for cw operation the highest
output power. The active medium is a gas discharge
in a mixture of He, N2 and CO2. By electron im-
pact in the discharge excited vibrational levels in the
electronic ground states of N2 and CO2 are populat-
ed (Fig. 8.44). The vibrational levels v = 1 in the N2
molecule and (ν1, ν2, ν3) = (0001) in the CO2 molecule
(see Sect. 10.4) are near-resonant and energy transfer
from the N2 molecule to the CO2 molecule becomes
very efﬁcient. This populates the (0001) level in CO2
preferentially, creates inversion between the (0001) and
the (0200) levels, and allows laser oscillations on many

Note:
The linear CO2 molecule has three normal modes of vi-
bration, labeled ν1, ν2 and ν3, and depicted in the upper
part of Fig. 8.44a (see also Sect. 10.3). The vibrational
state of the molecule is described by the number of
vibrational quanta in these modes. A state with 1 quan-
tum in ν1, 2 quanta in ν2 and 0 quanta in ν3 is labeled
as (120). The bending vibrational mode is twofold de-
generate and can have a vibrational angular momentum
along the CO2 axis. The number of quanta nh of this
vibrational angular momentum is stated as an upper in-
dex to the vibrational ν2 quanta. The upper laser level
(0001) has zero vibrational angular momentum and 1
vibrational quantum in the ν3 mode.
A powerful gas laser in the UV is the excimer
laser, where speciﬁc diatomic molecules, called ex-
cimers, form the active medium. These excimers

Fig. 8.45. Potential curves and ﬂuorescence transitions of an
excimer
(excited dimers), are stable in an electronically excit-
ed state but unstable in their ground state (Fig. 8.45).
Examples are the noble gas halides, such as XeCL,
KrCL or ArF. If the stable upper state AB∗of the ex-
cimer AB is populated, (e.g., by electron excitation of
the atom A and recombination A∗+ B →(AB∗), in-
version is automatically produced because the lower
state is always completely emptied by fast dissocia-
tion on a time scale of 10−13 s, if it is populated by
ﬂuorescence from the upper level.
Excimers are therefore ideal candidates for an ac-
tive laser medium. They have the additional advantage
that the emission from the bound upper level termi-
nates on a repulsive potential curve on the dissociative
ground state and therefore forms a broad emission con-
tinuum. This results in a broad gain proﬁle and the
wavelength of the excimer laser can be tuned over
a relatively large range.
8.5 Nonlinear Optics
The optical frequency of lasers can be doubled in
nonlinear optical crystals, thus considerably extending
the wavelength range where coherent radiation can be
generated. In this section we will brieﬂy discuss the
physical principles of optical frequency doubling or
mixing under the heading nonlinear optics.
When an optical wave passes through a crystal,
it induces the atomic electrons to forced oscillations.
For sufﬁciently small electric ﬁeld amplitudes E of the
wave the elongations of the oscillating electrons are
small and the restoring forces are proportional to the
elongation (linear range). The induced dipole moments
p = α · E are proportional to the ﬁeld amplitude and
the components Pi of the dielectric polarization of the
medium induced by the light wave
Pi = ε0
.
j
χi j E j
(i, j = x, y, z)
(8.33)
are linearly dependent on E, where χi j are the compo-
nents of the tensor χ of the electric susceptibility. This
is the realm of linear optics.
EXAMPLE
The ﬁeld amplitude of the sunlight reaching the earth
at λ = 500 nm within a bandwidth of 1 nm is about
E ≈3 V/m. On the other side the electric ﬁeld from
the Coulomb force, binding the electron to the nucleus
is, for a binding energy of 10 eV, about
EB = −
10 V
10−10 m = 1011 V/m .
(8.34)
Therefore, the elongation of the electrons induced by
the sunlight (for example, for the Rayleigh scattering)
is very small compared with its mean distance from
the nucleus and the restoring force within this small
elongation is linear to a good approximation.
For much larger light intensities, as can be realized
with focused beams of lasers, the nonlinear range of
electron elongations can be readily reached. Instead of
(8.33) the dielectric polarization has to be written as the
expansion

where χ(n) is the nth order susceptibility, which is rep-
resented by a tensor of rank (n + 1). The quantities χ(n)
decrease rapidly with increasing n. However, for sufﬁ-
ciently high ﬁeld amplitudes E the higher order terms
in (8.35) can be no longer neglected. They form the
basis of nonlinear optical phenomena.

passes through the medium, the frequency spectrum
of the induced polarization P also contains (because
of the higher powers n of the ﬁeld amplitudes En),
besides the fundamental frequency ω, higher harmon-
ics mω (m = 2, 3, 4 . . .). This implies: The induced
oscillating dipoles emit radiation not only on the fre-
quency ω (Rayleigh scattering), but also on higher
harmonics (Fig. 8.46). The amplitudes A(mω) of these
emitted waves depends on the magnitude of the coefﬁ-
cients χ(n) and in a nonlinear way on the amplitude E0
of the incident light wave.

tor

through an isotropic medium we obtain from (8.35), for

when we neglect all higher order terms χ(n) with
n > 2. Similar equations are obtained for the y- and
z-components. Using the relation cos2 x = 1

(8.38)
The dielectric polarization contains a constant term
1
2ε0χ(2)E2
0x, a linear term with frequency ω and the
nonlinear term with 2ω. This means that each of the
atoms hit by the incident wave radiates a scattered wave
that contains the frequency ω (Rayleigh scattering) and
a second harmonic wave with the frequency 2ω.
The amplitude of the second harmonic wave is
proportional to the square of the amplitude of the in-
cident wave. This means that the intensity I(2ω) is also
proportional to I 2(ω).
The microscopic second harmonic waves, emitted
by the different atoms, can only add up to a macro-
scopic wave if they are all in phase for all location in the
crystal. Since the phase velocity generally depends on
the frequency (dispersion), special crystals have to be
used in order to match the velocities of the fundamental
and the second harmonic wave.
8.5.2 Phase Matching
When a plane wave (8.36) passes through the crystal,
it generates in each plane z = z0 dipoles with oscilla-
tion phases that depend on the phase of the inducing
fundamental wave at z = z0. In a neighboring plane,
z = z0 + Δz, the same phase difference exists between
the incident wave and the induced dipoles.
The waves at frequency ω, radiated by the atoms
in the plane z = z0 reach the next plane z = z0 + Δz
after the same time interval as the incident wave. They
therefore superimpose the microscopic waves emitted
from atoms in that plane in phase and add up to twice
their individual amplitude.
This is, however, not true for the second har-
monic waves, because their phase velocity vph(2ω) =
c/n(2ω) differs from that of the incident wave
vph(ω) = c/n(ω) if the refractive index n(2ω) ̸= n(ω),
which is generally the case. The second harmonic wave
generated by atoms in the plane z = z0 therefore reach-
es the plane z = z0 + Δz with another time delay than
the incident wave and a phase difference arises between
the microscopic second harmonic waves generated in
the two planes. After a distance
Δz = (λ/2)/[n(ω) −n(2ω)]
(8.39)
the second harmonic wave generated in the plane
z = z0 arrives at the plane z + Δz with the opposite
phase as the second harmonic waves generated in this

Fig. 8.47. Phase shift of π between the two harmonic waves

plane and therefore the two contributions interferes
destructively (Fig. 8.47).
In summary: In isotropic homogeneous media
the second harmonic waves generated in the
different planes do not superimpose in phase.
Summed over the whole crystal all phase differ-
ences between 0 and 2π occur and the total wave
remains very small due to destructive interfer-
ence of the different microscopic contributions.
A solution to this dilemma is provided by uniaxi-
al birefringent crystals, where the incident light wave
is split into an ordinary wave for which the refrac-
tive index n = n0 does not depend on the direction,
and an extraordinary wave where n = ne(Θ) depends
on the angle Θ between the optical axis of the crystal
and the propagation direction (Fig. 8.48). At a certain
angle ΘP, called the phase matching angle, the ordi-
nary refractive index n0(ω) for the fundamental wave
at frequency ω equals the extraordinary index ne(2ω)
for the second harmonic wave. In this direction, phase
matching is possible for a selected frequency ω. The
condition for phase matching can be written as
ne(2ω) = n0(ω) ⇒vph(ω) = vph(2ω)
⇒k(2ω) = 2k(ω) .
(8.40)
If the angle Θ is changed, phase matching is achieved
for another frequency ω, i.e., another wavelength λ.
Therefore the phase matched wavelength can be tuned
Fig. 8.48. Phase matching between fundamental wave with
frequency ω and second harmonics with 2ω in birefringent
optical crystals
by tilting the crystal. All microscopic secondary waves
at 2ω emitted into the direction Θ from the dipoles
induced by the incident fundamental wave are in
phase with the fundamental wave along the whole
path through the crystal. Now a macroscopic second
harmonic wave can build up, traveling in the same
direction as the fundamental wave.
For instance, the red ruby laser emission at λ =
690 nm is partly converted into UV light at λ =
345 nm in a properly phase-matched KDP (potassium-
dihydrogen phosphate) crystal. With sufﬁciently large
nonlinear coefﬁcients χ(2) of the doubling crystal and
with pulsed incident lasers of high peak powers conver-
sion efﬁciencies up to η = P(2ω)/P(ω) = 40% can be
achieved.
With cw lasers the output power is much less
and therefore the conversion efﬁciency η = χ(2)I(ω) is
smaller. One can either focus the laser beam onto the
crystal to increase I(ω) at a given power P(ω), or the
doubling crystal is placed inside an enhancement res-
onator with highly reﬂecting mirrors (Fig. 8.49), where
the power of the fundamental wave is enhanced by
a factor up to 100. With this technique a UV power of
more than 50 mW can be achieved for an input power
of 500 mW.

When two light waves

Besides the second harmonics at frequencies 2ω1
and 2ω2 also waves are generated with the sum fre-
quency ω1 + ω2 and the difference frequency ω1 −ω2,
if the phase matching condition can be properly chosen
for each of these different contributions. For exam-
ple, the phase-matching condition for the macroscopic
generation of the sum frequency ω3 = ω1 + ω2 is
k(ω1 + ω2) = k1(ω1) + k2(ω2) ⇒
(8.42a)
n2ω3 = n1ω1 + n2ω2
with
ni = n(ωi) .
(8.42b)
This condition is generally more readily fulﬁlled than
that for the second harmonic generation, because the
directions of the two incident waves (and therefore their
wave vectors) can be freely chosen within certain lim-
its, which imposes less restrictions to the selection of
the nonlinear crystal.
The possibility of optical frequency mixing has
greatly increased the spectral ranges covered by in-
tense coherent light sources. With difference-frequency
generation, using two visible lasers, the mid-infrared
region can be covered, while sum-frequency generation
gives access to the UV range down to λ = 200 nm. The
spectral limitations are given by the spectral regions
where the absorption of the nonlinear crystal becomes
large. For more information see [8.13–14].
8.6 Generation of Short Laser Pulses
The investigation of fast processes induced by the ab-
sorption of photons, demand a high time resolution of
the detection technique. Examples for such fast pro-
cesses are the decay of excited states with a short
lifetime, the dissociation of molecules or the rearrange-
ment of molecular structure after excitation into higher
energy states. This latter process plays an important
role in the visual process, where the primarily excited
rhodopsin molecules in the retina of the eye under-
go many energy transfer process before the excitation
energy is transferred into an electrical signal reach-
ing our brain. Such processes could only be studied
in detail after the development of ultrashort laser puls-
es with pulse widths down to about ﬁve femtoseconds
(1 fs = 10−15 s).
In this section we will brieﬂy discuss some exper-
imental techniques for the generation of short laser
pulses.
8.6.1 Q-Switched Lasers
The inversion threshold for obtaining laser oscillation
depends on the total losses (see Sect. 8.1.1), which can

8.6. Generation of Short Laser Pulses
317
be expressed by the quality factor (Q-factor) of the
laser resonator.
The Q-value of the kth resonator mode is deﬁned
as
Qk = −2πνWk
dWk/dt = + ω
γk
TR
(8.43)
and can be expressed by the total loss factor γk of this
mode and the roundtrip time TR = 2d/c.
The Q-switching technique uses the following
trick: During the pump process the Q-value of the laser
resonator is kept so low (i.e., the losses are so high)
that the laser threshold is not reached in spite of the
growing inversion. At a selected time t = ts, Q is sud-
denly switched to a maximum value (Fig. 8.50). This
prevents laser oscillation for t < ts and allows the pop-
ulation inversion to reach a large value, because it is
not depleted by induced emission. When the losses are
suddenly switched to a minimum value at t = ts the in-
version is way above threshold and the ampliﬁcation of
the spontaneous emission starting the photon avalanche
is accordingly high. This leads to a fast rising “giant
pulse”, which depletes the inversion within a short time
and therefore terminates itself.
In Fig. 8.51 two possible experimental realizations
of Q-switched lasers are shown. A fast spinning res-
onator mirror spoils the Q-value for all times, except
for the short time span where the mirror surface is
perpendicular to the resonator axis. The light from
a light-emitting diode LED is reﬂected by the backside
of the spinning mirror onto a photodetector. Its output
signal triggers the discharge of the ﬂashlamp, pumping
the laser. An electronic delay of the trigger signal can

With a rotating resonator mirror (b) With an electro-optic
switch (Pockels cell) inside the laser resonator
select the time delay between trigger time and vertical
position of the spinning mirror.
The optimum time delay depends on the duration
of the pump pulse and on the lifetime τ of the upper
laser level. The time delay must be smaller than the life-
time τ, because otherwise one looses too much of the
upper state population necessary for the ampliﬁcation
of the giant pulse.
Another more commonly employed technique us-
es a Pockels cell inside the laser resonator for
Q-switching. A Pockels cell consists of a birefringent
crystal that changes its birefringence with an applied
electric ﬁeld. If the crystal is biased in such a way that
it rotates the plane of polarization by 45◦for one tran-
sit, the light transmitting the crystal a second time after
reﬂection by mirror M2 has its plane of polarization
turned by 90◦. A polarization beam splitter then reﬂects
the beam out of the laser resonator (Fig. 8.51b). At the
Q-switching time ts, a high voltage pulse is suddenly
applied to the crystal that changes the birefringence and
brings the rotation angle per transit to 90◦and for the
reﬂected beam to 180◦. The beam is now transmitted
by the polarization beam splitter and reaches the laser
rod.

These techniques generate giant laser pulses with
durations of a few ns and peak powers of 105–109 W,
depending on the laser type.
8.6.2 Mode-Locking of Lasers
Much shorter pulses can be achieved with the mode-
locking technique, which is based on the following
principle.
If a light wave with frequency ω0 = 2πν0 and
intensity
I = I0cos2ω0t
passes through an optical modulator with modulation
frequency f = Ω/2π and transmission
T = T0(1 −a · sin2(Ωt/2))
(8.44)
the transmitted intensity is
It = I · T = I0T 0[1 −a · sin2(Ω/2)t] · cos2 ω0t.
(8.45)
The degree of modulation a < 1 depends on the volt-
age applied to the modulation cell. The Fourier analysis
of such a modulated light wave gives a frequency
spectrum that consists of the carrier frequency ν0 and
sidebands at frequencies ν0 ± n · f (n = 1, 2, 3 . . .)
Inserting the modulator inside the laser resonator
(Fig. 8.52) and choosing the modulation frequen-
cy f = Ω/2π to be equal to the frequency separation
Δν = c/2d = f
of the longitudinal resonator modes, makes all side-
bands resonant with resonator modes. This means that
the sidebands can participate in laser oscillation as long
as their frequencies lie within the gain proﬁle of the ac-
tive medium. This leads to a coupling of all resonator
modes within the gain proﬁle because the phases of the
sidebands are coupled to that of the carrier by the phase
of the modulation.
The amplitude of the kth mode becomes

Fig. 8.53. Mode-locked pulses, where N modes have been
locked. Note the different ordinate scales
The peak power of the pulses is proportional to N 2.
The pulse energy is proportional to N 2ΔT ∝N. In
between two succesive main pulses (N −2) small max-
ima appear, which decrease in intensity as N increases
(Fig. 8.53).
Contrary to a normal multimode laser that can os-
cillate simultaneously on many modes with, however,
random phases, the mode-locked laser oscillates on
many phase-coupled modes, because the modulator en-
forces a deﬁnite phase relation between the oscillating
modes.
EXAMPLES
1. The gain proﬁle of the He-Ne laser has a width
of about δν = 2 GHz. Mode-locking therefore
achieves pulses with a minimum duration of Δτ =
500 ps.
2. The argon laser has a larger spectral width δν =
6 GHz of its gain proﬁle and allows mode-locked
pulses with widths down to Δτ = 170 ps.
3. The dye laser has a very large spectral band-
width of about δν = 3 × 1013 s−1. Therefore, puls-
es down to Δτ = 3 × 10−14 s should be possible.
The experimental realization only reaches Δτ =
3 × 10−12 s = 3 ps. This corresponds to the transit
time Δt = Δx/c of the light through the modulator
with length Δx.

locked Nd:glass laser (W. Rudolf, F.B. Physik, Univ.

Not only cw lasers, but also pulsed lasers, can
be mode-locked. The pulse amplitude is no longer
constant but follows the time proﬁle of the gain. In
Fig. 8.54 the pulse sequence within the envelope of a
single pulse of a mode-locked neodymium-glass laser
is shown for illustration.
The shortest laser pulses, obtained so far are gen-
erated by a nonlinear effect, called Kerr lens mode-
locking. Its basic principle is illustrated in Fig. 8.55.
For sufﬁciently high intensities, the refractive index
is affected by the nonlinear interaction of the light wave
with the medium. It can be written as a sum
n(ω, I) = n0(ω) + n2(ω) · I
(8.51)
where n0(ω) is the normal refractive index and
n2(ω) ≪n0(ω) is the nonlinear part of n. The intensity-
dependent change of the refractive index is caused by
the nonlinear polarization of the atomic electron shells
induced by the electric ﬁeld of the optical wave and is
therefore called the optical Kerr effect.
When a laser beam with a Gaussian radial intensity
proﬁle I(r) passes through a medium, the refractive in-
dex shows a radial gradient with a maximum value of n
at the central axis at r = 0. The medium then acts like
a lens and leads to a focusing of the incident laser beam,
where the focal length depends on the laser intensity.
When a laser pulse with the time proﬁle I(t) pass-
es through the medium, the central part of the pulse
around its maximum generates the largest gradient
of n(r) and therefore the shortest focal length fmin

of the Kerr lens. If an aperture is placed at a dis-
tance fmin behind the Kerr lens, only that part of the
pulse I(t) around its maximum at t = t0 is fully trans-
mitted through the aperture. All other parts before and
after the maximum produce a longer focal length and
therefore have a larger spot size at the aperture and
only the central part of the radial beam proﬁle is trans-
mitted through the aperture. These parts of the pulse
therefore suffer larger losses and are attenuated. This
happens for every roundtrip inside the resonator and
leads to a shortening of the pulse duration.
EXAMPLE
For sapphire Al2O3 n2 = 3 × 10−16 cm2/W. For the
intensity I = 1014 W/cm2 the refractive index changes
by Δn = 3 × 10−2 n0 with n0 = 1.76. For a laser pulse
with a wavelength λ = 1 μm this leads to an additional
phase shift of the optical phase by Δϕ = (2π/λ)Δn =
2π × 300 · 1.76 after a pathlength of 1 cm through the
Kerr lens material, which results in a radius of cur-
vature R = 4 cm of the wavefront of the light wave.
For a Gaussian beam proﬁle with peak intensity I(0) =
1014 W/cm2 which would be a plane wave without
the Kerr lens, the focal length of the Kerr lens is then
f = 4 cm.
This Kerr lens mode-locking has been successful-
ly applied to the generation of ultrashort light pulses
from a Ti:sapphire laser, which has a very broad gain
proﬁle and is therefore well suited to allow such short
pulses. In Fig. 8.56 a possible experimental realization
is shown. The Kerr medium is the Ti:sapphire crystal,
which acts simultaneously as active laser medium, and
the limiting aperture is placed in front of mirror M4.
The Kerr lens changes the focal length and therefore the
imaging characteristics of the laser resonator in such
a way that for the maximum of the laser pulse the focus
lies in the center of the aperture.
With such a device, pulses down to 4 fs have been
achieved. For these short pulses the spectral width is

Fig. 8.57. Schematic representation of an ultrashort light
pulse containing only three optical cycles of the light intensi-
ty. The envelope has a half-width of Δτ = 6 fs and a spatial
extension Δz = c × Δτ ≈2 μm
very large and any dispersion effects in the laser res-
onator must be carefully compensated for. For instance,
the dielectric mirrors with many reﬂecting layers gen-
erally have a wavelength- dependent phase shift, which
would lead to a broadening of the pulse. Therefore
special dispersion-compensated mirrors have been de-
signed that avoid this problem [8.15].
For an optical wave at λ = 600 nm (ν = 5 ×
1014 s−1), the optical cycle time is Topt = 1/ν = 2 fs.
A light pulse of 6 fs half-width therefore contains only
three optical cycles (Fig. 8.57).
8.6.3 Optical Pulse Compression
When a short optical pulse is sent through an opti-
cal ﬁber with a core diameter of 5 μm, the intensity
becomes so high that the refractive index
n(ω) = n0(ω) + n2 × I(t)
is changed by the nonlinear interaction of the medium
with the laser pulse. It becomes time-dependent. The
nonlinear term n2 can be positive as well as negative,
depending on the material and the laser wavelength.
A short pulse of duration ΔT can be described by
the wave packet
I(t) =
+Δω/2

−Δω/2
I(ω)ei(ωt−kz) dω .
(8.52)
This represents a superposition of many frequen-
cy components within the frequency interval δν =
1/Δτ = Δω/2π where I(ω) gives the envelope of the
spectral proﬁle.
The linear part n0(ω) of the refractive index causes,
for normal dispersion (dn0/dλ), a larger phase veloc-
ity for the red components in the pulse than for the
blue components. The red components will therefore
be at the leading edge and the blue components at the
trailing edge of the pulse. This results in spatial- and
time-broadening of the pulse.
The nonlinear part n2I(t) causes a frequency shift
dependent on the intensity. This can be seen as follows.
The phase of the wave E = E0 cos(ω0t −kz)
ϕ = ω0t −kz = ω0t −ωnz/c
(8.53)
= ω0 · (t −n0z/c) −A · I(t) ;
A = n2ωz/c
depends on I(t). Since the frequency
ω = dϕ/dt = ω0 −A · dI/dt
(8.54)
is the time derivative of the phase ϕ, it is evident
from (8.53) that with A > 0 the frequency at the lead-
ing edge of the pulse (dI/dt > 0) is decreased and
at the trailing edge (dI/dt < 0) is increased. This
phenomenon is called a chirp of the optical pulse,
where the optical frequency changes from small to high
frequencies over the pulse proﬁle I(t) (Fig. 8.58).
In summary, when passing through an optical
medium the optical pulse I(t) becomes broader,
caused by the dispersion n0(ω), and its spectral
proﬁle I(ω) becomes broader due to the chirp
induced by the nonlinear part n2 · I(t) of the
refractive index.
When such a spectrally broadened pulse is sent
through a pair of parallel optical gratings (Fig. 8.59),
the red components of the pulse are diffracted into an-
other angle β than the blue ones. From Fig. 8.59 one
can infer the path difference S between the plane phase
front of the incident wave at point A and the phase
plane at point B as
S = S1 + S2 =

(8.57)
This shows that the optical path length through the
grating pair increases with increasing wavelength.
Choosing the grating separation D sufﬁciently large,
the broadening of the pulse due to the linear disper-
sion in the optical ﬁber can be overcompensated for
by the grating pair and leads to a shortening of the
duration ΔT of the pulse I(t). The experimental ar-
rangement for the compression of optical pulses after
they pass through the ﬁber is shown in Fig. 8.60.
8.6.4 Measurements of Ultrashort Optical Pulses
Since the time resolution even for fast optical detec-
tors is limited to about 100 ps (except for the streak
camera, which reaches 1 ps) the measurement of such
short pulses can no longer be performed with conven-
tional devices, but demands new ideas. One method is
based on optical interferometry (Fig. 8.61). The laser
beam is split into two parts that are recombined after
having traveled along two different paths with slight-
ly different path lengths. The superposition of the two
parts with variable time delay τ and intensities I1(t) =
|A1(t)|2 and I2(t + τ) = |A2(t + τ)|2 gives the total
intensity
I(τ) = |A1(t) + A2(t + τ)|2
(8.58)
= I1(t) + I2(t) + 2A1(t) · A2(t + τ) ,
which depends on the relative phase between the two
optical waves, i.e., on the time delay τ. Although the
detector cannot follow the fast optical waves, it mea-
sures the time dependent interference pattern I(τ), if
the change of the time delay τ is sufﬁciently slow. If
the spectral width of the short pulse is large, it contains
a superposition of many monochromatic carrier waves
with a nearly continuous frequency spectrum. In this
case there will be no clear interference pattern and the

pulse proﬁle I(t).
In Fig. 8.62 an actual experimental result is shown
for a pulse with 7.5 fs duration (half-width at half-
maximum), which shows the optical cycles with 2.5 fs
period, monitored with a detector with a time constant
of about 1 ns.
Some applications of these ultrashort pulses are
discussed in Chap. 12.

•
A laser consists essentially of three components:
The energy pump, which produces inversion in
a medium by selective energy transfer into the
medium.
The active medium with a population inversion
for selected transitions where an electromagnetic
wave passing through the active medium is ampli-
ﬁed instead of attenuated.
The optical resonator, which stores the radiation
power emitted by the active medium in a few
resonator modes. In these modes, the number of
photons should be large. This ensures that in these
modes the induced emission is much stronger than
the spontaneous emission.
•
Laser oscillation starts at a threshold power deliv-
ered by the pump into the active medium, which
depends on the critical inversion and the total loss-
es of the lasing modes. At threshold the losses
are just compensated by the gain of the active
medium.
•
The oscillation frequencies of the laser emission
are limited by the spectral range where the ac-
tive medium has sufﬁcient gain. Within the gain
proﬁle of the active medium the lasing frequen-
cies are determined by the eigenresonances of the
optical resonator.
•
The divergence of the emitted laser beam depends
on the number of transverse modes participating
in laser oscillation. If only fundamental modes
contribute to laser emission, the laser beam proﬁle
is Gaussian and its divergence is only limited by
diffraction effects.
•
Single mode lasers, oscillating on a single funda-
mental mode, can be realized by additional mode
selecting elements inside the laser resonator.
•
A synchronous tuning of all frequency-selecting
elements allows the realization of a single mode
laser with a single wavelength tunable across the
spectral gain proﬁle of the active medium.
•
The active medium can be a solid, a liquid or
a gas. Broad gain proﬁles are provided by semi-
conductor materials, by dye solutions, by doped
crystals with color centers and by vibronic solid
state lasers consisting of an insulator, doped by
metal ions.
•
For some types of lasers, threshold inversion can
only be achieved with pulsed pumps (e.g., pulsed
Nd:glass lasers or excimer lasers), while most
lasers can be operated in a continuous wave mode
(cw lasers) as well as in a pulsed mode.
•
The time proﬁle of the laser output is limited by
the duration of the pump power above threshold.
•
By fast switching of the resonator quality factor,
short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be
realized (Q-switched lasers).
•
Coupling of many lasing resonator modes (mode
locking) results in even shorter pulses down to
about 1 picosecond.
•
By pulse compression in optical ﬁbers or by
nonlinear gain manipulation inside the laser cav-
ity (Kerr lens mode locking) femtosecond laser
pulses have been obtained.

9. Diatomic Molecules
In the next two chapters we will discuss the basic phy-
sics of molecules. In particular, the following questions
shall be addressed and answered:
•
Why can neutral atoms combine to form stable
molecules, i.e., what is the nature of molecular
binding forces?
•
What is the internal energy structure of molecules,
which not only depends on the distribution of elec-
trons in atoms, but also on the location and motion
of atomic nuclei?
•
How can chemical reactions, and therefore biologi-
cal processes, be explained on a molecular level?
First we will discuss diatomic molecules, because their
treatment is simpler than that of polyatomic molecules.
From the didactical point of view, they provide a good
understanding of many problems, which are relevant
not only to diatomics but also to polyatomic molecules.
In particular, the interaction between two neutral atoms
and its dependence on their distance R from each
other will give us better insight into the nature of
chemical bonds. Also, the model of molecular or-
bitals, which give an intuitive picture of the spatial
electron distribution and play an important role in
chemistry, can be explained more readily for diatomic
molecules.
Similarly to the situation for atoms, transitions be-
tween different molecular levels can be induced by
absorption or emission of radiation. Since the energy
levels of molecules are not only determined by elec-
tronic excitation but also by vibrations of the nuclei
or the rotation of the whole molecule around an ax-
is through its center of mass, the spectra of molecules
are much more complex than those of atoms, but on
the other hand they also give more detailed information
about the internal structure and dynamics of molecules.
We will discuss the spectra of diatomic molecules in
Sect. 9.6, while Chap. 10 deals with the structure, the
spectra and dynamics of polyatomic molecules.
We will start with the simpliﬁed model of rigid
molecules, where the nuclei are clamped at a given
position. For diatomic molecules this means that the
internuclear distance is ﬁxed and we neglect their vi-
bration. For any arbitrary, but constant, value of R the
energy of the molecule is calculated. This yields the po-
tential energy curves E(R) for the different electronic
states of the molecule. Later on we will then extend our
model to include molecular vibration and rotation.
Computer programs for calculating the potential
curves E(R) have developed rapidly and reach mean-
while, at least for diatomic molecules, the same accu-
racy as the experimental values.
9.1 The H+
2 Molecular Ion
The simplest of all molecules is the H+
2 ion, consist-
ing of two identical nuclei (protons) and one electron
(Fig. 9.1). The interaction potential Epot between the
three particles is

(9.1)
When we chose the center of mass of the two protons
as the origin of our coordinate system (because of its
small mass the electron does not noticeably change the
center of mass) we obtain from Fig. 9.1 the relations
r = RA + rA = RB + rB ⇒r = 1
2 (rA + rB)
because RA = −RB. With R = rA −rB we can re-
place rA and rB by:
rA = r + 1

rB = r −1

where the ﬁrst two terms represent the kinetic energy of

nuclei and the electron move in the potential Epot(r, R).
9.1.1 The Exact Solution
for the Rigid H+
2 Molecule
Differing from the situation for the H atom, the
Schrödinger equation (9.3) cannot be solved analytical-
ly. One must therefore use approximations. Because of
the much larger mass of the nuclei (M/m ≈1836) their
velocities v and their kinetic energy Ekin = p2/2M is
much smaller than that of the electron. In a ﬁrst approx-
imation we can neglect it. In this approximation the two
nuclei are clamped at a given distance R (rigid nuclear
frame). The nuclear distance R = |R| can be regarded
as a freely chosen parameter. This means that (9.3) is
solved for all relevant values of R. This gives the wave
function and the energy

plus the repulsive potential energy between the two nu-
clei for each chosen value of R, i.e., as a function of the
parameter R.

where rA and rB depend on the coordinates both of the
electron and of the two nuclei. The internuclear dis-
tance R must be treated as a ﬁxed parameter, not as
variable.
Equation (9.4) can be solved analytically in a sim-
ilar way as (5.1) for the H atom. Since the potential
energy is no longer spherically symmetric but has
cylindrical symmetry, it is convenient to use elliptical
coordinates:

(9.5)
where the location of the two nuclei are the focal points
of the ellipsoid with cylindric symmerty and the z-axis
as symmetry axis is chosen to coincide with the line
between the two nuclei (Fig. 9.2). In elliptical coordi-
nates the wave function, which is dependant on three
coordinates, is separable into the product
Φ(rA, rB, R) = M(μ) × N(ν) × φ(ϕ)
(9.6)
of three functions, where each function depends on on-
ly one coordinate. The ﬁrst factor M(μ) is constant for
μ = const., i.e. for rA + rB = constant. The value of
the constant depends on the quantum number associ-
ated with M(μ). This is fulﬁlled on the surface of an
ellipsoid with rotational symmetry around the z-axis
(Fig. 9.2b). The second factor N(ν) is constant for ν =
const., for instance for rA = rB. This is the symmetry
plane z = 0, perpendicular to the z-axis. The third fac-
tor is constant for ϕ = const. ⇒y = c · x, which gives
planes through the z-axis.
Similar to the separation of the hydrogen atomic
wave function, we obtain three equations for the func-
tions M(μ), N(ν) and φ(ϕ), which are analytically
solvable. Since the solutions have to be unambigu-
ous and normalized, this imposes restrictions on the
wave functions and leads to deﬁnite wave functions and
discrete energy eigenvalues En(R), which, however,
depend on the internuclear separation R (Fig. 9.3). The

The spatial part Φ(r, R) of the wave function

are called potential energy curves, although they also
include, besides the potential energy, the time-averaged
kinetic energy of the electron. They describe the poten-
tial in which the nuclei can vibrate, if we go beyond the
approximation of the clamped nuclei.
Since the potential is not spherically symmetric,
the angular momentum l of the electron is no longer
constant in time. In the classical model the vector l pre-
cesses around the internuclear axis. Its absolute value
|l| depends generally on the internuclear separation R.
In quantum mechanics its projection onto the z-axis has
for a stationary state a well-deﬁned eigen value

±l (Fig. 9.4) and is, for a given potential curve E(R)
independent of R. The reason for this is that the
operator
ˆlz = (¯h/i)∂/∂ϕ
(9.8b)
depends solely on ϕ and not on R. If it is applied to the
function (9.6) it acts only on the last factor φ(ϕ) and
yields the eigenvalue m · ¯h. This is completely analo-
gous to the case of the hydrogen atom in an external
magnetic ﬁeld, where the spherical symmetry is broken
and only cylindrical symmetry is left and the vector l
precesses around the ﬁeld axis.
The difference is, however, that in the axial electric
ﬁeld of a nonrotating diatomic molecule the energy of
a level does not depend on the direction of the ﬁeld.
This means, that levels with ⟨lz⟩= ±m · ¯h have the
same energy. Therefore the molecular levels are de-
scribed by the quantum number λ = |m|. Instead of
(9.8a) we write
⟨lz⟩= λ¯h .
(9.8c)
Analogous to the nomenclature in atoms, electrons in
diatomic molecules are called σ-electrons for λ = 0;
π-electrons for λ = 1 and δ-electrons for λ = 2 etc.
The Latin letters used in atoms are just replaced by
Greek letters for molecules.
Due to the precession of the electron around the in-
ternuclear axis for λ > 0 a magnetic ﬁeld in z-direction
is produced. If we take into account the electron spin s,
the magnetic moment μs can have two different orien-
tations in this ﬁeld, similar to the situation for atoms in
the Stern–Gerlach experiment (see Sect. 5.5). The elec-
tron spin precesses around the magnetic ﬁeld direction
(which is the z-direction) and only its z-component
⟨sz⟩= ms · ¯h = ± 1
2 ¯h
(9.8d)
has deﬁnite eigenvalues (Fig. 9.5).
The energy state E(R) of the electron in the
clamped nuclei model for a given nuclear dis-
tance R is completely deﬁned by the principal
quantum number n, the quantum number λ of
the z-projection of l and ms of s. This state
E(n, λ, ms) can therefore be characterized by the
three quantum numbers n, λ, ms.

Note:
In the literature the spin projection quantum number ms
is often labeled as σ. In order to avoid confusion with
the state with λ = 0, which is also called a σ-state, we
will use ms instead of σ in this book.
In Fig. 9.6 the spatial distribution of some molec-
ular orbitals are shown. They are characterized by the
three quantum numbers n, l and λ as nlλ, where n is
a number that labels the electronic states according to
increasing energy (analogous to the principal quantum
number n in atoms), l is the quantum number of the
orbital angular momentum l which is, however, only
deﬁned for large R, and λ the projection quantum num-
ber. As in atoms the states with different l-values for
R →∞are labeled with Latin letters (s for l = 0, p
for l = 1 . . .). A molecular orbital with n = 1, l = 0,
λ = 0 is named 1sσ and with n = 2, l = 1, λ = 1 is
a 2pπ orbital (see Table 9.1).

9.1.2 Molecular Orbitals
and LCAO Approximations
Although the rigid H+
2 molecule can be treated rig-
orously, it is instructive to apply some important ap-
proximation methods to the description of this simple
molecule and to compare the results with the exact
solutions. We can then learn more about the advan-
tages and deﬁciencies of these methods when they
are applied to larger molecules, that cannot be treated
exactly.
One of these methods is the LCAO approximation,
where the molecular wave function is composed of lin-
ear combinations of atomic orbitals of the atoms that
form the molecule. The coefﬁcients of the atomic or-
bitals in this linear combination are optimized in such
a way, that the energy, calculated with this molecular
wave function becomes a minimum. This optimiza-
tion procedure is based on the fact that the correct
wave function always yields lower energies than the
approximate functions [9.1].
Since the absolute square |Φ(x, y, z)|2 of the wave
function Φ represents the spatial probability densi-
ty distribution of the electron, which corresponds to
the classical orbitals of the electron in the molecule,
the molecular wave function is called a molecular
orbital.
The H+
2 molecular ion can be composed of an H
atom and an H+-ion (= proton) (Fig. 9.7). For the low-
est energy state of H+
2 , the H atom is in its 1s ground
state. The atomic orbital of the electron in the H atom
is then (see Table 5.2):
φA(rA) =
1

πa3
0
e−rA/a0 .
(9.9)
The electron can be found around either nucleus
A or B. Both possibilities lead to the H+
2 ion when the
two nuclei are brought to the proper distance R = Re.
Since we cannot distinguish between the two possibil-
ities we have to take both into account. We therefore
choose the molecular wave function as the linear com-
bination
Φ(r, R) = c1φA(rA) + c2φB(rB)
(9.10)
where rA = r + R/2 and rB = r −R/2 can be substi-
tuted by the nuclear separation R and the distance r =
|r| of the electron from the center of mass (Fig. 9.1).

The wave function should be normalized for arbi-

φAφBd3r != 1
(9.11)
where the integration is performed over the coordinates
of the electron.
Since the atomic orbitals are already normalized,
the ﬁrst two integrals have the value 1. From (9.11)
we obtain the condition for the coefﬁcients of the
normalized molecular wave function:
c2
1 + c2
2 + 2c1c2SAB = 1
(9.12)
where the integral
SAB =

φA(rA)φB(rB)dτ
(9.13)
depends on the spatial overlap of the two atomic wave
functions and is therefore called an overlap integral.
Its value depends on the internuclear separation R,
because the integration occurs over the electron co-
ordinates r = {x, y, z} which depend on R according
to (9.2).
Because of symmetry arguments, we have the con-
dition |c1|2 = |c2|2 = |c|2. Furthermore, the molecular
wave function has to be either symmetric or antisym-
metric with respect to the exchange of the two atomic
orbitals (which is equivalent to the exchange of the
electron between nucleus A and B). This demands
c1 = ±c2 and yields the normalized molecular wave
functions (Fig. 9.8):

represent two-center integrals, since the atomic orbitals
are expressed in coordinates with two different cen-
ters. When evaluating the integrals over the electron
coordinates dτel = r2 sin ϑ dr dϑ dϕ, the variables rA
and rB in the atomic orbitals have to be transformed
into a coordinate system with a common origin (see
Problem 9.1).
The curves Es(R) and Ea(R) are shown in Fig. 9.9.
They are called potential curves. While Es(R) has
a minimum and corresponds to a bound state, Ea(R)
is a monotonic function, falling with increasing R. It
represents a repulsive potential and corresponds to an
unstable molecular state.
It is interesting to investigate the reasons for the
binding of H+ + H in the ground state of H+
2 repre-
sented by the wavefunction Φs. The energy E(R) is
the sum of the kinetic energy of the electron and its
potential energy in the attractive force ﬁeld of the two
positively charged nuclei. In addition, the repulsive en-
ergy between the two nuclei has to be considered. In
Fig. 9.10, both contributions Ekin(R) and Epot(R) are
plotted together with the total energy E(R) in units of
the ionization energy EI(H) = 13.6 eV = 0.5 a.u. of
the hydrogen atom. The comparison between the re-

9. Diatomic Molecules
The LCAO approximation in its simplest form is
not in good agreement with the correct solutions. This
can be seen, for instance, from the fact that this approx-
imation gives for the limit R →0:
lim
R→0 E(R) →−3EA
(without the nuclear repulsion),
as can be seen from the calculation of the integrals
(9.17). Since for R →0 a nucleus with a charge Ze
with Z = 2 is formed, the energy should be −Z2EA =
−4EA.
Two different effects contribute to the binding:
a) The lowering of the potential energy at the equi-
librium distance Re, where the total energy E(R)
has its minimum. The electron charge distribution,
with its maximum in the middle between the two
nuclei (Fig. 9.8b), pulls the two nuclei towards each
other, due to the Coulomb force between electrons
and protons. It acts like a glue that keeps the nu-
clei together. This is the largest contribution to the
binding.
b) The molecular wave function Φs has a larger spatial
extension than the atomic 1s orbitals. The spatial
uncertainty for the electron is increased and its mo-
mentum uncertainty is therefore smaller than for the
H-atom, which means that its mean kinetic energy
⟨Ekin⟩=

p2
/2m is decreased.
Both effects contribute to the binding in the H+
2 ion.
However, their relative magnitude is not correctly de-
scribed by the LCAO approximation, as can be seen
from Fig. 9.10, where the different contributions to the
total energy are plotted in units of the ionization en-
ergy of the H-atom. In the LCAO-approximation the
main contribution to the binding energy comes from the
lowering of the kinetic energy, while the exact solution
shows that the binding is mainly due to the decrease of
the potential energy.
9.1.3 Improvements to the LCAO ansatz
The simple LCAO approximation can be essentially
improved if instead of the unperturbed atomic orbitals
(9.9) modiﬁed functions
φA = C(1 + λz)e−η(R)rA/a0
(9.18)
are used, where the two parameters λ and η(R) are
optimized for each nuclear separation R to bring the
energy E(R) to a minimum.
The parameter λ in the function (9.18) takes in-
to account, that the charge distribution of the electron
is no longer spherically symmetric in the force ﬁeld
of the two protons, but shows a deformation in the
z-direction, which reduces the spherical symmetry to
cylindrical symmetry. Furthermore, the radial distribu-
tions |Φ(rA)|2 and |Φ(rB)|2 will depend on the nuclear
separation, which is described by the parameter η(R).
For η > 1 the orbitals ΦA and ΦB are contracted, which
causes a lowering of the energy because the electron
charge becomes more concentrated between the two
nuclei.
The change of the kinetic energy due to the con-
traction of the atomic orbitals is due to two opposite
effects. The contraction of the orbitals gives the elec-
tron less space in the x- and y-directions. This leads to
an increase of the mean kinetic energy

E⊥

due to the uncertainty relation. However, the molec-
ular wave function becomes more expanded in the
z-direction, because the contraction parameter depends
on z. This decreases the kinetic energy

Ekin∥

2m ⟨vz⟩2 .
(9.19)
A detailed calculation of both effects shows that a small
net decrease of the kinetic energy is obtained for the
improved LCAO approximation, which is, however,
small compared to the decrease of the potential ener-
gy due to the contraction of the electron distribution
between the nuclei.
The physical reasons for the molecular binding can
be summarized as follows:
When the molecule is formed, the atomic orbitals
are deformed in such a way, that the decrease
of Epot(Re) at the equilibrium separation Re and
the decrease of Ekin(Re) overcompensates the
energy necessary for the contraction and de-
formation of the atomic orbitals. This gives an
energy minimum at R = Re below the energy of
the separated fragments H + H+.

9.2. The H2 Molecule
335
In Table 9.2 the different contributions to the energy
of H+
2 are compiled in units of Hartree = twice the ion-
ization energy of the H-atom (13.6 eV) for the different
approximations and for the exact solution.
The binding energy
EB(H+
2 ) = E(H, 1s) −E(H+
2 , 1σg, R = Re)
of the H+
2 ion can be described as the difference be-
tween the electronic energy of the atomic 1s state and
of the molecular H+
2 state at the equilibrium nuclear
distance R = Re. This binding energy amounts to only
about 1/5 of the binding energy of the electron in the
H atom.
Note:
The binding energy EB is here deﬁned as the energy
necessary to dissociate the molecule. It is positive! One
should not be mixed up with the absolute energy at the
potential minimum, which is negative!

The foregoing discussions have shown that even for
the simplest rigid molecule H2+ more reﬁned approxi-
mations have to be used in order to reach the accuracy
of the exact calculation. This is even truer for more
complex molecules. We will at ﬁrst present the approx-
imate treatment of the second simplest molecule H2
with two electrons.
9.2 The H2 Molecule
The H2 molecule consists of two protons as nuclei and
two electrons (Fig. 9.12). We therefore have to take into
account the interaction between the two electrons. This
has the consequence (similar to the situation in the He-
atom), that we can no longer separate the wave function
into a product of one-dimensional functions, as we
could for the H+
2 ion and no exact analytical solution
is possible, even for the approximation of the clamped
nuclei. We therefore have to use approximation pro-
cedures. Furthermore, because two electrons with the

same spatial wave functions are nondistinguishable the
Pauli principle has to be obeyed. This means that the to-
tal wave function has to be antisymmetric with respect
to an exchange of the two electrons.
We will here introduce the two most commonly
used approximations: The molecular orbital (MO) ap-
proximation and the valence method of Heitler and
London, because they provide good insight into the ap-
proximate calculation of electronic states of molecules
and their physical motivation. Although the two meth-
ods seem at ﬁrst to be quite different, they prove to be
equivalent in their improved versions.
9.2.1 Molecular Orbital Approximation
The ground state of the H2 molecule dissociates for
R →∞into two H atoms in the 1s state. We there-
fore choose, similarly to the H+
2 ion, the normalized
symmetric linear combination (9.14a)
Φs =
1
√2 + 2SAB
(φA + φB)
(9.20a)
of the two 1s atomic wave functions φA and φB, where
the electrons are labeled 1 and 2 and the nuclei A and B.
If both electrons are in the molecular ground state the
approximate total wave function
Φ(r1, r2) = Φs(r1) · Φs(r2)
(9.20b)
can be written as the product of the two molecular or-
bitals (9.20a). In this approximation the change of the
spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals due to the
mutual interaction between the two electrons has been
neglected.
The ansatz (9.20b) is symmetric with respect to an
exchange of the two electrons. Since the Pauli principle
demands an antisymmetric total wave function the spin
function must be antisymmetric. In this approximation
the total wave function, including the spin function, is
then
Φ(r1, r2, s1, s2) = Φs(r1) · Φs(r2) × 1

(9.21a)
We introduce the abbreviations
χ+ = α , χ−= β , φA(i) = a(i) , φB(i) = b(i) ,
where α(1) means: ms(1) = + 1
2, β(1) means ms(1) =
−1
2.
This gives the shorthand notation of the spatial part
(9.20b) as:
Φ(r1, r2) =
1
2 + 2SAB
[a(1) + b(1)]×[a(2) + b(2)]
(9.20c)
while the total wave function (9.21a) including the
electron spin can be written as the Slater determinant
Φ(r1, r2, s1, s2) =
****
Φs(1)α(1) Φs(2)α(2)
Φs(1)β(1) Φs(2)β(2)
**** (9.21b)
as can be immediately proved by evaluating the deter-
minant.
The total energy of the two electrons in the rigid H2
molecule is
E = Σ Ekin(i) + Epot .

9.2. The H2 Molecule
337
The ﬁrst two parts both represent the energy of the H+
2
ion, which has only one electron i = 1, 2. They have
already been discussed in the previous section. The
third term in (9.23) describes the Coulomb-repulsion
between the two electrons and the two protons. This
last term for the nuclear repulsion is subtracted here,
because it is already included twice in ˆH1 and ˆH2.
The energy E(R) of the ground state is given in
this approximation as twice the energy of the H+
2 ion
plus the energy of electron repulsion minus nuclear re-
pulsion. The corresponding potential curve E(R) has
a minimum at R = Re ≈0.7Å (Fig. 9.13). Here the
reference energy E = 0 is the energy of the fully sep-
arated particles e + e + p + p. The detailed calculation
shows that the two contributions of electron and nuclear
repulsion in the third term of (9.24) cancel for R = 1Å.
At the minimum position: R = Re(H2) they give on-
ly a small negative contribution to the total energy. In
this simple molecular orbital approximation the bind-
ing energy of the H2 molecule is slightly smaller than
twice the binding energy of the H+
2 ion in the LCAO
approximation. The binding energy of H2 becomes

the ionization energy of the separated H-atoms. This
approximation therefore has to be improved.
Note:
In the MO approximation the electron repulsion is in-
cluded in the Hamiltonian, but not in the molecular
orbital ansatz for the wave function!
Before we look for improvements of our approx-
imate wave function (9.21), we will discuss another
approximation method: the valence bond approxima-
tion, developed by Walter Heitler (1904–1981) and
Fritz London (1900–1954) which is therefore called the
Heitler–London approximation [9.4].
9.2.2 The Heitler–London Method
This method also starts with a molecular orbital ansatz.
The ground state molecular orbital with the lowest en-
ergy can be populated, according to the Pauli principle,
by two electrons with opposite spins. The correspond-
ing wave function
Φ1 = c1φA(1) · φB(2)
(9.25a)
gives the probability amplitude that electron 1 is at nu-
cleus A and can therefore be described by its atomic
orbital φA(1), while electron 2 is at nucleus B and is
described by the atomic wave function φB(2). However,
since the two electrons are undistinguishable,
Φ2 = c2φA(2) · φB(1)
(9.25b)
must be also a wave function, leading to the same
charge distribution.
According to the Pauli principle the spatial part of
the wave function must be either symmetric or antisym-
metric with respect to an electron exchange. Therefore
the total spatial part of the normalized wave function
can be written as the linear combination of (9.25a) and
(9.25b) with c1 = c = ±c2
Φs,a = Φ1 ± Φ2
(9.26a)
= c[φA(1)φB(2) ± φA(2)φB(1)] .
Since the atomic wave functions φA and φB are already
normalized, we obtain, analogous to the consideration
for (9.14), the coefﬁcient

9.2.3 Comparison Between
the Two Approximations
The difference between the molecular orbital approxi-
mation and the Heitler–London ansatz is the following.
In the former method a MO ansatz was made for one
electron, which can be found in the volume covered by
ΦA as well as by φB. The total wave function is there-
fore the linear combination (9.14a) of φA and φB. For
the occupation with two electrons the product ansatz
(9.21) for the two molecular orbitals is used which ne-
glects the mutual repulsion between the two electrons.
In the Heitler–London method both electrons are re-
garded from the beginning and the molecular orbital is
written as the product of the two atomic orbitals. The
ﬁnal wave function is the linear combination of the two
products.
More physical insight into this difference between
the wave functions (9.21) and (9.26) can be gained
if the multiplication of the two brackets in (9.20c) is
explicitly performed. This gives:
ΦMO
s
=
1
2 + 2SAB
(9.27)
× [a(1)a(2) + b(1)b(2) + a(1)b(2) + a(2)b(1)] .
By comparing with (9.26b) this explicit expression of
the MO ansatz illustrates that in the Heitler–London
ansatz (9.26b) the ﬁrst two terms are missing. They
describe the situation where both electrons are simul-
taneously at nucleus A or nucleus B, respectively, i.e.,
where the ion H+H−is formed. In the molecular orbital
ansatz this conﬁguration has the same weight as the
much more likely conﬁgurations a(1)b(2) or a(2)b(1)
(Fig. 9.14). It is therefore overestimated, while the ion-
ic form is completely neglected in the Heitler–London
ansatz.
In order to compare the molecular binding ener-
gy obtained from the two methods we rearrange the

(9.28a)
Here the division into the different contributions dif-
fers from those in (9.24), because ˆH is written as the
sum of the atomic Hamiltonians
ˆHA and
ˆHB of the
two H-atoms and a third term HAB, which contains the
attraction of electron 2 by nucleus A and electron 1
by B and the mutual repulsion between the electrons
and between the nuclei.
Inserting this Hamiltonian into the Schrödinger
equation
HΦ = EΦ
of the rigid H2 molecule yields the total energy
E = E(A) + E(B) + ΔEB
(9.28b)
where the ﬁrst two terms give the energies of the two
separated atoms A and B and the third term the dif-
ference E(H2) −2E(H). A stable molecule is formed
only if the energy ΔEB of the third term is negative,
which means that the total energy of the molecular state
is lower than the sum of the ground state energies of
the separated atoms. For ΔEB > 0 the potential curve
becomes repulsive. For R →∞the binding energy
ΔEB(R) →0.

tion (9.26) into the Hamiltonian (9.28a) the energy

can be calculated and gives the binding energy
ΔE(R = Re) = −3.14 eV ,
(9.29b)
which is already closer to the experimental value EB =
−4.7 eV than the result obtained with the simple MO-
LCAO approximation, where the ionic conﬁguration
was overemphasized.
9.2.4 Improvements to the Approximations
The real share of the ionic conﬁguration a(1)a(2) +
b(1)b(2) in the wave function (9.27) can be better
quantiﬁed if a variable parameter λ with 0 < λ < 1 is
introduced, changing the wave function (9.27) into
Φs(r1, r1) = c3[a(1)b(2) + a(2)b(1)
+ λ[a(1)a(2) + b(1)b(2)]]
(9.30)
with the normalization constant c3. If λ is varied in such
a way, that for each internuclear distance R the total
energy becomes minimum, a binding energy of EB =
−4.02 eV is obtained, a remarkable improvement com-
pared with the simple MO-LCAO approximation.
Of course, the ionic contribution can be also in-
troduced with the weight factor λ in an improved
Heitler–London version. This gives, instead of (9.26),
the same wave function (9.30) as for the improved
MO approximation, which means that at this state of
improvement, both methods are identical.
The results for the potential curve and the bind-
ing energy are still away from the experimental values,
which implies that further improvements are neces-
sary. Up to now we have used linear combinations
of undistorted atomic 1s wave functions with spheri-
cal symmetry. However, when the two atoms approach
each other, the electron charge distribution will be dis-
torted due to the interaction between the two electrons
and between an electron and the nucleus of the other
atom. It will no longer be spherically symmetric but
is deformed and also contracted. In order to take this
deformation into account, we compose the molecular
orbital (9.14a) not only of two 1s atomic orbitals, but
also of many atomic orbitals including nonspherical
ones, and write:
Φ(ri) =
N
.
k=1
ckφk .
(9.31)
In this sum, all atomic orbitals are included that can
best reproduce the contraction and deformation of
the 1s atomic orbitals. The molecular orbital for two
electrons can now be written either as the product
Φ(r1, r2) = φ(r1)φ(r2)
(9.32a)
(MO-LCAO approximation), or as the sum of products
of atomic orbitals
Φ(r1, r2) =
.
i,k
cikΦi(1)Φk(2)
(9.32b)
(Heitler–London approximation).
In both cases the coefﬁcients ci, which give the rel-
ative contributions of the atomic orbitals to the total
molecular wavefunction, are optimized in such a way
that the total energy E(R) becomes a minimum for
each selected internuclear distance R. This can be
achieved by solving the equation
∂
∂ci
( 
Φ∗ˆHΦ dτ
)
= 0
(9.33)
which gives for N coefﬁcients ci also N equations.
Here the energy E(ci) is regarded as a function of the
coefﬁcients ci, since the nuclear separation R is ﬁxed
to a selected constant value.
Calculations including 13 functions φi gave a bind-
ing energy EB(Re) = −4.69 eV at the minimum of the
potential curve, which already approaches the experi-
mental value very closely.
The most accurate calculations to date were per-
formed by Kolos et al. [9.5, 6], who used 50 functions
in the expansion (9.31) resulting in a binding energy of
EB = −4.7467 eV, which agrees with the experimen-
tal result within the error bars of the experimental value
Eexp
B
= −4.7470 ± 0.0003 eV.
The results of the different steps in the approxima-
tion calculations are illustrated in Fig. 9.15.
The discussion in this section has illustrated that
even for the simplest neutral molecule H2, accurate
calculations are tedious and demand large computers.
The improvements of the simple approximations were
guided by physical reasoning and also the selection of
proper basis functions in the expansion (9.31) using
physical intuition can reduce the number of functions
considerably.

9.3 Electronic States
of Diatomic Molecules
Up to now we have only discussed the electronic
ground state of the two molecules H+
2 and H2 and
have obtained the potential energy curve E(R) by ap-
proximate calculation methods. A similar concept is
pursued for larger diatomic molecules with nuclear
charges ZAe, ZBe and N = (ZA + ZB) electrons. The
molecular wave function
Φ(r1, . . .rN, R) = Σcnφn
(9.34)
is always written as a linear combination of many basis
functions φn, which might be atomic orbitals with co-
ordinates centered at the corresponding nucleus A or B,
but can also be other functions, such as Gaussian func-
tions or Slater orbitals. They are chosen either by
physical intuition to optimize Φ with as few basis func-
tions as possible, or by computational reasoning aimed
at minimizing the computational expenditure.
All of these computations are based on the mod-
el of rigid molecules. Their results give the potential
energies Ek(R) for the different electronic states and
their minimum values Ek(Rek), which are arranged in
a sequence according to increasing energy.
The different electronic states can be assigned by
several criteria:
a) By their energetic order
b) By the symmetry properties of their molecular wave
function
c) By the angular momenta of the atomic states form-
ing the molecular state and by the projection of
these angular momenta onto the internuclear axis
d) By the vector sum of their electron spins
e) By the atomic states into which they dissociate for
R →∞
Each of these criteria on its own does not al-
low the unambiguous characterization of a molecular
state. For instance there are several different electron-
ic states with the same projection Λ¯h of the orbital
angular momentum but different energies or different
spins. For a given conﬁguration of the two atoms form-
ing a molecule for decreasing internuclear distance R,
many different molecular states are possible.
9.3.1 The Energetic Order of Electronic States
The different electronic states Ei(R) of diatomics can
be characterized by the index i, which stands for the
various quantum numbers (principal quantum number,
angular momentum and spin quantum numbers). While
for atoms the principal quantum number n gives the
energetic order of the electronic states, this is not gen-
erally true for molecules. Only for higher Rydberg
states that dissociate into a ground state atom A and
a Rydberg atom B, does the energy monotonically in-
crease with increasing principal quantum number n
(Fig. 9.16). For lower states the energy difference be-
tween states with different angular momenta might
be larger than between states with different principal
quantum numbers. In this case it is no longer mean-
ingful to use the principal quantum number for the
characterization of electronic states.
The historical assignment of molecular electron-
ic states comes from spectroscopic experiments. The
ground state is always named the X-state, the next
highest state, accessible from the ground state by ab-
sorption of photons, is called the A-state, the next one
the B-state, etc. If the ground state is a singlet state,
only singlet states combine by absorption of radiation
with the ground state. The triplet states are named by
small Latin letters, a, b, c according to their energetic
order. Unfortunately, some new electronic states have
been discovered only after the assignment of the known

ic molecule
states. They are then labeled as A′, B′, ... states. This
nomenclature brings some confusion into the scheme,
but is still in use.
9.3.2 Symmetry Properties of Electronic States
Geometric operations, such as reﬂections of the molec-
ular electron cloud on a plane through the nuclei or at
the origin (chosen as the center of charge) and rota-
tions of the molecule around an axis through the origin,
are called symmetry operations if the nuclear frame
and the charge distribution are not changed by these
operations. This means that |Φ|2 is invariant against
symmetry operations.
We will describe the reﬂection at a plane through
the nuclei by the reﬂection operator σ. Since a dou-
ble reﬂection brings the molecule back into its original
state (Fig. 9.17a) we obtain for the wave function Φ the
relation
σ(σΦ) = σ 2Φ = +Φ ⇒σΦ = ±Φ .
(9.35a)
We deﬁne the symmetry of a wave function Φ as
positive, if
σΦ+ = +Φ+ .
(9.35b)
Fig. 9.17. (a) Reﬂection of all electron coordinates at a plane
through the two nuclei. (b) Inversion of all electron coordi-
nates at the origin
The wave function has negative symmetry if
σΦ−= −Φ−.
(9.35c)
The symmetry of a molecular state equals the symme-
try of its wave function. It is deﬁned by the symmetries
of the two atomic states that form the molecular state.
For homonuclear diatomic molecules with ZA =
ZB the inversion of all coordinates at the origin is an-
other symmetry operation which deﬁnes the parity of
a molecular state (Fig. 9.17b). We can write this as
I 2Φ(⃗r) = Φ(⃗r)
I(Φ(⃗r) = Φ(−⃗r) = ±Φ(⃗r)
(9.36)
We can distinguish between two classes of wave func-
tions. They are historically named by the German
words gerade (for even) and ungerade (for odd).
The gerade functions have even parity, i.e., I Φg(⃗r) =
+Φg(−⃗r) = Φg(⃗r),
while
for
ungerade
functions
I Φu(⃗r) = Φu(−⃗r) = −Φu(⃗r) the parity is odd.
Note this parity property is only present for diatomics
with equal nuclear charges.
9.3.3 Electronic Angular Momenta
Each electron in a molecule has an orbital angular mo-
mentum li and a spin si. Because the potential, in
which the electron moves has no spherical symme-
try, the orbital angular momentum is not constant in
time but precesses in a nonrotating molecule around the
symmetry axis of the molecule. For states with wave
functions of cylindrical symmetry, this is the space-
ﬁxed internuclear axis, which we choose as the z-axis.
We characterize the projection
lz = λ¯h
(9.37)

342
9. Diatomic Molecules
by the projection quantum number λ = |ml|.
We will at ﬁrst discuss molecules with only one
electron, such as H+
2 , or with one electron outside the
closed shell, such as Li+
2 (see Sect. 9.1.1).
The precessing electron produces a magnetic ﬁeld
in the z-direction. For molecules with small nuclear
charge numbers Z the interaction between the mag-
netic moments of li and si (l-s-coupling) is weaker
than the coupling of s to this magnetic ﬁeld in the
z-direction. In this case both li and si precess inde-
pendently around the internuclear axis. The projection
of s is called sz = σ ¯h, where σ is the spin projection
quantum number (Fig. 9.18). The molecular electronic
state is then characterized by the quantum numbers λ,
σ and s. The sum of the two projections is named
ω¯h = λ¯h + σ ¯h
For molecules with more than one electron the cou-
pling order of the different angular momenta depends
on the strength of the different interactions. Similar to
the situation in atoms (see Sect. 6.5) different coupling
schemes can be realized.
If the interaction between the different orbital an-
gular momenta li is larger than the coupling between li
and si (weak spin orbit coupling), than the total orbital
momentum

Electronic states with Λ = 0 are called Σ-states,
those with Λ = 1 are Π-states, with Λ = 2 are Δ-
states, etc.
Note:
Unfortunately the Greek letter Σ stands for states with
Λ = 0, but also for the projection number |MS|.
For large spin-orbit coupling, l and s form the
resultant angular momentum

mentum is

the projection
Jz = Ω · ¯h
(9.39b)
(Fig. 9.19b). In these cases the quantum numbers
λ, σ, Λ and Σ are not well deﬁned, but only Ω.
If the two atomic states into which the molecular
state dissociates for R →∞, have orbital angular mo-
menta LA and LB with projections (ML)A and (ML)B
onto the internuclear axis, the resultant projection Λ of
the molecular state can take the values
Λ = |MLA + MLB| .
(9.40)
Since (ML)A can take the (2LA + 1) values −LA ⩽
MLA ⩽+LA and (ML)B can also take 2LB + 1 val-
ues, the total possible number of molecular states with
different values of Λ, composed of two given atomic
states, can be quite large. Some examples are given in
Table 9.4.
EXAMPLE
The combination of an atomic P state with L = 1 and
a D-state with L = 2 results in 15 molecular states with
Λ = 0, 1, 2, 3. For (ML)A = −(ML)B there are three
Σ-states with Λ = 0. These form the combinations
| −(ML)A + (ML)B| = 0 ; | + (ML)A −(ML)B| = 0
and
(ML)A = (ML)B = 0 .
There are six combinations that lead to Λ = 1, four
combinations for Λ = 2 and two for Λ = 3.

9.3.4 Electron Spins, Multiplicity
and Fine Structure Splittings
Similar to the coupling of orbital angular momenta the
spins SA and SB of the atomic states A and B deﬁne the
spin
S = SA + SB
(9.41)
of the molecular state formed by combination of the
two atomic states as the vector sum of the atomic spins.
As for atoms, the multiplicity of a molecular state is
given by the number (2S + 1) of possible projections
Σ of S onto the internuclear axis.
For example, the two H atoms in their 12S1/2
ground state can form singlet molecular states of the
H2 molecule with a symmetric spatial wave function
and opposite spins or triplet states with an antisymmet-
ric spatial part and parallel spins of the two electrons.
In both cases the total wave function always has to
be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two
electrons.
Note:
This symmetry is deﬁned with respect to the exchange
of any two of the electrons and should not be confused
with the geometrical symmetry property with respect to
reﬂection at a plane through the nuclei. While the ex-
change symmetry is labeled “s” for symmetric and “a”
for antisymmetric, the reﬂection symmetry is labeled
as “+” for symmetric and “−” for antisymmetric.
The interaction energy of the electron spin with the
molecular magnetic ﬁeld B produced by the precessing
orbital angular momentum is proportional to the scalar
product
W ∝−S · B .
(9.42a)
Since B is proportional to the projection Λ¯h, the spin-
orbit interaction energy can be written as
W = AΛΣ ,
(9.42b)
where the constant A, which depends on the speciﬁc
molecular state, is called the molecular ﬁne structure
constant. Each molecular electronic state composed
of atomic states with angular momenta LA and LB
and with Λ ̸= 0 and S ̸= 0 splits into (2S + 1) ﬁne

9.3.5 Electron Conﬁgurations
and Molecular Ground States
In order to calculate the different electronic states of
diatomic molecules with N electrons, the molecular or-
bitals are determined by using wave functions of the
type (9.34). These orbitals are arranged according to
increasing energy. For the molecular ground state, each
of these orbitals is occupied with two electrons with
opposite spins until all electrons are put into the lowest
N/2 (for even N) or (N + 1)/2 (for odd N) orbitals.
For excited electronic states one of the electrons is
brought from an occupied into a higher unoccupied
orbital.
The molecular orbitals are characterized by the in-
dex n = 1, 2, 3, labeling the energetic order, the orbital
angular momentum quantum number l of the electron,
and its projection quantum number λ.
The calculations give the following energetic order
of the orbitals ψ(n,l, λ) with the nomenclature shown
in Table 9.1:
1sσ, 2sσ, 2pσ, 2pπ, 3sσ, 3pσ, 3pπ, 3dσ,
3dπ, 3dδ, 4sσ, . . . ,
where the Latin letter indicates the atomic orbital,
which gives the major contribution to the molecular
orbital.
For homonuclear diatomics each of these orbitals
can be realized with gerade as well as with unger-
ade symmetry. For these molecules there are there-
fore twice as many orbitals as for heteronuclear
molecules.
For the characterization of a molecular state all oc-
cupied molecular orbitals are written with an exponent
1 or 2, indicating the number of electrons in this orbital.
For example the ground state of the lithium molecule
Li2 with six electrons, formed by two Li-atoms in their
2S1/2 ground states is
Li2 11Σ
+
g : (1sσg)2(1sσu)2(2sσg)2 .
This composition of a molecular state by the orbitals of
the different electrons is called the electron conﬁgura-
tion.
Since the lowest fully occupied atomic 1s orbitals
do not contribute much to the molecular binding (they
are localized in the atomic K-shell around their atomic
nucleus) they are often abbreviated by K, and the above
electron conﬁguration is written as
Li2 11Σ+
g (K K(2sσg)2) .
In Table 9.5 the electron conﬁgurations, the in-
ternuclear distances
Re
at the minimum energy
and the binding energies for the ground states
of some homonuclear molecules are listed togeth-
er with the spin orientations, and in Table 9.6 the
same quantities for some heteronuclear molecules are
compiled.

As we have discussed for the H+
2 and H2 molecules
the σg orbitals lead to a negative binding energy, i.e.,
to bound molecules, while the σu orbitals result in
repulsive potential curves and therefore to unstable
molecules. The σg orbitals are therefore called bonding
orbitals, and the σu orbitals called antibonding.
In the H2 molecule both electrons are in the bond-
ing 1σg orbital. Without the repulsion between the two
electrons the binding energy EB(Re) of H2 should be
twice as large as for H+
2 . The positive repulsion energy
decreases the binding energy slightly. The equilibrium
distance Re is slightly smaller than for H+
2 , because the
larger negative charge of the two electrons between the
two nuclei decreases the nuclear repulsion and shifts Re
towards a lower value than for H+
2 .
For He+
2 with three electrons, the third electron
has to occupy the next higher orbital 1σu, which is
antibonding. Therefore, the binding energy of He+
2 is
smaller than that of H2 and its equilibrium distance Re
is larger.
For the neutral He2 molecule the binding contri-
bution of the two electrons in the 1σg orbital are
nearly cancelled by the antibonding energy of the
1σu orbital and the binding energy of He2 is with
EB = 0.00001 eV extremely small. For temperatures
T > 1 K the He2 molecule in its ground state is
unstable [9.7].
The Li2-molecule has, in addition to the He2 con-
ﬁguration, two electrons in the bonding 2sσg orbital
which contribute to the binding energy. The ground
state of Li2 is therefore stable and has a binding energy
of EB = 1 eV.
The electron conﬁguration in the ground state of the
B2 molecule is (Fig. 9.21)
B2(K K(2sσ g)2(2sσ u)2(2pπu)2 .
This conﬁguration can lead to the three molecular states
3Σ−
g , 1Δg and 1Σ+
g where the 3Σ−
g state has the low-
est energy. Similarly to the situation in atoms (see
Sect. 6.2) this is due to Hund’s rule that the state with
the highest multiplicity has the lowest energy.
The 1Δg state is the ﬁrst excited state where the two
electrons are still in the 2pπu state but have antiparallel
spins.

For heteronuclear molecules the distinction be-
tween gerade and ungerade states is dropped and there
are only half as many orbitals than in homonuclear
molecules.
9.3.6 Excited Molecular States
If one of the electrons in the occupied orbitals of the
ground state is excited into an orbital with higher ener-
gy, excited electronic states are formed with energies
En(R), that depend on the internuclear distance R.
Within the model of the rigid molecule, we obtain for
each of these states a potential energy curve E(R),
which converges for R →∞towards the dissociation
into the separated atoms A + B∗or A∗+ B, i.e., into
a ground state atom and an excited atom. In Fig. 9.22
some of these potential curves are shown for the molec-
ular ion H+
2 . The principle quantum number is counted
for each symmetry type separately, i.e. the lowest σu
state is numbered as 1σu, the lowest πu state also
as 1πu, etc. The ﬁgure illustrates that for this sys-
tem all excited states are unstable and dissociate into
the fragments H+ + H∗. The reason for this is that
the wave functions for the excited states are spatially
spread out and therefore the remaining electron charge
distribution between the two protons is too small to
compensate for the Coulomb repulsion between the
two protons.
For molecules with more electrons there are gen-
erally many bound excited states. For illustration, the

2 molecular ion
potential curves of the Li2 are shown in Fig. 9.23.
Besides the singly excited states, doubly excited states
can also be found where two electrons are excited in-
to higher orbitals. These states dissociate for R →∞
into two excited Li-atoms. For all these states the core
electrons in the 1s atomic shells are barely affected by
the excitation of one or two electrons from the outer
2sσ orbital into higher unoccupied orbitals. They do
not contribute to the molecular binding.
If one electron is excited into high energy states
closely below the ionization limit, molecular Rydberg
states are formed. Since this electron is far away from
the core, it barely affects the molecular binding. The
potential curves of these Rydberg states are therefore
similar to the potential curve of the molecular ion.
For the formation of molecules from two atoms
with closed inner shells the electrons in these inner
shells barely contribute to the molecular binding en-
ergy. They stay concentrated around “their” nucleus
when the molecule is formed, while the electrons from
the atomic valence shell are rearranged into molecu-
lar orbitals covering the volume around the two nu-
clei. The molecular binding energy is therefore mainly
caused by these valence electrons. Their spatial rear-
rangement leads to a minimization of the total energy
at a certain distance Re between the nuclei, which is
the reason for the binding of the two atoms into a stable
molecule.

9.3.7 Excimers
We have seen in Sect. 9.3.5 that two helium atoms
in their ground states can not form a stable molecule,
because the electrons are so tightly bound to their nu-
cleus, that their wave functions can not form a spatially
extended binding orbital. The situation is different for
excited He∗atoms, where the binding energy of the ex-
cited electron is only about 1
4 of that in the ground state.
The electron can then be more readily removed from
its nucleus and brought into a binding orbital between
the two atoms when another atom approaches the He∗.

Fig. 9.24. Two potential curves of an excimer showing the
continuous emission spectrum
Indeed He∗
2 dimers have a potential curve E(R) with
a minimum (Fig. 9.24). This is also true for other no-
ble gases that form, for example, Ar∗
2 or Xe∗
2 dimers
or mixed excited molecules such as Ar∗Kr, Ar∗Xe or
Kr∗Xe.
Such molecules, with binding potential curves in
excited electronic states but repulsive curves in their
ground state, are called excimers (excited dimers).
Interesting examples of excimers are combinations
of noble gas atoms with halogen atoms that have one
missing electron in their otherwise ﬁlled valence shell.
If such a halogen atom approaches an excited noble gas
atom, the excited electron of the noble gas atom can
gain energy if it ﬁlls the hole in the valence shell of the
halogen atom forming a molecular ion. This leads to
a potential curve E(R) with a minimum.
The ﬂuorescence emitted by these excimers from
levels in the stable energy state Ei into the unstable
ground state has a broad continuous spectrum, because
it terminates on the repulsive potential of the ground
state. The photon energy hν = Ei −Eg(R) depends on
the internuclear distance at which the emission takes
place and covers the range ΔE(R1) −ΔE(R2) when
the excited molecule vibrates back and forth between
R1 and R2 (Fig. 9.24).
Such excimers are ideal candidates for active laser
media. If the upper state can be populated, for instance
by collisions A∗+ B between excited noble gas atoms
A∗and halogen atoms B, inversion is automatically
achieved because the lower state is depopulated by

348

dissociation within less than 10−12 s. A possible exci-
tation scheme is for example
Xe + e−→Xe∗+ e−
Xe∗+ Cl2 →XeCl∗+ Cl
(9.44)
Xe∗+ HCl →XeCl∗+ H .
9.3.8 Correlation Diagrams
The molecular states can be correlated to the corre-
sponding states of the separated atoms (R →∞) and
also to the states of a ﬁctive united atom for R →0
where all electrons form a shell around a nucleus with
charge (ZA + ZB)e. Since the symmetry and the par-
ity of the electronic states of the system AB must be
independent of the distance R, only selected states of
the separated atoms can combine with molecular states
of given symmetry and parity and with such states of
the united atom. This means, for example, that gerade
states of the united atom correlate with gerade states of
the molecule and ungerade with ungerade.
On the left side of Fig. 9.25 the energy levels of
the united atom are shown and on the right side the
energies of the separated atoms, where for singly ex-
cited molecular states one of the atoms is always in its
ground state.
Such correlation diagrams, which combine the cor-
responding states as a function of R by the curves
En(R) =

Φ∗
n(r, R) ˆHΦn(r, R) dτ
(9.45)
are very useful for the correct energy ordering of the
molecular states, because the energetic order of the
atomic states is not necessarily the same as that of
the corresponding molecular states. The strength of
the spin-orbit interaction, for example, generally varies
with R. This has the consequence that the coupling or-
der of the angular momenta li si, L = Σli and S = Σsi
and the splittings of the ﬁne structure components can
change from the united atom (R = 0) to the separated
atoms (R = ∞) (Fig. 9.26). Furthermore, the molecule
can not only dissociate into neutral atoms, but also into
the ion pair A+ + B−.
Here a noncrossing rule, postulated by Eugene
Wigner, is very helpful. It states that curves E(R) of
the same symmetry or parity never cross each oth-
er. This rule can be proved by quantum mechanical
considerations. According to this rule the curve for the

9.4 The Physical Reasons
for Molecular Binding
In this section we will answer the question: “Why
can two neutral atoms combine to form a stable
molecule?”. We will see that depending on the spe-
ciﬁc atoms and on the internuclear distance R several
reasons exist for the molecular binding (Fig. 9.27).

9.4.1 The Chemical Bond
During the discussion of the H2 molecule, we learned
that essentially two effects contribute to the binding
energy of the molecule at the equilibrium distance Re.
The ﬁrst is the spatial rearrangement of the charge
distribution of atomic valence electrons. The electron
density becomes larger between the two nuclei. This
results in an electrostatic attraction between the posi-
tive cores of the two atoms (for H2 these are the two
protons) and the negative electron charge distribution
between them. This effect is emphasized in the va-
lence bond model used in chemistry. In the chemically
bound molecule both atoms share one or more valence
electrons in a common molecular orbital. This is al-
so described in the LCAO approximation where the
molecular orbital is represented by a linear combina-
tion of atomic orbitals.
The second reason is of quantum mechanically na-
ture and cannot be explained by a classical model.
The molecular orbital has a larger spatial extension
then the atomic orbitals. This increases the spatial
uncertainty for the electrons and therefore decreases
their average momentum ⟨|p|⟩and their kinetic energy
⟨Ekin⟩=

p2
/2m, according to Heisenberg’s uncer-
tainty relation. The combination of both effects leads
for stable molecular states to a minimum in the po-
tential curve E(R), since the potential energy E(R)
contains the average kinetic energy of the electrons (see
Sect. 9.1). This second contribution to the molecular
binding is called the exchange interaction, because the
two electrons in the atomic orbitals of the LCAO can be

Both effects are important at internuclear distances
R < ⟨rA⟩+ ⟨rB⟩that are smaller than the sum of the
mean atomic radii ⟨rA⟩and ⟨rB⟩, which give the ex-
tension of the electron clouds in the separated atoms.
For distances smaller than this sum, the orbitals of
the two atoms can overlap forming molecular orbitals
and sharing electrons (Fig. 9.28). Molecular bonds that
are formed due to this effect are called covalent or
homopolar.
One can also describe the chemical binding by
energy conservation. If the energy increase nec-
essary to deform the atomic orbitals when the two
atoms approach each other is smaller than the de-
crease of the total energy (potential energy and
mean kinetic energy of the electrons) in the re-
arranged molecular charge distribution, a stable
molecule is formed. The nuclear distance Re and
the electron charge distribution always arrange
themselves in such a way that the total energy
becomes a minimum.
9.4.2 Multipole Interaction
For larger internuclear distances R > ⟨rA⟩+ ⟨rB⟩,
where the electron clouds of the two atoms no longer
overlap, the chemical binding based on the two effects
discussed above looses its importance. Nevertheless
stable molecules are possible with such large inter-
nuclear distances R, although their binding energy is
smaller. The correct treatment of the effects respon-
sible for these interactions at large distances is based

starts from the multipole expansion of an arbitrary
charge distribution ρ(r) for an observer at a point P
at a distance R from the center of the charge distribu-
tion, which is large compared to the extension of ρ(r)
(Fig. 9.29). We will discuss this model shortly.

The ﬁrst term φM represents the monopole contribu-
tion, which is zero for neutral atoms where - qi = 0.
For ions it gives the main contribution.
The second term φD describes the potential of an
electric dipole with a dipole moment p = - qi · ri,
which is the vector sum of the dipole moments pi =
ei ri formed by the different electrons and the nucleus
at r = 0.
The third term φQM gives the contribution of the
quadrupole moment to the potential, the next terms the
higher moments, such as the octopole or hexadecapole
which are here neglected.
If another atom B with total charge qB, electric
dipole moment pB and quadrupole moment QMB is
placed at the position P(R), the potential energy of the
interaction between A and B can be written as the sum
Epot(A, B) = Epot(qB) + Epot( pB)
(9.48)
+ Epot(4
QMB) + . . .
where
Epot(qB) = qB · φ(p) ,
Epot( pB) = + pB · grad φ(p) ,
(9.49)
Epot(QMB) = 4
QMB · grad EA .
The vector gradient grad EA of the electric ﬁeld EA,
produced by atom A is the tensor
grad E =
+∂E
∂x , ∂E

.
(9.50)
From the expression (9.49) we obtain the follow-
ing contributions to the interaction energy between
A and B.

Fig. 9.32. Electric ﬁeld of a dipole. It has axial symmetry
around the dipole axis
The interaction energy between two permanent
electric dipoles is proportional to the product of
the two dipole moments and depends on their
relative orientation. It decreases as 1/R3 with
increasing distance much faster than the 1/R
Coulomb interaction between two charges.
In Fig. 9.33 the interaction energies between two
electric dipoles are illustrated for some speciﬁc relative
orientations of the two dipoles. Positive potential ener-
gies mean repulsion between the two dipoles, negative
ones attraction. The largest attraction (lowest energy)
is obtained when the two dipoles both point into the
z-direction (Fig. 9.33d). The largest repulsion (high-
est potential energy) have two dipoles pointing into
opposite ±z directions (Fig. 9.33e).
9.4.3 Induced Dipole Moments
and van der Waals Potential
If a neutral atom without permanent dipole moment is
placed in an electric ﬁeld, the opposite forces on the
negative electrons and the positive nucleus shift the
electron charge distribution into the opposite direction
than the nucleus (Fig. 9.34). The centers of the posi-
tive and the negative charges no longer coincide as in
a neutral atom without permanent dipole moment, and
a dipole moment
pind

(9.56a)
is induced by the electric ﬁeld , which is proportional to
the ﬁeld (Fig. 9.35). The constant αA is the electric po-
larizability of atom A and is a measure of the restoring

In molecular physics the interaction between two neu-
tral atoms is of particular importance. For a charge
distribution on the electron shell that is spherically
symmetric on the time average (e.g., for 1s electrons
in the H atom) the time averaged dipole moment has to
be zero. However, there still exists a momentary dipole
moment (Fig. 9.36) that produces according to (9.54)
a momentary electric ﬁeld

(9.60)
which is statistically pointing in all directions and has
a time average of zero. However, if we place another
atom B in the vicinity of A, this ﬁeld induces a dipole
moment in atom B
pind
B = +αBEA ,
(9.61)
which in turn generates an electric ﬁeld at atom A in-
ducing a dipole moment in A. Now the time average of
p or E is no longer zero, because the interaction en-
ergy between the two induced dipoles depend on their
relative orientation and the positions with minimum en-
ergy have a larger probability than those with higher
energies. This leads to an attraction between A and B
which is called a van der Waals interaction and is an
interaction between two induced dipoles. We will now
treat this more quantitatively.
According to (9.55) and Fig. 9.33 the interaction
energy between the two dipoles has a maximum neg-
ative value, when the two dipoles are parallel (ϑA =
ϑB = 0◦or 180◦) (Fig. 9.33d) with their dipole mo-
ments pointing into the ±z-direction. It has a maximum
positive value, when they are antiparallel (ϑA = 0◦,
ϑB = 180◦), pointing into the opposite ±z-directions
(Fig. 9.33e). In the case of induced dipole-dipole inter-
actions both dipole moments are directed along the axis
through the two nuclei, which we choose as z-axis. This
means that ϑA = ϑB = 180◦and p ∥R (Fig. 9.37).
From (9.60) we obtain
EA =

(4πε0)2 and C6 =

This is the van der Waals interaction potential be-
tween two neutral atoms with the polarizabilities αA
and αB. The constant C6, which is proportional to the
product αA · αB of the atomic polarizabilities, is called
the van der Waals constant.
The interaction potential between two neutral
atoms scales for large separations R as R−6. The
attraction is much weaker than between charged
particles.
Note the interaction is attractive (because of the neg-
ative sign) and decreases as 1/R6 with increasing
distance R. It is therefore a short range interaction
compared with the Coulomb-interaction that is ∝1/R,
but has a longer range than the interaction of the
chemical bond, which falls off exponentially with in-
creasing R. The interaction energy is also negative if
the two induced dipoles are orientated antiparallel but
both perpendicular to the z-axis through their centers
(Fig. 9.37b).
The quantum mechanical treatment of the van der
Waals interaction is based on the calculations of the
atomic charge distributions, perturbed by the mutual in-
teraction between A and B. Since only this perturbation
leads to an attraction between the two atoms one needs
a perturbation calculation of second order [9.8, 9],
which is beyond the scope of this book.
If higher order terms in the multipole expansion are
taken into account, the interaction energy between two
atoms includes terms with 1/R8, 1/R10, 1/R12, ... for
the induced quadrupole or octupole interactions. For
homonuclear molecules only even powers n of 1/Rn
can appear for symmetry reasons.
The multipole interaction between two neutral
atoms is only important for internuclear dis-
tances R > ⟨rA⟩+ ⟨rB⟩. For smaller values of R
the overlap of the electron shells of A and B
has to be taken into account, which results in
the above-mentioned exchange interaction and
the electrostatic interaction due to the increased
electron density between the two nuclei.
The total range of R-values can, however, be cov-
ered by the empirical Lenard–Jones potential
ELJ
pot(R) =

R6
(9.66)
where a and b are two parameters that depend on the
two atoms A and B and which are adapted to ﬁt best
the potential curve obtained either experimentally or by
accurate and extensive calculations (Fig. 9.38).
From (9.66) it follows that Epot(R) = 0 for R =
R0 = (a/b)1/6. The minimum of Epot(R) is obtained
for dE/dR = 0. This gives the distance
Re = (2a/b)1/6 = 21/6R0

In molecular physics the minimum of the ground state
potential is generally chosen as Epot(Re) = 0. Instead
of the negative energy E(Re) (which is used if the zero
point is chosen as the energy of the separated ground
state atoms) the positive energy EB = −E(Re) is now
used, which gives the binding energy. EB is slightly
larger than the dissociation energy ED, which is the
energy necessary to dissociate the molecule from its
lowest energy level to the separated atoms at R = ∞.
For |R −Re|/Re ≪1 the higher order terms with
n > 2 can be neglected and we obtain a parabolic
potential in the vicinity of the potential minimum.
The potential energy of a diatomic molecule can
be approximated in the vicinity of the potential
minimum by a parabolic potential (Fig. 9.39).
9.4.5 The Morse Potential
In 1929 P.M. Morse had already proposed an empirical
potential form
Epot(R) = EB

1 −e−a(R−Re) 2
,
(9.70)
which represents the attractive part of the potential with
a much better approximation to the experimental values
than the parabolic potential. This potential converges
for R →∞correctly towards the dissociation ener-
gy ED, while the parabolic potential goes to inﬁnity for
R →∞(Fig. 9.39). The repulsive part of the Morse
potential for R < Re deviates more severely from the
experimental data. (Fig. 9.39) We obtain from (9.70)

while the experimental potential must converge to-
wards the energy levels of the united atom (see
Fig. 9.25).
The Morse potential has the great advantage that
the Schrödinger equation of two atoms vibrating in this
potential can be solved exactly (see Sect. 9.6).
9.4.6 Different Binding Types
Depending on the speciﬁc atoms of a diatomic
molecule and on the internuclear distance, we distin-
guish between the following different binding types.
Covalent binding, caused by the exchange of
electrons in overlapping atomic orbitals. The re-
distribution of the electron charge distribution
leads to an increase in negative charge between
the two positive nuclear charges. It is only im-
portant for internuclear distances R < rA + rB.
Ionic binding between positive and negative ions
occurs if the electron exchange between two atoms
A and B leads to an increased electron density at atom
A and a decreased density at B (Fig. 9.40). Typical ex-
amples of ionic binding are combinations of atoms in
the ﬁrst column of the periodic table (alkali atoms with

H + Cl →H+Cl−
and
Na + I = Na+I−.
(9.72)
The interaction energy of the ionic bond falls off
with 1/R and is therefore a long-range interac-
tion.
The van der Waals interaction between two neu-
tral polarized atoms with a large equilibrium
distance Re is weak and falls off with 1/R6. It
is therefore a short-range interaction compared to
ionic interactions.
For molecules with more than two atoms, another
interaction can play an important role, in particular for
biological molecules. This is hydrogen bonding, where
two atoms are attracted by a H+ ion (i.e., a proton), be-
tween the two atoms (Fig. 9.41a). The proton polarizes
the two atoms resulting in an attractive interaction with
a binding energy that lies between the weak van der
Waals energy and the strong valence bond.

Examples of hydrogen bonds are water dimers
(H2O)2 (Fig. 9.41b), which can exist in different con-
formations. The structure of large biomolecules such as
DNA is essentially based on hydrogen bonding.
9.5 Rotation and Vibration
of Diatomic Molecules
Up to now we have discussed the electronic states of
rigid molecules, where the nuclei are clamped to a ﬁxed
position. In this section we will improve our model
of molecules and include the rotation and vibration
of diatomic molecules. This means, that we have to
take into account the kinetic energy of the nuclei in
the Schrödinger equation ˆHψ = Eψ, which has been
omitted in the foregoing sections. We then obtain the

where the ﬁrst term represents the kinetic energy of the
nuclei, the second term that of the electrons, the third
represents the potential energy of nuclear repulsion, the
fourth that of the electron repulsion and the last term
the attraction between the electrons and the nuclei.
9.5.1 The Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
Because of their much larger mass, the nuclei in
a molecule move much slower than electrons. This im-
plies that the electrons can nearly immediately adjust
their positions to the new nuclear conﬁguration when
the nuclei move. Although the electronic wave func-
tions ψ(r, R) depend parametrically on the internuclear
distance R they are barely affected by the velocity of
the moving nuclei. The kinetic energy of the nuclear
motion Ekin = 1
2 Mv2 is small compared to that of the
electrons. We therefore write the total Hamiltonian H
in (9.73) as the sum
H = H0 + Tk
of the Hamiltonian H0 of the rigid molecule and Tk of
the kinetic energy of the nuclei. Since the latter is small
compared to the total energy of rigid molecule we can
regard Tk as a small perturbation of H. In this case the
total wave function
ψ(ri, Rk) = χ(Rk) · Φ(ri, Rk)
(9.74)
can be written as the product of the molecular wave
function χ(Rk) (which depends on the positions Rk of
the nuclei), and the electronic wave function Φ(ri, Rk)
of the rigid molecule at arbitrary but ﬁxed nuclear po-
sitions Rk, where the electron coordinates ri are the
variables and Rk can be regarded as a ﬁxed parameter.
This implies that nuclear motion and electronic motion
are independent and the coupling between both is ne-
glected. The total energy E is the sum of the energy
Eel
n (R) of the rigid molecule in the nth electronic state,
which is represented by the potential curve in Fig. 9.42
and the kinetic energy (Evib + Erot) of the nuclei.
Note the total energy is independent of R!
This approximation where the interaction between
nuclear und electron motion is neglected, was ﬁrst in-
troduced 1927 by Max Born and Robert Oppenheimer
and is therefore called Born-Oppenheimer approxima-
tion. Because of the neglected interaction the total wave
function can be written as the product of the elec-
tronic wave function, which describes the molecule
Fig. 9.42. Energy Eeln (R) of the rigid molecule and total
energy E of the nonrigid vibrating and rotating molecule

358
9. Diatomic Molecules
with clamped nuclei and the nuclear wave function
which describes the vibration of the nuclei and the ro-
tation of the whole molecule. Its physical meaning is,
that the vibration of the nuclei does not change the
electronic state.
This approximation is valid for the electronic
ground states of most molecules. For higher electronic
states one often observes a breakdown of the BO-
approximation, where the vibration can induce a cou-
pling between different electronic states which means
that the vibrating nuclei do no longer move in a well de-
ﬁned potential of a single electronic state but changes
the electronic conﬁguration during the vibration [9.10].

equation

(9.79)
where M = MAMB/(MA + MB) is the reduced mass
of the two nuclei and the index m gives the mth
quantum state of the nuclear movement (vibrational-
rotational state).
The important result of this equation is:
The potential energy for the nuclear motion in
the electronic state (n, L, Λ) depends only on the
nuclear distance R, not on the angles ϑ and ϕ,
i.e., it is independent of the orientation of the
molecule in space. It is spherically symmetric.
The wave functions χ = χ(R, ϑ, ϕ), however,
may still depend on all three variables R, ϑ,
and ϕ.
Because of the spherically symmetric potential
equation (9.79) is mathematically equivalent to the
Schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom. The differ-
ence lies only in the different radial dependence of the
potential. Analogous to the treatment in Sect. 4.3.2 we
can separate the wave functions χ(R, ϑ, ϕ) into a ra-
dial part depending solely on R and an angular part,
depending solely on the angles ϑ and ϕ. We therefore
try the product ansatz
χ(R, ϑ, ϕ) = S(R) · Y(ϑ, ϕ) .
(9.80)
The radial function S(R) depends on the radial form

ics Y(ϑ, ϕ) are solutions for all spherically symmetric
potentials, independent of their radial form.
Inserting the product (9.80) into (9.79) gives, as

9.5. Rotation and Vibration of Diatomic Molecules
359
While the ﬁrst Eq. (9.81a) describes the vibration of the
diatomic molecule, (9.81b) determines its rotation. We
will at ﬁrst discuss eq. (9.81b).
9.5.2 The Rigid Rotor
A diatomic molecule with the atomic masses MA and
MB can rotate around any axis through the center of
mass perpendicular to the internuclear axis with the
angular velocity ω (Fig. 9.43). Its rotational energy is
then
Erot = 1
2 Iω2 = J 2/(2I) .
(9.82)
Here
I = MAR2
A + MBR2
B = M R2
(M = MAMB/
(MA + MB)) is the moment of inertia of the molecule
with respect to the rotational axis and |J| = Iω is its
rotational angular momentum. For a rotation around the
internuclear axis the contribution of the nuclei to the
moment of inertia is vanishingly small, because they lie
on this axis. The contribution of the electron shell is al-
so small because of the small electron mass. Therefore
the rotational energy for a rotation around this axis is
very large and cannot be excited at thermal energies.
The electronic contribution has only to be taken into
account for electronic states with Λ > 0 and is then
added to the electronic energy (see Sect. 9.5.4). Since
the square of the angular momentum
|J|2 = J(J + 1)¯h2
can take only discrete values that are determined by the
rotational quantum number J, the rotational energies of
a molecule in its equilibrium position with an internu-
clear distance Re are represented by a series of discrete
values
Erot = J(J + 1)¯h2
2M R2e
.

M R2e
(9.84)
increases linearly with J (Fig. 9.44).
This result can also be directly obtained from
(9.80). For a ﬁxed nuclear distance R the ﬁrst term in
(9.81a) is zero. Therefore the second term must also be
zero, because the sum of the two terms is zero. The ki-
netic energy of a rigid rotor, which does not vibrate, is
Ekin = Erot = E −Epot, where E is the total energy.
The bracket of the second term in (9.80) then becomes
for R = Re equal to (9.83).
In the spectroscopic literature, the rotational term
values F(J) = E(J)/hc are used instead of the ener-
gies. Instead of (9.83) we write
Frot(J) = J(J + 1)¯h2

with the rotational constant
Be =
¯h
4πcM R2e
,
(9.86)
which is determined by the reduced mass M and the
equilibrium nuclear distance Re. For historical reasons
one writes Be in units of cm−1 instead of m−1.
EXAMPLES
1. The H2 molecule has a reduced mass M =
0.5MH = 8.35 × 10−28 kg,
and
the
equilib-
rium
distance
Re = 0.742 × 10−10 m ⇒I =
4.60 × 10−48 kg m2. The rotational energies are
Erot(J) = 1.2 × 10−21 J(J + 1) Joule
= 7J(J + 1) meV .
The rotational constant is Be = 60.80 cm−1.
2. For
the
HCl
molecule
the
ﬁgures
are
M = 0.97 AMU = 1.61 × 10−27 kg, Re = 1.27 ×
10−10 m ⇒Erot = 2.1 × 10−22 J(J + 1) Joule =
1.21 J(J + 1) meV, Be = 10.59 cm−1.
In Table 9.7 the equilibrium distances Re and
the rotational constants are listed for some diatomic
molecules. The ﬁgures show that the rotational energies
are within the range of
Erot = (10−6–10−2) J(J + 1) eV .
For a rotational angular momentum J the classical
relation between J, circular frequency ω = 2πν and
moment of inertia I is ⃗J = ⃗ω · I. This gives with
| ⃗J| = √J(J + 1)¯h and |⃗ω| = 2πν for the rotational
period Trot = 1/ν
Trot =
2π I/¯h
√J(J + 1) .
(9.87)
Depending on the rotational constant Be the rotational
periods range from Trot = 10−14 s to 10−10 s. For Be =
1 cm−1 one obtains Trot = 1.6 × 10−11/√J(J + 1) s.
If an electro-magnetic wave falls onto a sample of
molecules it can be absorbed on rotational transitions
J →J + 1 resulting in absorption lines with frequen-
cies
νrot(J) = [E(J + 1)] −E(J)]/h
(9.88a)
or, in wavenumber units cm−1,
νrot(J) = 2Be(J + 1) .
(9.88b)
The rotational transitions between levels J and J +1
fall into the spectral range with frequencies ν =
109–1013 Hz, i.e., in the Gigahertz–Terahertz range
with wavelengths between λ = 10−5–10−1 m. This
spectral region is called the microwave range.
In Sect. 9.6.2 we will see, that only molecules
with a permanent electric dipole moment can
absorb or emit radiation on rotational tran-
sitions
(except
for
very
weak
quadrupole
transitions). Therefore homonuclear diatomic
molecules show no rotational absorption or emis-
sion spectra!

9.5.3 Centrifugal Distortion
A real molecule is not rigid. When it rotates, the
centrifugal force acts on the atoms and the internu-
clear distance widens to a value R where this force
⃗Fc = Mω2 ⃗R is compensated by the restoring force
⃗Fr = −(dEpot/dR) ˆR holding the two atoms together,
which depends on the slope of the potential energy
function Epot(R) (Fig. 9.45).
In the vicinity of the equilibrium distance Re the
potential can be approximated by a parabolic function
(see Sect. 9.4.4). This leads to a linear restoring force
Fr = −k(R −Re) ˆR .
(9.89)
From the relation centripetal force = restoring force:
Mω2R = k(R −Re) we obtain with J 2 = I 2ω2 =
M2R4ω2
Mω2R = J(J + 1)¯h2
M R3
!= k(R −Re)
⇒R = Re + J(J + 1)¯h2

,
(9.90)
which means that the internuclear distance R is
widened by the molecular rotation.
If we approximate R on the right side of (9.90) by
Re and k we obtain

For a given value of the rotational quantum num-

ment of inertia larger and therefore the rotational
energy smaller. This effect overcompensates for
the increase in potential energy.

When ﬁtting spectroscopic data by (9.95) this constant,
therefore, has to be taken into account.
9.5.4 The Inﬂuence of the Electron Motion
Up to now we have neglected the inﬂuence of the elec-
tron motion on the rotation of molecules. In the axial
symmetric electrostatic ﬁeld of the two nuclei in the
nonrotating molecule, the electrons precess around the

362
9. Diatomic Molecules
space-ﬁxed molecular z-axis. The angular momentum
L(R) = Σli(R) of the electron shell, which depends
on the separation R of the nuclei, has, however, a con-
stant projection
⟨Lz⟩= Λ¯h
(9.96a)
independent of R. For molecular states with electron
spin S ̸= 0 in atoms with weak spin-orbit coupling the
spin S precesses independently around the z-axis with
a projection
⟨Sz⟩= Ms¯h .
(9.96b)
Both projections add to the total value
Ω ¯h = (Λ + Ms)¯h .
(9.96c)
In the case of strong spin-orbit coupling L and S couple
to Jel = L + S with the projection

J el
z
	
= Ω ¯h
(see Sect. 9.3.3).
The total angular momentum J of the rotating mol-
ecule is now composed of the angular momentum N
of the molecular rotation and the projection Λ¯h or
Ω ¯h. For Ω ̸= 0 the total angular momentum J of
the molecule is no longer perpendicular to the z-axis
(Fig. 9.46).
Since the total angular momentum of a free
molecule without external ﬁelds is constant in
time, the molecule rotates around the space-ﬁxed
direction of J and for Λ ̸= 0 the rotational axis is
no longer perpendicular to the molecular z-axis.
In a simple model, the whole electron shell can
be regarded as a rigid charge distribution that rotates
around the z-axis. The rotating molecule can then be
described as a symmetric top with two different mo-
ments of inertia: 1.) The moment I1 of the electron shell
rotating around the z-axis and 2.) the moment I2 of the
molecule (nuclei and electrons) rotating around an axis
perpendicular to the z-axis. Because the electron mass-
es are very small compared with the nuclear masses, it
follows that I1 ≪I2.
The rotational energy of this symmetric top is

9.5. Rotation and Vibration of Diatomic Molecules

The term AΩ2, which does not depend on J, is gen-
erally added to the electronic energy Te of the molec-
ular state, since it is constant for all rotational levels
of a given electronic state with quantum number Ω.
It is therefore also not inﬂuenced by the centrifugal
distortion.
The ground states of the majority of diatomic
molecules are 1Σ-states with Λ = Ω = 0. For these
cases (9.99) is identical to (9.85).
9.5.5 Vibrations of Diatomic Molecules
For a nonrotating molecule, the rotational quantum
number J in (9.81a) is zero. Around the minimum
the potential energy Epot ∼1/2 · kr(R −Re)2 can be ap-
proximated by a parabola. If we choose the minimum
of the potential energy at Re = 0 it becomes
Epot ∼1/2kr · R2 = 1/2ω2M R2 with ω =
$
kr/M.
Inserting this into equ. (9.81a) and replacing the func-
tion S by ψvib = R · S(R) we obtain
d2 ψvib
dR2
+ 2M
¯h2

E−1
2ω2M

ψvib = 0.
The solutions ψvib(R) of this equation are the vibra-
tional wave functions. They can be written as the prod-
uct of an exponential function and a Hermite polynom
Hv(R) [9.11]
ψvib(R) = exp[−(Mω/¯h)R2] · Hv(R)
(9.101)
where v is the vibrational quantum number (see
Sect. 4.2.5 and Table 4.1). For a parabolic potential, the
vibrating molecule is a harmonic oscillator, which has
been already treated in Sect. 4.2.5. The result obtained
there was the quantization of the energy levels.
The energy levels of the harmonic oscillator
E(v) =

v + 1
2

¯hω
(9.102)
depend on the integer vibrational quantum number v =
0, 1, 2, . . ..
They are equally spaced by ΔE = ¯hω. The fre-
quency ω = √kr/M depends on the constant kr =
(d2Epot/dR2)Re in the parabolic potential and on the re-
duced mass M of the molecule. The lowest vibrational
level is not E = 0 but E = 1
2 ¯hω. Some of these vi-
brational eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator are
compiled in Table 4.1 and are illustrated in Fig. 4.20.
Although the real potential of a diatomic molecule
can be well approximated by a parabolic potential
in the vicinity of the potential minimum at R = Re,
it deviates more and more for larger |R −Re| (see
Fig. 9.39). This ﬁgure also illustrates that the Morse
potential is a much better approximation. Inserting the
Morse potential
Epot(R) = EB

1 −e−a(R−Re) 2
(9.103)
into the radial part (9.81a) of the Schrödinger equation
allows its exact analytical solution (see Problem 9.5).

determined.

the Schrödinger equation can only be solved numeri-
cally. We will, however, see in Sect. 9.5.7 that the real
potential can be very accurately determined from the
measured term values of the rotational and vibrational
levels.
Note:
•
The distance between vibrational levels decreases
with increasing v, but stays ﬁnite up to the dissoci-
ation energy. This means that only a ﬁnite number
of vibrational levels ﬁt into the potential well of
a bound molecular state. This is in contrast to the
inﬁnite number of electronic states in an atom such
as the H atom. Here the distance between Rydberg
levels converges with n →∞towards zero (see
(3.88)). This different behavior stems from the dif-
ferent radial dependence of the potentials in the two
cases.
•
One has to distinguish between the experimental-
ly determined dissociation energy Eexp
D , where the
molecule is dissociated from its lowest vibration
level, and the binding energy EB of the potential
well, which is measured from the minimum of the
potential (Fig. 9.42). The difference is
Eexp
D
= EB −1

9.5.6 Interaction Between Rotation
and Vibration
Up to now we have looked at the rotation of a non-
vibrating molecule and the vibration of a nonrotating
molecule. Of course a real molecule can simultane-
ously rotate and vibrate. Since the vibrational fre-
quency is higher than the rotational frequency by one
to two orders of magnitude, the molecule undergoes
many vibrations (typically 5–100) during one rotational
period (Fig. 9.47). This means that the nuclear distance
changes periodically during one full rotation.

1. For
the

molecule,
ωe = 4401cm−1 ⇒

while

Be =60.8 cm−1 ⇒Trot =
"
2c Be · √J(J + 1)
#−1 =
2.7 × 10−13/√J(J + 1) s.
2. For the Na2 molecule, ωe = 150 cm−1 ⇒Tvib =
2.2 × 10−13 s
and
Be = 0.15 cm−1 ⇒Trot =
1.1 × 10−10/√J(J + 1) s.
Since the total angular momentum J = I · ω of
a freely rotating molecule has to be constant in time,
but the moment of inertia I periodically changes, the
rotational frequency ω has to change accordingly with
a period Tvib. Therefore the rotational energy
Erot = J(J + 1)¯h2
2mR2
also varies periodically with a period Tvib.
Because the total energy E = Erot + Evib + Epot
has to be constant, there is a periodic exchange of
rotational, vibrational and potential energy in the
vibrating rotor.
In a classical picture this energy ﬂow between
potential energy and kinetic energy of vibration and
rotation can be illustrated by Fig. 9.48.
The rotational energy obtained from the time-
independent Schrödinger equation (9.81a), is the time
average over a vibrational period. This time average
can be calculated as follows:
The probability to ﬁnd the nuclei within the interval
dR around the distance R is
P(R)dR = |ψvib(R)|2dR .
The quantum mechanical expectation values of R and

Note:
Even for a harmonic potential the expectation value of
1/R2 depends on the vibrational quantum number v. It
increases with v although ⟨R⟩is independent of v and
always equal to Re (Fig. 9.48). Therefore, the rotation-
al constant Bv of the rotating harmonic oscillator also
depends on v. For the more realistic anharmonic poten-
tial, both ⟨R⟩as well as

1/R2
change with v. While
⟨R⟩increases


(9.80))
Eeff
pot(R) = E(v)
pot(R) + J(J + 1)¯h2
2M R2
(9.117)
includes, besides the potential Epot(R) of the nonro-
tating molecule, a centrifugal term that depends on
the rotational quantum number J and falls off with R
as 1/R2. For a bound electronic state this leads to
a maximum of Eeff
pot(R) at a distance Rm, which can
be obtained by setting the ﬁrst derivative of (9.117) to
zero. This distance
Rm =
%
J(J + 1)¯h2
M(dEpot/dR)
&1/3
(9.118)
depends on the rotational quantum number J and on
the slope of the rotationless potential. (Fig. 9.49)
The minimum of the potential is shifted by the ro-
tation of the molecule from Re to larger distances and
the dissociation energy becomes smaller.
Energy levels E(v, J) above the dissociation energy
ED can be still stable, if they are below the maxi-
mum of the centrifugal potential barrier. However, due
to the tunnel effect (Sect. 4.2.3) molecules in these
levels can dissociate by tunneling through the barrier
(Fig. 9.50). This effect is called predissociation by tun-
neling. The tunnel probability depends exponentially
on the width of the barrier and on the energy gap be-
tween the maximum of the barrier and the level energy.
(see Sect. 4.2.3)
The predissociation rate can be determined by mea-
suring the width δE = h/τ of levels with a lifetime τ.
If the predissociation rate is large compared to the
radiative decay of a level, the lifetime τ is mainly deter-
mined by predissociation. Measuring τ(v) for all levels

9.6 Spectra of Diatomic Molecules
When a molecule undergoes a transition
Ei(ni, Λi, vi, Ji) ↔Ek(nk, Λk, vk, Jk)
between two molecular states |i⟩and |k⟩, electro-
magnetic radiation can be absorbed or emitted with
a frequency ν = ΔE/h. Whether this transition real-
ly occurs depends on its transition probability, which
is proportional to the absolute square of the dipole
matrix element Mik (see Sect. 7.1). The relative inten-
sities of spectral lines can therefore be determined if
the matrix elements of the transitions can be calculat-
ed. Because of the larger variety of molecular states,
with energies depending on the electronic, the rota-
tional and vibrational structure of the molecule, the
matrix elements of molecules are more complicated
than those of atoms. In this section we will discuss
their structure and the molecular spectra derived from
them.
For spontaneous emission (ﬂuorescence spectra)
the emission probability of a transition |i⟩→|k⟩is
given by the Einstein coefﬁcient Aik. According to
(7.17) Aik is related to the transition dipole matrix
element Mik by
Aik = 2

(9.119a)
For the absorption or stimulated emission of radiation
the transition probability Pik = Bikw(νik) is propor-
tional to the spectral energy density w(ν) of the radi-
ation ﬁeld. In Sect. 7.1.3 it was shown that Pik is given
by
Pik = π

ψ∗
k ε · pψi dτ|2
(9.119b)
where ε = E/|E| is the unit vector in the direction of
the electric ﬁeld E of the electromagnetic wave, in-
cident onto the molecules. The transition probability
therefore depends on the scalar product ε · p of elec-
tric ﬁeld vector and electric transition dipole p = e · r
of the molecule.
9.6.1 Transition Matrix Elements
The dipole matrix element for a transition between
two molecular states of a diatomic molecule with wave
functions ψi and ψk is
Mik =


ψ∗
i pψkdτel dτN .
(9.119c)
The integration extends over all 3(ZA + ZB) electronic
coordinates and over the six nuclear coordinates. Often
only one of the electrons is involved in the transition.
In this case the integration over dτel only needs to be
performed over the coordinates of this electron. The
vector p is the dipole operator, which depends on the
coordinates of the electrons, involved in the transition
and on the nuclear coordinates. In Fig. 9.51 it can be
seen that
p = −e
.
i
ri + e(ZARA + ZBRB) = pel + pN
(9.120)
where pel is the contribution of the electrons and pN
that of the nuclei.
Note
that for homonuclear molecules ZA = ZB but
RA = −RB. Therefore pN = 0!

Fig. 9.51. Illustration of nuclear and electronic contributions
to the molecular dipole moment
Within the adiabatic approximation we can separate
the total wave function ψ(r, R) into the product
ψ(r, R) = Φ(r, R) × χN(R)
(9.121)
of electronic wave function Φ(r, R) of the rigid
molecule at a ﬁxed nuclear distance R and the nuclear
wave function χ(R); which only depends on the nuclear
coordinates. Inserting (9.120, 9.121) into (9.119) the
matrix elements is written as
Mik =

We distinguish between two different cases (Fig. 9.52):
•
The two levels |i⟩and |k⟩belong to the same elec-
tronic state (Φi = Φk). This means that the dipole
transition occurs between two vibrational-rotational
levels in the same electronic state Φi. In this case
the ﬁrst term in the sum (9.122b) is zero because
the integrand r|Φi|2 is an ungerade function of the
electron coordinates r = {x, y, z}. The integration
from −∞to +∞therefore gives zero.

Since the electronic wave functions Φ are orthonor-
mal, i.e.,

Φ∗
i φk dτel = δik
(9.123)
the integral over the electronic coordinates in the
second term in the sum (9.122b) is equal to one.
The matrix element then becomes

dinates, not on the electronic coordinates!

Transitions between levels in two different electron-
ic states. In this case the integral over the electronic
coordinates in the second term of (9.122b) is zero
because the Φi, Φk are orthonormal. The sec-

becomes

9.6.2 Vibrational-Rotational Transitions
All allowed transitions (vi, Ji) ↔(vk, Jk) between two
rotational-vibrational levels in the same electronic state
form for vi ̸= vk the vibrational-rotational spectrum of
the molecule in the infrared spectral region between
λ = 2 −20 μm. For vi = vk we have pure rotational
transitions between rotational levels within the same
vibrational state, which form the rotational spectrum
in the microwave region with wavelengths in the range
0.1–10cm.
The dipole matrix element for these transitions is
according to (9.120) and (9.124)
Mrot vib

(9.126)
For homonuclear diatomic molecules with ZA = ZB
and MA = MB is RA = −RB and therefore the inte-
grand is zero ⇒Mrot vib
ik
= 0.
Homonuclear
diatomic
molecules
have
no
dipole-allowed
vibrational-rotational
spectra.
This means they do not absorb or emit radia-
tion on transitions within the same electronic
state. They may have very weak quadrupole
transitions.
Note:
The molecules N2 and O2, which represent the major
constituents of our atmosphere, cannot absorb the in-
frared radiation emitted by the earth. Other molecules,
such as CO2, H2O, NH3 and CH4 do have an electric
dipole moment and absorb infrared radiation on their
numerous vibrational-rotational transitions. Although
they are present in our atmosphere only in small con-
centrations they can seriously perturb the delicate en-
ergy balance between absorbed incident solar radiation
and the energy radiated back into space by the earth. If
their concentration is increased by only small amounts
this can increase the temperature of the atmosphere at
the earth’s surface (greenhouse effect).
The structure of the vibration-rotation-spectrum
and the pure rotation spectrum of heteronuclear
molecules can be determined as follows.
Since the interaction potential between the two
atoms is spherically symmetric, we choose spherical
coordinates for the description of the nuclear wave
function χN(R, ϑ, ϕ).
With
R = |RA −RB|
and
RA/RB = MB/MA
(Figs. 9.43 and 9.51) and ˆp = p/|p| the dipole moment
can be written as
pN = ˆp · |pN| = e MB · ZA −MA · ZB
MA + MB
· R · ˆp
= po · ˆp with po = e · R · MBZa −MaZB
MA + MB
(9.127)
The vector pN of the electric dipole moment is de-
ﬁned in the coordinate system (x,y,z) of the molecular
frame while the electric ﬁeld vector of the electromag-
netic wave is deﬁned in the laboratory frame (X;Y;Z).

The transformation from the (x,y,z = system into the

cessive rotations around the axis (x,y,z) by angles α,ß,γ
called the Euler angles (Fig. 9.53). While the orienta-
tion of p against the axis x,y,z can be described by the
angles ϑ and ϕ (Fig. 9.54), its orientation against the
axis X;Y;Z is described by the angles θ and Φ. Since
for diatomic molecules pN is directed along the molec-
ular axis, which is the z-axis, the angle ϑ is zero and the

transformation is easy. The components of the dipole
moment in the space ﬁxed coordinate system are
pX = p0 · sin d ! cos Φ
pY = p0 · sin ! sin Φ
pZ = p0 · cos ! .
Note:
For polyatomic molecules the nuclear dipole moment
pN can have any direction (ϑ, ϕ) in the molecular
frame. The transformation into the space-ﬁxed coordi-
nate system now has to use the transformation matrix
containing the Euler angles (Fig. 9.53).
If the interaction between rotation and vibration is
sufﬁciently weak we can write χN as the product
χN(R, ϑ, ϕ) = ψvib(R)Y M
J (ϑ, ϕ)
(9.128)
of the vibrational wave function ψvib = R · S(R) in
(9.102) and the rotational wave function Y M
J (ϑ, ϕ) for
a rotational level with angular momentum J and its
projection M · ¯h onto the quantization axis, which is a
preferential direction in the laboratory coordinate sys-
tem. For absorbing transition the quantization axis is,
for instance, the direction of the incident electromag-
netic wave, or the direction of its E-vector.
Since the vibrational wavefunction ψvib depends
solely on the internuclear distance R while the spher-
ical harmonics depends solely on the angles Θ and Φ
in the space ﬁxed system, we can write the transition
dipole matrix element with dτN = R2dR sin ϑdϑdϕ as
a product of two integrals
Mik = ∫ψ∗
vib,ip0ψvib,kdR
× ∫YJi MiˆpYJkMk sin ΘϑdΘdΦ
(9.129)
where we have used the abbreviation p = p0ˆp and the
fact, that the unit vector ˆp = pN/| pN| = pN/ p0 is di-
rected along the internuclear axis and has an orientation
that depends solely on Θ and Φ.
The transition probability per sec for an absorbing

(9.130b)
The ﬁrst factor in (9.130a) describes the vibrational
transition vi ↔vk. If the harmonic oscillator functions
are used for the vibrational functions ψvib(R) the cal-
culations of the integral shows that the integral is zero,
unless
Δv = vi −vk = 0
or
± 1.
(9.131)
The + sign stands for absorbing, the minus sign for
emitting transitions. Transitions with Δv = 0 are pure
rotational transitions within the same vibrational level.
This selection rule means that for the harmon-
ic oscillator only transitions between neighboring
vibrational levels are allowed.
For anharmonic potentials, such as the Morse po-
tential, higher order transitions with Δv = ±2, ±3, . . .
are also observed. Such overtone-transitions are, how-
ever, much weaker than the fundamental transitions
with Δv = ±1.
The second integral in (9.129) describes the rota-
tional transitions. It depends on the orientation of the
molecular dipole moment p in space.
The amplitude of the radiation emitted into the
direction k in space is proportional to the product
|⃗k × ⃗p|. For absorbing transitions it is proportional
to the scalar product E · p of electric ﬁeld ampli-
tude and molecular dipole moment p. The intensity is
proportional to the square of this amplitude.
With the orientation angles ! and φ of ˆp = p/| p|
against the space-ﬁxed axis X; Y; Z we obtain the
relation (Fig. 9.54)
ˆε · p =p0(εx sin ! cos φ + εy sin ! sin φ
+ εz cos !)
(9.132a)
where εi is the ith component of ˆε = E/|E| against
the space ﬁxed axis i = X, Y, Z. The angles can be

with the result that these integrals are always zero,
except for ΔJ = Ji −Jk = ±1.
This selection rule is readily understandable, be-
cause the absorbed or emitted photon has the spin s =
±1h and the total angular momentum of the system
photon + molecule has to be conserved.
For the projection quantum number M the selection
rules are analogue to that for atoms:
ΔM = 0 for linear polarization of the radiation and
ΔM = ±1 for circular polarization.
Note:
The angle ϑ is measured against the molecular axis in
the molecular coordinate system, while ! and φ are
the angles between the molecular dipole moment and
the space ﬁxed quantization axis (see above).
In order to save indices in spectroscopic literature
the upper state (vk, Jk) is always labeled with a prime
as (v′, J ′), whereas the lower state (vi, Ji) is labeled
with a double prime as (v′′, J ′′). Transitions with
ΔJ = J ′ −J ′′ = +1

9. Diatomic Molecules
are called R-transitions, those with
ΔJ = J ′ −J ′′ = −1
are P-transitions.
All allowed rotational transitions appear in the
spectrum as absorption- or emission lines (Fig. 9.55).
All rotational lines of a vibrational transition form a vi-
brational band. Its rotational structure is given by the
wavenumbers of all rotational lines

a ﬁctious Q-line with J ′ = J ′′ = 0. Since this line does
not exist in rotational-vibrational spectras of diatomic
molecules, there is a missing line at ν = ν0 (Fig. 9.55).
Since

the rotational and vibrational constants depend on the
reduced mass M the lines of different isotopomers are
shifted against each other.
9.6.3 The Structure of Electronic Transitions
We will now evaluate the matrix element (9.125) for
electronic transitions. The electronic part Mel
ik(R) de-
pends on the internuclear distance R, because the elec-
tronic wave functions Φ depend parametrically on R.
In many cases the dependence on R is weak and we
can expand Mel
ik(R) into a Taylor series

In a ﬁrst approximation only the ﬁrst term, indepen-
dent of R, is considered, which can be regarded as
an average of Mik(R) over the range of R-values cov-
ered by the vibrating molecule. In this case the constant
Mik(Re) can be put before the integral over the nuclear
coordinates. Using the normalized nuclear wave func-
tions χN = ψvib · Y(ϑ, ϕ) the matrix element becomes

where M ¯h is the projection of the rotational angular
momentum J onto a selected axis (for instance, in the
direction of the E-vector or the k-vector of the incident
electromagnetic wave for absorbing transitions, or in
the direction from the emitting molecule to the observer
for ﬂuorescent transitions). Different from the nucle-
ar part of the molecular dipole moment in Eq. (9.124),
which is directed along the internuclear axis, the elec-
tronic part of the dipole moment can have any direction
in the molecular coordinate system. The transformation
to the space ﬁxed system is therefore more complicated
and has to use a transformation matrix, which contains
the Euler angles.
Note:
This approximation of an electric transition dipole mo-
ment independent of R is, for many molecules with
a strong dependence Mel
ik(R), too crude (Fig. 9.58).
In such cases also the second term in the expansion
(9.134) has to be taken into account.

a) The General Structure
of Electronic Transitions
Molecular electronic spectra have structures as shown
in (Fig. 9.59).
All allowed transitions J ′′
i ←→J ′
k between the ro-
tational levels J ′
k of a given vibrational level v′ in the
upper electronic state and J ′′
i of v′′ in the lower elec-
tronic state form a band. In absorption or ﬂuorescence
spectra such a band consists of many rotational lines.
Transitions with ΔJ = 0 form the Q-branch, those
with ΔJ = J ′

Fig. 9.59. Schematic representation of the structure of molec-
ular transitions
ΔJ = −1 the P-branch. Q-branches are only present
in transitions where the electronic angular momentum
changes by 1¯h, (e.g., for Σ ↔Π transitions) in order
to compensate for the spin of the absorbed or emit-
ted photon. Electronic transitions with ΔΛ = 0 (e.g.,
between two Σ-states) have only P and R branches.
The total system of all vibrational bands of this
electronic transition is called a band system. The to-
tal number of lines in such a band system depends not
only on the transition probabilities but also on the num-
ber of populated levels in the lower or upper electronic
state.
The intensities of the lines in the emission spectrum
are proportional to the population of the emitting upper
levels and to the transition probability Aik the photon
emission rate is
˙Nphot = Nk Aik
(9.140a)
The intensity is then I em
ik ∝h · ν · ˙Nphot. The number
of emitting levels depends on the excitation mecha-
nism. Generally, the energy of the upper electronic
state is for T = 300 K large compared to the thermal
energy kT . Therefore the thermal population is negligi-
ble. Optical pumping with lasers allows the population
of single selected levels. In this case the ﬂuorescence
spectrum becomes very simple because it is emitted
from a single upper level. In gas discharges, many
upper levels are excited by electron impact and the
number of lines in the emission spectrum becomes very
large.
The absorption spectrum consists of all allowed
transitions from populated lower levels.
Their intensity, as given in Sect. 7.2, is given by
I abs

(9.140b)
At thermal equilibrium the population distribution fol-
lows a Boltzmann distribution

b) Selection Rules for Electronic Dipole Transitions
The integral (9.135a) becomes zero, if the integrand
is an odd function of the electronic coordinates. This

9.6. Spectra of Diatomic Molecules
375
gives the selection rules for the symmetry of the elec-
tronic wavefunctions Φi, Φk:
+↔−and −↔+ but + ↚=→+ and −↚=→−.
For homonuclear diatomics the additional selection
rules hold:
g ↔u and u ↔g but g ↚=→g and u ↚=→u
From angular momentum conservation the selection
rule follows:
ΔΛ = 0 or ± 1,
If spin-orbit coupling is weak, the following selection
rules for the spin quantum number S, its projection
quantum number Σ and the projection number Ω =
Λ + Σ are valid:
ΔS = 0;
ΔΣ = 0;
ΔΩ = 0.
EXAMPLES
The transitions
1Σ ↔1- or
1Σ ↔1Σ
are both
allowed, while the transitions
1Σ ↚=→3- or
1Σ ↚=→3Σ or 1Σ ↚=→1Δ are all dipole forbid-
den.
c) The Rotational Structure
of Electronic Transitions
The wavenumnber of a rotational line in the electron-
ic spectrum of a diatomic molecule corresponding to
a transition (ni, vi, Ji) ↔(nk, vk, Jk) is
νik = (T ′
e −T ′′
e ) +
"
Tvib(v′) −Tvib(v′′)
#
(9.142)
+
"
Trot(J ′) −Trot(J ′′)
#
where Te gives the minimum of the potential curves
Epot(R) of the electronic states |i⟩or |k⟩, Tvib is the
term value of the vibrational state for J = 0 and Trot(J)
the pure rotational term value.
The rotational structure of a vibrational band is then
(similarly to the situation for vibrational–rotational
transitions within the same electronic state) given by
νik = ν0(ni, nk, vi, vk) + B′
v J ′(J ′ + 1)
(9.143)
−D′
v J ′2(J ′ + 1)2
−

B′′
v J ′′(J ′′ + 1) −D′′
v J ′′2(J ′′ + 1)2 
.
In (9.143), the rotational constant B′
v in the upper state
can either be larger or smaller than B′′
v in the lower
electronic state. This depends on the binding energies
and the equilibrium distances Re in the two states. The
Fortrat-Diagrams shown in Fig. 9.60 has a different
structure for each of the two cases.
At those J-values where the curve ν(J) becomes
vertical, the density of rotational lines within a giv-
en spectral interval has a maximum. The derivative
dν/dJ changes its sign. For the case B′′
v > B′
v the
positions ν(J) of the rotational lines increase for R-
lines before the maximum and then decrease again
(Fig. 9.60a). The position νh of this line pileup is called
the band head. For B′′
v > B′
v the R-lines show a band
head at the high frequency side of the band, while for
B′′
v < B′
v the P-lines accumulate in a band head at the
low frequency side (Fig. 9.60b). The line density may

lution the different lines cannot be resolved. This is il-
lustrated by Fig. 9.61, which shows the rotational lines
in the electronic transition of the Cs2 molecule around
the band head, taken with sub-Doppler resolution.
In molecular electronic spectra taken with photo-
graphic detection and medium resolution where only
part of the rotational lines are resolved, a sudden jump
of the blackening on the photoplate appears at the band
head while the line density gradually decreases with
increasing distance from the band head. The band ap-

In cases where the electronic transition allows Q-
lines, their spectral density is higher than that of the P-

d) The Vibrational Structure
and the Franck–Condon Principle
The vibrational structure of electronic transitions is
governed by the Franck–Condon factor (9.137), which
in turn depends on the overlap of the vibrational wave
functions in the two electronic states. In a classical
model, which gives intuitive insight into electronic
transitions, the absorption or emission of a photon oc-
curs within a time interval that is short compared to the
vibrational period Tvib of the molecule. In a potential
diagram (Fig. 9.63) the electronic transitions between
the two states can be then represented by vertical ar-
rows. This means, that the internuclear distance R is
the same for the starting point and the ﬁnal point of the
transition. Since the momentum p = hν/c of the ab-
sorbed or emitted photon is very small compared to that

of the vibrating nuclei, the momentum p of the nuclei
is conserved during the electronic transition. Also, the
kinetic energy Ekin = p2/2M does not change. From
the energy balance

(9.144)
it follows that the electronic transition takes place at
a nuclear distance R∗where the kinetic energies of the
vibrating nuclei in the upper and lower state are equal,
i.e., E′
kin(R∗) = E′′
kin(R∗). This can be graphically il-
lustrated by the difference potential
U(R) = E′′
pot(R) −E′
pot(R) + E(v′)
(9.145)
introduced by Mulliken (Fig. 9.64). The electron jump
from one electronic state into the other takes place at
such a value R∗, where Mulliken’s difference potential
intersects the horizontal energy line E = E(v′′), where
U(R∗) = E(v′′) .
In the quantum mechanical model, the probability
for a transition v′ ↔v′′ is given by the Franck–Condon

have a similar R-dependence and equilibrium distances

e the FC F for transitions with Δv = 0 are

The larger the shift ΔR = R′
e −R′′
e the larger becomes
the difference Δv for maximum FC F (Fig. 9.63b).
9.6.4 Continuous Spectra
If absorption transitions lead to energies in the upper
electronic state above its dissociation energy, unbound
states are reached with non-quantized energies. The ab-
sorption spectrum then no longer consists of discrete
lines but shows a continuous intensity distribution I(ν).
A similar situation arises, if the energy of the upper
state is above the ionization energy of the molecule,
similarly to atoms (see Sect. 7.6).
In the molecular spectra the ionization continu-
um is, however, superimposed by many discrete lines
Fig. 9.65. Excitation (1) of a bound Rydberg level in the
neutral molecule and (2) of a bound level in the molecular
ion M+

378
9. Diatomic Molecules
that correspond to transitions into higher vibrational-
rotational levels of bound Rydberg states in the neu-
tral electron. Although the electronic energy of these
Rydberg states is still below the ionization limit, the
additional vibrational-rotational energy brings the total
energy above the ionization energy of the non-vibrating
and non-rotating molecule (Fig. 9.65).
Such states can decay by autoionization into a low-
er state of the molecular ion, where part of the kinetic
energy of the vibrating and rotating molecular core is
transferred to the Rydberg electron, which then gains
sufﬁcient energy to leave the molecule (Fig. 9.66). The
situation is similar to that in doubly excited Rydberg
atoms where the energy can be transferred from one ex-
cited electron to the Rydberg electron (see Sect. 6.6.2).
However, while this process in atoms takes place with-
in 10−13–10−15 s, due to the strong electron-electron
interaction, in molecules it is generally very slow (be-
tween 10−6–10−10 s), because the coupling between

In fact, within the adiabatic approximation it would
be zero! The vibrational or rotational autoionization
of molecules represent a breakdown of the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation. The decay of these levels
by autoionization is slow and the lines appear sharp. In
Fig. 9.66 an example of the excitation scheme of au-
toionizing Rydberg levels is shown. The Rydberg levels
are generally excited in a two-step process from the
ground state |g⟩to level |i⟩by absorption of a pho-
ton from a laser and the further excitation |i⟩→|k⟩
by a photon from another laser. The autoionization of
the Rydberg level |k⟩is monitored by observation of
the resultant molecular ions. A section of the autoion-
ization spectrum of the Li2-molecule with sharp lines
and a weak continuous background, caused by direct
photoionization, is shown in Fig. 9.67. The lines have

an asymmetric line proﬁle called a Fano-proﬁle [9.12].
The reason for this asymmetry is an interference effect
between two possible excitation paths to the energy E∗
in the ionization continuum, as illustrated in Fig. 9.68:

2. The direct photoionization from level |i⟩with the

When the frequency of the excitation lasers is
tuned, the phase of the transition matrix element does
not change much for path 2, but much more for path
1, because the frequency is tuned over the narrow res-
onance of a discrete transition. The total transition
probability
Pif = |D1 + D2|2
therefore changes with the frequency of the excitation
laser because the interference is on one side of the res-
onance destructive on the other constructive, resulting
in an asymmetric line proﬁle.
Continuous spectra can also appear in emission, if
a bound upper level is excited that emits ﬂuorescence
into a repulsive lower state. Such a situation is seen in
excimers, which have stable excited upper states but an
unstable ground state (Fig. 9.69). For illustration, the
emission spectrum of an excited state of the NaK alkali
molecule is shown in Fig. 9.70. This state is a mixture
of a singlet and a triplet state, due to strong spin-orbit
coupling. Therefore transitions from this mixed state
into lower singlet as well as triplet states becomes
allowed. While the emission into the stable singlet
ground state X 1Σ shows discrete lines, the emission

on the short wavelength side, a section of discrete lines
terminating at bound vibrational-rotational levels in the
shallow potential well of the a 3Σ state and, on the
long wavelength side, a modulated continuum termi-
nating on energies above the dissociation limit of the

i.e., the square of the overlap integral between the
vibrational wave function of the bound level in the
upper electronic state with the function of the unstable
level in the repulsive potential above the dissociation
energy of the lower state which can be described by
an Airy function. The frequency ν = E′(R) −E′′(R)

on the internuclear distance R because the emission
terminates on the Mulliken potential of the repulsive
lower state (dashed blue curve in Fig. 9.70). The num-
ber q = v′ −1 of nodes in the ﬂuorescence spectrum

For the simpliﬁed model of a rigid diatomic
molecule, the electronic wave functions ψ(r, R)
and the energy eigenvalues E(R) can be approxi-
mately calculated as a function of the internuclear
distance R. The wave functions are written as
a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO
approximation) or of other suitable basis func-
tions.
•
In a rotating and vibrating molecule the kinetic
energy of the nuclei is generally small compared
to the total energy of a molecular state. This al-
lows the separation of the total wave function
ψ(r, R) = χN(R)Φel(r, R) into a product of a nu-
clear wave function χ(R) and an electronic func-
tion Φel(r, R), which depends on the electronic
coordinates r and only contains R as a free param-
eter. This approximation, called the adiabatic or
Born–Oppenheimer approximation, neglects the
coupling between nuclear and electron motion.
The potential equals that of the rigid molecule
and the vibration and rotation takes place in this
potential.
•
Within this approximation the total energy of
a molecular level can be written as the sum E =
Eel + Evib + Erot of electronic, vibrational and
rotational energy. This sum is independent of the
nuclear distance R.
•
The electronic state of a diatomic molecule is
characterized by its symmetry properties, its to-
tal energy E and by the angular momentum and
spin quantum numbers. For one-electron systems
these are the quantum numbers λ = lz/h and
σ = sz/h of the projections lz of the electronic
orbital angular momentum and sz of the spin s
onto the internuclear z-axis. For multi-electron
systems L = Σli, S = Σsi, Λ = Lz/h = Σλi,
and Ms = Σσi = Sz/h. Although the vector L
might depend on R, the projection Lz does not.
•
The potential curves Epot(R) are the sum of mean
kinetic energy ⟨Ekin⟩of the electrons, their po-
tential energy and the potential energy of the
nuclear repulsion. If these potential curves have
a minimum at R = Re, the molecular state is
stable. The molecule vibrates around the equilib-
rium distance Re. If Epot(R) has no minimum,
but monotonically decreases with increasing R the
state is unstable and it dissociates.
•
The vibration of a diatomic molecule can be de-
scribed as the oscillation of one particle with
reduced mass M = MAMB/(MA + MB) in the
potential Epot(R). In the vicinity of Re the po-
tential is nearly parabolic and the vibrations can
be well-approximated by a harmonic oscillator.
The allowed energy eigenvalues, deﬁned by the
vibrational quantum number v, are equidistant
with a separation ΔE = ¯hω. For higher vibra-
tional energies the molecular potential deviates
from a harmonic potential. The distances between
vibrational levels decrease with increasing energy.
A good approximation to the real potential is the
Morse-potential, where ΔEvib decreases linearly
with energy. Each bound electronic state has only
a ﬁnite number of vibrational levels.
•
The rotational energy of a diatomic molecule
Erot = J(J + 1)h2/2I is characterized by the ro-
tational quantum number J and the moment of

Problems
381
inertia I = M R2. Due to the centrifugal force Fc
the distance R increases slightly with J until
Fc is compensated by the restoring force Fr =
−dEpot/dR and the rotational energy becomes
smaller than that of a rigid molecule.
•
The absorption or emission spectra of a diatomic
molecule consists of:
a) Pure rotational transitions within the same vi-
brational level in the microwave region
b) Vibrational-rotational transitions within the
same electronic state in the infrared region
c) Electronic transitions in the visible and
UV region
•
The intensity of a spectral line is proportional to
the product N · |Mik|2 of the population density N
in the absorbing or emitting level and the square
of the matrix element Mik.
•
Homonuclear diatomic molecules have neither
a pure rotational spectrum nor a vibrational-
rotational spectrum. They therefore do not absorb
in the microwave and the mid-infrared region, un-
less transitions between close electronic states fall
into this region.
•
The electronic spectrum consists of a system
of vibrational bands. Each vibrational band in-
cludes many rotational lines. Only rotational tran-
sitions with ΔJ = 0; ±1 are allowed. The in-
tensity of a rotational transition depends on the
Hönl-London factor and those of the different
vibrational bands are determined by the Franck-
Condon factors, which are equal to the square of
the vibrational overlap integral.
•
Continuous absorption spectra arise for transitions
into energy states above the dissociation energy or
above the ionization energy. Continuous emission
spectra are observed for transitions from bound
upper states into a lower state with a repulsive
potential.

10. Polyatomic Molecules
With an increasing number of atoms in a molecule,
the complexity of the molecular structure and the
many possibilities for different isomeric conﬁgura-
tions of these atoms make investigations of polyatomic
molecules a challenging task. Because of the larger
number of degrees of freedom f = 3q −3 for the in-
ternal motions (vibrations and rotations) of the q atoms
in the molecule, the dynamics of such a system of
q nuclei and N = - Zi electrons plays a more impor-
tant role than in diatomics. The potential energy can
no longer be described by a potential curve as in di-
atomics but by an n-dimensional energy surface in an
(n + 1)-dimensional space of the nuclear coordinates.
The dimension n (n = 3q −7 for linear, n = 3q −6
for planar and n = 3q −5 for nonplanar molecules)
depends on the number q ≥3 of atoms.
We will start our discussion with molecules com-
posed of three atoms, where many of the features of
polyatomic molecules are already present but the over-
all complexity is smaller than for larger molecules.
The extension of the methods developed here to larger
molecules is often straight forward. As in the previous
chapter we will begin with a model of rigid molecules
and discuss the electronic states of these molecules, in-
dependent of vibrations and rotations, which will be
treated later in separate sections.
10.1 Electronic States
of Polyatomic Molecules
The molecular orbital model introduced in Sect. 9.3
provides good access to the electronic structure and ge-
ometrical arrangement of polyatomic molecules. The
molecular orbitals are chosen as linear combinations
of atomic orbitals of the atoms forming the molecule.
Since the atomic valence electrons give the main con-
tribution to the chemical bond and the inner atomic
electrons are not signiﬁcantly affected by the formation
of the molecule, the number of atomic orbitals in the
linear combination can be restricted to these valence
orbitals. A measure of the strength of a chemical bond
is the overlap integral

of the atomic orbitals contributing to the binding ener-
gy. This will be illustrated by the following examples.
10.1.1 The H2O Molecule
For the formation of the H2O molecule we have to con-
sider the two 1s orbitals of the two H atoms and the
four valence orbitals 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz of the oxygen
atom, since the two 1s electrons in the inner shell of the
O atom do not contribute much to the binding energy.
The electron conﬁguration of the O atom in the valence
shell is 2s2, 2px, 2py, (2pz)2 (Fig. 10.1a).

10. Polyatomic Molecules
As a ﬁrst approximation only the two unpaired elec-
trons in the 2px and 2py atomic orbitals are used to
form molecular orbitals with the two 1s atomic orbitals
of the two H atoms, where each of the two molecular
orbitals contains one electron from the H atom and one
from the O atom (Fig. 10.1b). This increases the elec-
tron density between the O atom and the two H atoms
and therefore leads to an attraction between the atoms
which implies that the total energy decreases. The over-
lap integral and the binding energy become large. The
two electrons must have opposite spins since they are
in the same molecular orbital.
In this approximation the binding molecular or-
bitals are the linear combinations
Φ1 = c1φ(1sH) + c2φ(2px) ,
(10.2a)
Φ2 = c3φ(1sH) + c4φ(2py) .
(10.2b)
Each of them is occupied with two electrons. Accor-
ding to this model we expect a bent structure of the
H2O with a binding angle of α = 90◦. The experimen-
tal value is α = 105◦. The reason for this (relatively
small) discrepancy is the following:
Due to the interaction between the electrons of the
H atoms and those of the O atom, the electron shell of
the O atom is slightly deformed (see the discussion in
Sect. 9.1.3). Therefore the 2s orbital in the O atom is
no longer spherically symmetric but is better described
by the linear combination (see (Fig. 10.2a))
φh = c21φ(2s) + c12φ(2p) .
(10.3)
This combination of s and p orbitals leads to a shift of
the center of the charge distribution (Fig. 10.2b), which
results in a better overlap of the oxygen atomic wave
function φh with the 1s orbital of the H atom and there-
fore to an increase of the binding energy for each of the
two bonds. Therefore the terms c2φ(2px) and c4φ(2py)
should be replaced by the orbitals (10.3). The optimum
contribution of the p-function in the linear combination
(10.3) can be obtained by varying the coefﬁcients c2i
until the binding energy becomes maximum and the
total energy minimum. The chemical bonds obtained
with such “hybrid orbitals” are no longer orthogonal
to each other. Taking into account all polarization and
exchange effects, the experimental value α = 105◦of
the binding angle can be indeed veriﬁed by a quantum
mechanical calculation (Fig. 10.3).

10.1.2 Hybridization
The deformation of the atomic orbitals by the inter-
action between the atoms of a molecule results in
a spatial distribution of these orbitals that can no longer
be described by a single unperturbed atomic orbital
but needs a linear combination of at least two atom-
ic orbitals. This “mixture” of atomic orbitals is called

Fig. 10.4a,b. sp hybridization of atomic orbitals for the va-
lence electrons of the C atom. (a) 2px, 2py and 2s atomic
orbitals of the O atom (b) The hybrid functions
“hybridization”. We will illustrate this by the exam-
ple of the carbon atom and its combination with other
atoms.
The electron conﬁguration in the electronic ground
state of the C atom is
(1s)2(2s)2(2px)(2py) .
The C atom has two unpaired electrons in the 2px and
2py atomic orbitals. The simple LCAO model would
predict two directional valence bonds of these orbitals
combined with atomic orbitals of atoms attached to the
C atom, with a binding angle α = 90◦(Fig. 10.4a) be-
tween the two valence bonds analogous to the case for
H2O before hybrid orbitals had been introduced.
In many cases it is energetically favorable if also
one of the 2s electrons contributes to the binding, be-
cause the linear combination 2s + 2p of the atomic
orbitals can result (similarly to the case of the H2O
molecule) in a larger overlap with the atomic orbital
of the atom attached to the C atom. If the energy,
necessary to bring one 2s electron into the hybrid
atomic orbital, is overcompensated by the gain in bind-
ing energy (i.e., by the decrease of the total energy)
then the hybridization is favorable for the molecule by
minimizing its total energy.
The combination of s and p atomic orbitals is
called s p hybridization, which we will now discuss.
For the optimum binding to other atoms each carbon
valence orbital should be occupied by one electron.
Since the px and py orbitals are already occupied by
one electron each from the C-atom, only the 2pz-orbital
is free to form the hybrid-orbital. We consider the two
atomic hybrid functions
φ1 = c1φ(s) + c2φ(pz) ,
φ2 = c3φ(s) −c4φ(pz) ,
(10.4)
which can be composed from the 2s and the 2pz atomic
orbitals. The two functions have to be normalized and
they are orthogonal to each other, which means that

φiφk dτel = δik
with
δik =
/
1
for
i = k
0
for
i ̸= k .
(10.5)
Inserting the s p-hybrid orbitals (10.4) into the integral
yields the conditions
c1 = c2 = c3 = c4 =

for the coefﬁcients ci. The two sp-hybrid orbitals then
become

If we assume, that φ(s) and φ(p) can be described by
the hydrogen 2s and 2pz functions (see Table 4.2) the
angular part of φ becomes
φ1,2(ϑ) =
1

,
(10.7)
where ϑ is the angle against the z-axis. This shows
that |φ1|2 becomes maximum for ϑ = 0◦, |φ2|2 for
ϑ = 180◦.
sp hybridization leads to two directional bonds
pointing in opposite directions. This results in the
formation of linear molecules if no other bonds
are present.
Note:
We have here assumed that the angular parts of the s-
and p-atomic orbitals can be superimposed with equal
contributions (c1 = c2), although their radial parts are
different. This is, of course, an approximation, which
can be justiﬁed, because the atomic orbitals are cen-
tred at different atoms and their angular dependence is
considered in the overlap region.

10. Polyatomic Molecules
This spz hybridization gives the C atom two addi-
tional free bonds and, including the px and py orbitals
with their unpaired electrons, altogether four bonds are
available for bonding to other atoms.
For instance, when two O atoms are attached to the
C atom, the largest overlap of atomic orbitals of the
C atom with those of the O atoms is achieved by the
spz hybridization, which yields two strong bonds in op-
posite directions. The CO2 molecule O=C=O should
therefore be linear, which agrees with the experimental
results.
Another example is the acetylene molecule C2H2
where each of the two C atoms has two bonds in op-
posite directions formed by spz hybrid orbitals. One of
the bonds is for an H atom and one is for the other C
atom giving the linear structure H−C≡C−H. The third
bond between the two C atoms is formed by the other
2s electrons of the C-atoms. For the linear molecules
CO2 or C2H2 the 2px and 2py orbitals are not involved
in the bonds along the ±z-axis. The sp-hybridization
includes only the pz-orbital.
For some molecules including a C atom it is ener-
getically more favorable if one of the 2s electrons in the
C atom forms a hybrid function with two p electrons.
For this sp2 hybridization we have to form three atom-
ic hybrid orbitals as linear combinations of 2s, 2px and
2py functions. Analogously to the discussion above on
sp hybridization we obtain for the sp2 hybridization,
when we take into account the normalization and the
orthogonality of the three functions, the three hybrid

Here ϕ is the angle against the positive x-axis

at ϕ = 0 for φ1, ϕ = 120◦for φ2 and ϕ = 240◦(or
−120◦) for φ3.
The sp2 hybridization results in three bonds in di-
rections ϕ = 0◦, 120◦and 240◦from the x-axis,
which are all in the x y-plane.
Finally we will discuss sp3 hybridization, which ex-
plains the structure of the methane molecule CH4. Here
we have to combine the 2s orbital with all three p or-
bitals px, py and pz. The four normalized and orthogo-
nal hybrid functions composed of linear combinations

Inserting the angular parts of these functions, we
obtain for the sp3 hybridization, four hybrid or-
bitals that point into the corners of a tetrahedron
(Fig. 10.6).
Besides the composition of s and p orbitals, hy-
brid orbitals can also be formed by linear combinations
including d orbitals if these orbitals are occupied in
the atoms involved in the molecular binding. They rep-
resent directional bonds, which can result in different
geometrical structures of molecules. For instance, sp2d
hybridization leads to four bonds, all in the same plane,
directed toward the corners of a square. The geometric
structure depends on the number of valence electrons
involved in the hybridization. For example, molecules
AB4 (A, B = arbitrary atoms) with eight valence elec-
trons show a tetrahedral geometry while those with
ten valence electrons form a bipyramidal structure, and
those with 12 valence electrons have a planar quadratic
structure. In Table 10.1 some examples are compiled.
These simple considerations show that it is possi-
ble to predict the geometric structure of many (but not
all!) molecules from the atomic orbitals involved in
the bonds between the atoms. The binding molecular
orbitals are those that maximize the electron densi-
ty between adjacent atoms and give a minimum total
energy.

The basic principle of hybridization is the mini-

of the negative binding energy. This is achieved
by optimization of the overlap integral between
two atoms.

forming a C −C bond is plotted as a function of the
relative share |φ(s)|2/|φ|2 of the φ(s) part of the hybrid
function. The plot shows that for the sp hybridization
the optimum share between φ(s) and φ(p) is 50%. The
hybridization increases the value of the overlap inte-
gral S from S = 0.3 without hybridization (λ = 0) to
S = 0.82 for λ = 1. For sp2 hybridization λ =
√
2,
while for the optimum sp3 hybridization we obtain the
optimum value λ =
√
3.
The energy necessary to lift the s electron into the
hybrid orbital is overcompensated by the increase of
the binding energy.
All molecules in their electronic ground states
have a geometry where the total energy has
a minimum.
10.1.3 The CO2 Molecule
The molecular orbitals of the CO2 molecule are ob-
tained by taking into account the 4 · 3 = 12 atomic
valence orbitals: 2s, 2px, 2py and 2pz for each of the
three atoms (Fig. 10.8). The normalized and orthogo-
nal linear combinations of these 12 atomic orbitals are
12 molecular orbitals with energies En. They are or-
dered with increasing energy and can be occupied by
two electrons in each orbital. Since there are only 16
valence electrons for the ground state of CO2 (four
from the C atom and 6 from each O atom), only the
eight lowest orbitals are ﬁlled with electrons. The coef-
ﬁcients in the linear combinations have to be optimized
in such a way that the overlap of the electron wave-
functions between two atoms becomes maximum and
the total energy of the molecule becomes a minimum.

Fig. 10.8. The unperturbed atomic orbitals for the valence
electrons of O and C atoms
In the C atom the 2s orbital is occupied by two
electrons, and each of the 2px and 2py orbitals have
one electron. In the O atom one 2p orbital has two
electrons and the other two have one electron each.
Without hybridization only two p orbitals of the C
atom and two 2p orbitals for each O atom would be
available. A larger overlap is obtained by sp hybridiza-
tion, where one 2s and one 2p orbital from each of the
three atoms combine to form six atomic hybrid orbitals.
From these atomic hybrid orbitals molecular orbitals
are formed which allow a better overlap of the atom-
ic orbitals of two neighbouring atoms. Calculating the
energies of these molecular hybrid orbitals with opti-
mized coefﬁcients gives the energetic order shown in
Fig. 10.9.
The main contribution to the binding energy comes
from those molecular orbitals that are formed as lin-
ear combinations of the spz hybrid orbitals from the O
atom and the s or pz orbitals from the C atom. Since the
maxima for this molecular orbital are along the z-axis,
they favor a linear conﬁguration of the CO2 molecule.
Atomic orbitals that do not contribute to the binding
(e.g., the orbitals in Fig. 10.8 pointing in the x or y
direction) are called “lone pairs.”

Fig. 10.9. Energetic order of the CO2 molecular orbitals
formed by sp-hybrid atomic orbitals

10.1. Electronic States of Polyatomic Molecules
389
For linear molecules, the electronic states can be
classiﬁed according to the projection Λ¯h = - λi ¯h of
the electronic angular momentum L = -li, analo-
gously to the nomenclature for diatomics. Since for the
four lowest orbitals λ = 0, they are σ orbitals. Their
symmetry with respect to an inversion at the centre of
charge can be “gerade” or “ungerade.” The four lowest
orbitals are then 1σ +
g , 1σ +
u , 2σ +
g , 2σ +
u (see Sect. 9.3).
10.1.4 Walsh Diagrams
The binding angle of triatomic molecules can be esti-
mated from a diagram ﬁrst proposed by Walsh [10.1].
In this diagram the energy dependence E(α) on the
binding angle α is plotted for all occupied molec-
ular orbitals. We will illustrate this for the case of
dihydrides AH2 (A stands for an arbitrary atom). In
Fig. 10.10 the lowest orbitals of AH2 molecules and
their energetic order are shown for the case where A is
an atom of the second period in the periodic system.
Figure 10.11 illustrates the dependence E(α) of the
energy of these orbitals on the binding angle α. The
lowest 1σg orbital is not included in Fig. 10.11 be-
cause it does not contribute to the binding. One can
see that the σg and the σu orbitals have their minimum
energy for α = 180◦, they therefore favor the linear
conﬁguration. The π orbitals, on the other hand, have
their minimum energy for α = 90◦. They tend to a bent
molecule. If the sum - ni Ei(α) of the energies of all
occupied orbitals weighted with the electron occupa-
tion number n = 1 or 2 is calculated, the real binding
angle of the molecule in its ground state is that an-
gle where the sum becomes a minimum. For instance,
in the H2O molecule with eight valence electrons, the
four lowest orbitals are occupied with two electrons
each. The total energy for the ground state of H2O has
a minimum when α = 105◦.
If one of the electrons is excited into a higher unoc-
cupied orbital φk, the angle α can change depending on
the slope of Ek(α). If the energy of the excited orbital
decreases with decreasing angle α, the binding angle
in the excited state becomes smaller than in the ground
state. If it increases, α becomes larger. For instance, if
an electron is removed from the 1πu orbital with the en-
ergy dependence dEπ/dα > 0 the binding angle must
increase. Indeed the molecular ion H2O+ has a binding
angle of α = 110◦compared to 105◦for the neutral
molecule.

Fig. 10.10. Energy levels and orbitals of the AH2 molecule
For the NH2 radical with seven valence electrons
the two σ orbitals 2σg and 1σu and the lowest 1πu
orbital are occupied with two electrons each and the up-
per 1πu orbital with an energy E that does not depend
on α, has only one electron. We therefore expect for
NH2 a binding angle α close to that for H2O. The ex-
perimental value is α = 103.4◦, which is indeed close
to α = 105◦for the H2O molecule.
Similar Walsh diagrams can be constructed for
other triatomic molecules, XY2, where X and Y are ar-
bitrary atoms (Fig. 10.12). Examples are CO2, NO2,
SO2, CS2 and CF2. If the occupied molecular orbitals
and their dependence E(α) are known, such diagrams
can immediately show the molecular geometry, for

10.2 Molecules with more than
Three Atoms
While all triatomic molecules have a planar struc-
ture, the geometry of molecules with more atoms can
be linear, planar or nonplanar, i.e., three-dimensional.
This gives more possibilities for isomers (these are
molecules with the same atoms but different arrange-
ments of these atoms and therefore with different
geometric structure). The geometry depends on the
electronic structure of the molecule and it can be differ-
ent for excited electronic states from that of the ground
state.
For nonlinear molecules there is no electronic an-
gular momentum, because there is no symmetry axis
around which the electrons could precess. Therefore
the electronic states of nonlinear molecules can not be
characterized by a quantum number Λ. They are spec-
iﬁed by possible symmetry operations that bring the
nuclear frame from an initial position into identical po-
sitions. It turns out that all such symmetry operations
form the elements of a symmetry group characteristic
of the speciﬁc molecule. All molecules can be classi-
ﬁed according to their symmetry group and there is
a big advantage in doing so. The mathematical tools
of group theory can be applied to the description of
molecular structure and transitions between molecular
states. This allows the decision to be made whether
a transition is allowed or forbidden without actually
calculating the matrix elements.
The full group theoretical treatment is, however,
beyond the scope of this textbook and the reader is
referred to the literature [10.4, 5, 6].
In the following sections we will illustrate the basic
features of electronic states of polyatomic molecules
and their treatment within the framework of molecular
orbitals and we will illustrate this by some examples.
10.2.1 The NH3 Molecule
The N atom has three unpaired electrons in the three
px, py and pz orbitals (see Fig. 10.13). We there-
fore expect three directed bonds with the 1s orbitals
of the three H atoms, which should be perpendicu-
lar to each other. The overlap between the 1s orbitals
of the H atoms and the atomic orbitals of the N
atom becomes larger when sp-hybrid atomic orbitals
are formed instead of the pure p orbitals of the N

N atom, optimizing the bonding energy of the NH3 molecule
atom. The hybridization enlarges the angles between
the bonds from 90◦to 107.3◦. The structure of the
nonplanar NH3 molecule is that of a pyramid with
an equilateral triangle as basis plane and three trian-
gles as side planes (Fig. 4.14). The asymmetric charge
distribution generates an electric dipole moment p =
5 × 10−30 C m = 1.5 Debye directed along the pyra-
mid axis from the N atom towards the center of the
basis triangle of the three H atoms.
The potential energy E(h) as a function of the
heights h of the N atom above the plane of the three H
atoms has a maximum for h = 0 (Fig. 10.14) and two
minima for h = ±h0, because the N atom can be above
or below the plane of the H atoms. The two mirror
image conﬁgurations are not distinguishable. When the
molecule vibrates (see Sect. 10.3) the N atom can tun-
nel through the potential barrier, where the tunnel fre-
quency is small compared with the vibrational frequen-
cy. This is illustrated by a classical model in Fig. 10.15.
In order to obtain the energy eigenvalues of the
vibrating and tunneling molecule the two nondistin-
guishable conﬁgurations with the N atom above and
below the plane of the H atoms have to be taken into
account. The vibrational wave function ψvib therefore

ψs = N(ψ1 + ψ2) ,
ψa = N(ψ1 −ψ2)
(10.12)
of harmonic oscillator functions, which lead to vibra-
tional sublevels with slightly different energies. The
normalization factor N is chosen such, that

|ψs|2 dτvib =

|ψa|2 dτvib = 1 .
The splitting increases with increasing vibrational en-
ergy but is still small compared to the vibrational
energy.
This inversion splitting of the vibrational levels of
NH3 has become famous, since the ﬁrst maser, devel-
oped in 1955 by C.H. Townes and A.L. Schawlow, was
based on a transition between two inversion levels of
NH3 in the microwave region.
Note:
In the quantum mechanical formalism of the time-
independent Schrödinger equation the wave functions
(10.12) of the two states with well deﬁned energies are
spread out over both sides of the potential in Fig. 10.14.
The classical model in Fig. 10.15 describes the dy-
namical process of the tunnelling N-atom, where the
tunnel frequency is smaller than the vibration frequen-
cy. The classical model has one deﬁciency: It gives
the impression that one can know at which time the

10. Polyatomic Molecules
N-atom is on one side of the plane of the three H-atoms.
This is, however, not possible according to quantum
mechanics.
10.2.2 Formaldehyde
and Other H2AB Molecules
The formaldehyde molecule H2C = O has a planar ge-
ometry in its electronic ground state where all four
atoms are in the yz-plane (Fig. 10.16a). In its ﬁrst ex-
cited state, however, it shows a nonplanar pyramidal
structure, where the two H atoms are above and below
the yz-plane (Fig. 10.16b). The molecule has 12 va-
lence electrons, which occupy the six lowest molecular
orbitals, where the four lowest are σ type orbitals while
the next two are π type orbitals (Fig. 10.16c). One of
these π orbitals contributes to the bonding between the
C and the O atom, the other π orbital is nonbonding. If
an electron is excited from the nonbonding orbital in-
to a higher bonding orbital the bonding energy of this
excited state is larger than in the ground state. The po-
tential energy in the ﬁrst excited state has, similarly to
NH3, two minima separated by a potential barrier. The
two H atoms can tunnel through this barrier with a tun-
nel frequency that is higher than in NH3, because of the
smaller masses of the H atoms compared to that of the
N atom in NH3.

H2AB molecules with A = B.
10.2.3 Aromatic Molecules
and π-Electron Systems
In the foregoing sections we have discussed localized
bonds in molecules. Here the spatial distribution of the
charge of valence electrons contributing to the bond-
ing is restricted to a narrow volume between the two
bonding atoms.
There is an important class of molecules, called
conjugated or aromatic molecules, where delocalized
electrons play an essential role. One example is the bu-
tadiene molecule C4H6 (Fig. 10.17), where alternating
single and double bonds between the C atoms occur.
The electrical conductivity of these molecules along
the direction of the carbon chain is much larger than
in molecules with localized bonds. This hints already
to easily moving delocalized electrons. It turns out
that these delocalized electrons belong to overlapping
atomic p orbitals, which result in molecular π orbitals.
The spatial distribution of the electron charge e|Φ|2 is
determined by the molecular orbital Φ. In Fig. 10.18
the wave functions Φ for the four lowest molecular or-
bitals are schematically shown. The bent chain of the
four C atoms is here approximated as a straight line.
This ﬁgure illustrates again that the energy increases
with the number of nodes of the wave function. The
larger the delocalization of the wave function (i.e. the
smaller the number of nodes) the lower is the energy.
We will now discuss this using the benzene
molecule C6H6 as an example (Fig. 10.19).
Spectroscopic experiments have shown that ben-
zene has a planar structure in its electronic ground state.

Fig. 10.18. Schematic illustration of the π orbitals for the four lowest energy states of butadiene
The six C atoms form a hexagon with bond angles
α = 120◦between the C −C bonds. As has been dis-
cussed in Sect. 10.1.2 this bond angle suggests an sp2
hybridization of the atomic orbitals of the C atoms. We
can therefore conclude that localized σ-type bonding
between neighboring C atoms and between C and H
atoms are present, where one valence electron of the
C atom is involved in each of these bonds. This takes
three electrons from each C atom and one electron from
each H atom (Fig. 10.19a).
There is still one valence electron per C atom left
over in the pz orbital, altogether six electrons that
are not involved in the sp2 hybridization. These pz
orbitals are directed perpendicular to the xy-plane of
the molecule (Fig. 10.19b). They can be used for an-
other bonding type that is not localized. This can be un-
derstood as follows. There are two nondistinguishable
possibilities for how two electrons from neighboring pz
orbitals with opposite spins can contribute to the bond-
ing, which are illustrated in Fig. 10.19c,d. For all six
pz electrons this gives six different combinations. The
total electronic wave function for these pz electrons is
a linear combination

This linear combination spreads the wave function
over all C atoms in the hexagon. We therefore call it
“delocalized.” The delocalized electrons are uniform-
ly spread out around the ring of the C atoms and
they contribute to the stability of the planar structure.

Fig. 10.20. Delocalized π orbitals of the six lowest energy
states of the benzene molecule C6H6
The spatial distribution of the wave functions for the
π-electron system are shown for the six lowest states
of C6H6 in Fig. 10.20.
In a simple model, electrons that have equal prob-
abilities to be found anywhere along an interval L
(in our case L is the circumference of the hexagon)
can be treated like electrons in a potential box (see
Sect. 4.2.4). They have discrete energy levels
En =
n2h2
2meL2 ;
n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,
(10.14)
which are deﬁned by the condition L = nλDB = n ·
h/p and Ekin = p2/2m.
For our benzene molecule example the C −C dis-
tance is 140 pm ⇒L = 6 × 140 pm = 840 pm.
Transitions between energy levels n →n + 1 have
the energy
hν = ΔE = h2(2n + 1)
2meL2
.
(10.15)
Inserting the numerical values for n = 1 gives ΔE =
1 × 10−18 J ⇒ν = 1.5 × 1015 s−1 ⇒λ = 200 nm.
Excitation of the π electrons of benzene therefore
results in absorption bands in the UV region around
λ = 200 nm.
The results of this crude model agree fairly well
with the observed absorption wavelength of λ =
220 nm. The difference stems from the fact that the in-
teraction between the electrons has been neglected in
this model.
The bonding in aromatic molecules is based on
two effects:
Localized bonding between neighboring C atoms
and the C and H atoms, which are brought about
by sp2-hybrid atomic orbitals of the C atoms, and
delocalized π orbitals, which extend along all C
atoms (for benzene, over all six C atoms in the
ring).
10.3 Rotation of Polyatomic Molecules
While for diatomic and linear polyatomic molecules
rotation is only possible around an axis through the
center of mass perpendicular to the molecular symme-
try axis, for nonlinear polyatomic molecules there are
more possibilities. A free three-dimensional rotor can
rotate around any axis ω through the centre of mass S
(Fig. 10.21). The moment of inertia depends on the
orientation of the rotation axis in the molecular coor-
dinate system (x, y, z), which is generally chosen in
such a way that the main symmetry axis of the molecule
coincides with the z-axis.

10.3. Rotation of Polyatomic Molecules
395
Although in principle rotations around arbitrary ax-
es through the center of mass are possible, not all
of these rotations are stable. The rotation axis can
change its orientation against the axes of the molecular
coordinate system and of the laboratory coordinate sys-
tem. However, the total angular momentum J of a free
molecule without external torque is always constant.
The molecule therefore rotates around a momentary
rotational axis ω that nutates around the space ﬁxed
direction of the angular momentum (Fig. 10.22).
Note:
The mutation is sometimes called “torque-free preces-
sion”, while the real precession only occurs when an
external torque acts on the molecule.
The moment of inertia I with respect to the rota-
tion axis depends on the orientation of this axis in the
molecular coordinate system. It can be described by
a tensor. This can be seen for the example of a rigid
rotating body as follows (Fig. 10.21).
The angular momentum Li of a mass element Δmi
with a distance ri from the rotation axis is
Li =Δmi(ri × vi) =Δmi(ri × (ωi × ri)) .
(10.16a)
This can be rearranged to

This vector equation corresponds to the three equations

L y = Iyxωx + Iyyωy + Iyzωz ,
(10.17b)

as can be seen by inserting Iik into (10.17a) and us-
ing the relations r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 and r · ω = xωx +
yωy + zωz. The components Iik can be arranged in
a matrix and (10.17b) can then be written as

⎞
⎠
(10.19a)
or in the abbreviated form as
L = ˜I · ω .
Mathematically ˜I is a tensor. The scalar product of this
tensor with the vector ω gives the vector L.
Plotting 1/√I as a function of the direction against
the coordinate axes gives an ellipsoid with its center at
the origin (Fig. 10.23).
When choosing the axis of the molecular coordi-
nate system in such a way that two of the axes coincide
with the smallest and the largest moment of inertia,
the inertia tensor can be transformed into a diagonal
form. The three terms Ia, Ib, and Ic in the diagonal
are called the principal moments of inertia around
the principal axes a, b and c. If two of these moments
are equal, the system is called a symmetric rotor, if

all three are different, we have an asymmetric rotor.
All rigid bodies with a rotational symmetry axis are
symmetric rotors. For Ia < Ib = Ic the moment of in-
ertia for a rotation around the symmetry axis is smaller
than the other two. We call this a prolate symmetric
top (Fig. 10.23a). For Ic > Ia = Ib we have an oblate
symmetric top (Fig. 10.23b).
Note that the body can rotate around any arbitrary
axis ω through the center of mass (Fig. 10.24).
Fig. 10.24. The three principal axes of inertia for a rigid
rotating body and the momentary rotation axis ω
In Fig. 10.25 the principal axes are shown for the
rotation of the methyl iodide molecule ICH3, which
is a symmetric rotor. The moments around the b- and
c-axis are equal but different from that around the a-
axis, which is the symmetry axis. Both the momentary
rotation axis and the molecular symmetry axis pre-
cess around the space ﬁxed direction of the rotational
angular momentum J (Fig. 10.25b).
Any rotation around an arbitrary rotation axis
through the centre of mass can always be composed
of rotations around the principal axes of the molecule.
If the angular momentum J is written as
J = {Ja, Jb, Jc} = {ωa Ia, ωbIb, ωcIc} .

Since the principal axes are precessing around the

10.3.1 Rotation of Symmetric Top Molecules
The description of the rotation of polyatomic molecules
is greatly simpliﬁed for symmetric top molecules
where two of the principal moments of inertia are
equal. The symmetry axis of the molecule precess-
es around the space ﬁxed rotational momentum J,
unless J and ω coincide with the symmetry axis
(Fig. 10.25b).
We assume the a-axis as the symmetry axis of the
prolate symmetric top. Then Ia ̸= Ib = Ic and (10.21)
can be simpliﬁed to
Erot = J 2

In the quantum mechanical description the angular
momentum and one of its components can be simul-
taneously measured. We choose the symmetry axis as
the quantization axis and as the z-axis of the molecular
coordinate system. We then obtain the eigenvalues

ˆJ 2


ˆJa

(10.23)
where K ¯h is the projection of J onto the symmetry axis
of the symmetric top. The projection quantum num-
ber K can take all (2J + 1) values −J  K  +J.
The rotational energy of a symmetric top molecule is
then

A =

B =

(10.25)
and obtain for the rotational term values Frot =
Erot/hc of the prolate top with A > B = C:
Frot = B J(J + 1) + (A −B)K 2
.
(10.26a)
Different from the case of diatomic molecules we ob-
tain not a single rotational term ladder but a multitude
of ladders, one for each K value. Since J cannot be
smaller than K, each rotational term ladder starts with
a J value Jmin = K.
Note:
1. The rotational energies depend on K 2. Therefore
each rotational level is twofold degenerate except
for K = 0, because terms with +K have the same
energy as those with −K.
2. In the literature the principal axis are labelled in
such a way, that A ≥B ≥C. In this nomenclature
a prolate symmetric top is described by A > B = C
with the a-axis as symmetry axis, while for the
oblate top A = B > C the c-axis is chosen as sym-
metry axis (Fig. 10.23). The rotational term values
of an oblate symmetric top are:
Frot = B · J(J + 1) + (C −B)K 2
.
(10.26b)
The energetic order of the rotational term values
depends on the relative magnitude of the rotational con-
stants A and B. For A > B = C (prolate symmetric
top) the energies for a given value of J increase with in-
creasing K ((10.26a) and Fig. 10.26a). For C < B = A
(oblate symmetric top) they decrease ((10.26b) and
Fig. 10.26b).
Examples for symmetric top molecules are all lin-
ear molecules, such as CO2, NCO or HCN, but also
a large group of planar molecules with a symmetry ax-
is perpendicular to the molecular plane, such as Na3,
and nonplanar molecules with a symmetry axis such as
methyl iodide (Fig. 10.21a).
The intensity of a rotational line in absorption is

The population density N(J, K) of a rotational lev-
els at thermal equilibrium is given by the Boltzmann
distribution
N(J, K) = N
Z gk(2J + 1)e−Erot/kT ,
(10.28)
where N = - N(J, K) is the total population in all
rotational levels and
Z =

(2J + 1) × e−Erot/kT
is the partition function, which acts as a normalization
factor such that - N(J, K) = N, and gk = 2 −δk0 i.e.
gk = 1 for K = 0 and gk = 2 for K ̸= 0.
At room temperature the energy difference ΔE be-
tween two rotational levels is generally small compared
with kT . We can therefore write (10.27) with hν = ΔE
as

sition is proportional to the population density N1
of the absorbing level and to the ratio (ΔE)2/kT .

10.3.2 Asymmetric Rotor Molecules
For most polyatomic molecules, all three rotational
constants are different. There is no symmetry axis for
the deﬁnition of the quantization axis and therefore the
projection K ¯h is not deﬁned. The theoretical treatment
of such molecules is more complicated and exceeds the
level of this textbook.
Often, two of the principal moments of inertia
are not very different and the molecule can be re-
garded as a “near symmetric top.” In such cases the
asymmetric top molecule can be characterized by its
two limiting cases Ia < Ib = Ic ⇒A > B = C (pro-
late symmetric top) and Ic > Ia = Ib ⇒C < A = B
(oblate symmetric top). The projection of the rotation-
al angular momentum J onto the symmetry a-axis of
the prolate top is labeled Ka and that onto the c-axis
of the oblate top by Kc. The rotational level of the
asymmetric top is characterized by the two numbers
Ka and Kc as JKa,Kc. Note, however, that Ka and Kc
are not real quantum numbers, since the correspond-
ing components of the angular momentum vector both
do not commute with the rotational Hamiltonian. For
each rotational quantum number J, several sublevels
(Ka, Kc) exist, where all combinations of Ka and Kc
are allowed for which Ka + Kc  J or  J + 1, de-
pending on the symmetry properties of the rotational
level.
10.4 Vibrations
of Polyatomic Molecules
In a molecule with N atoms each atom has three
degrees of freedom for its motions. The molecule there-
fore has 3N degrees of freedom. The motion of the
center of mass in the three-dimensional space has three
degrees of freedom. Nonlinear molecules have anoth-
er three rotational degrees of freedom for the rotation
around three independent axes. Therefore 3N −6 de-
grees of freedom are left for the molecular vibrations
(for linear molecules 3N −5, because there are only
rotations around two axes perpendicular to the molecu-
lar axis). All vibrations of the molecule can therefore be
composed of 3N −6 (or 3N −5 for linear molecules)
vibrational modes.
10.4.1 Normal Vibrations
If the nuclei of a molecule are removed from their
equilibrium positions, where the potential energy has
a minimum, restoring forces try to bring the nuclei
back to their positions of minimum energy. As long as
the displacements are sufﬁciently small, the potential is
harmonic and the restoring forces are linear functions
of the displacements, resulting in harmonic oscillations
of the nuclei. For sufﬁciently small vibrational am-
plitudes all possible vibrations of a molecule can be
composed as linear combinations of so-called “normal
vibrations.” These are vibrations where all nuclei move
at the same time through their equilibrium position.
They therefore move either in phase or with opposite
phases.
All vibrations of a molecule at rest must have a total
momentum P = 0. Otherwise the center of mass of the
molecule would move and we would have a translation.
Also, the total angular momentum J of the vibrating,
nonrotating molecule must be zero. This leaves for a
nonlinear molecule with N atoms (N −6) degrees of
freedom for vibrations, for a linear molecule N −5,
because have are only rotations around 2 axis perpen-
dicular to the molecular axis possible. The 3N −6
normal vibrations of a nonlinear molecule can be found
by looking for all simultaneous displacements of the
nuclei (in phase or with opposite phases), that fulﬁll
the two conditions P = 0 and J = 0.
In Fig. 10.27 the normal vibrations of a nonlin-
ear and a linear triatomic molecule are illustrated. The
nonlinear molecule has 3N −6 = 9 −6 = 3 normal
vibrations, the linear molecule 3N −5 = 4, where two
of the vibrations (the bending vibrations ν2 in the x and
in the y directions, i.e., in the plane of the ﬁgure and
perpendicular to it) have the same energy because of
the cylindrical symmetry of the potential.
10.4.2 Quantitative Treatment
We will now discuss the normal vibrations of a
molecule more quantitatively.
The 3N coordinates of the N nuclei in the molec-
ular frame are xi, yi, zi (i = 1, 2, . . . N) and their

where we neglect all higher order terms beyond the

If we choose the energy of the minimum of the

With the introduction of mass-weighted coordinates
qi = √mkξi ,
where mk is the mass of the nucleus involved in the
oscillation qi, we obtain from (10.33–10.35) a system
of 3N homogeneous differential equations
¨qi +

j=1
bi jqi = 0 .
(10.36)
This is a coupled system of equations because the co-
efﬁcients bi j couple the motion of the ith nucleus with
that of the jth nucleus. It describes the motions of N
coupled harmonic oscillators with the time dependent
mass-weighted displacements
qi = di cos(ωit + ϕi)
(10.37)

10.4. Vibrations of Polyatomic Molecules

from their equilibrium positions. These oscillators have
the oscillation amplitudes di, the frequencies ωi and
the phases ϕi. Inserting (10.37) into (10.36) gives the
relationship between the frequencies ωi and the po-
tential parameters bi j. Generally the restoring force
for the displacement qi will be affected by the oth-
er displacements qk because the nondiagonal potential
parameters bi j cause couplings between the different
oscillations. Only for certain initial conditions can all
nuclei oscillate with the same frequency and the same
phase. Such selected vibrations of the molecule are
called normal vibrations. They can be obtained in the
following way.
Equation (10.36) can be written as the vector equa-
tion
¨q + ˜B · q = 0 ,
(10.38)
where ˜B = (bi j) is the matrix with the components
bi j and q = {q1, q2, . . . q3N} is the mass-weighted dis-
placement vector of all N nuclei. If ˜B is a diagonal
matrix
˜B = λ · ˜E
with ˜E =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
1 0 0 . . .
0 1
...
1
0

⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠
where ˜E is the diagonal unity matrix, the system of
equations (10.38) would become 3N uncoupled equa-
tions for the displacements qi with the solutions
qi = Ai cos ωt ,
i = 1, 2, . . . 3N ,
(10.39)
where all nuclei move with the same frequency ωi =
√λi and pass through their equilibrium positions qi =
0 at the same time. In order to meet this situation we
have to ﬁnd a coordinate system in which the matrix B
becomes diagonal.
This leads to the equation
˜B · q = λ ˜E · q ⇒

˜B −λ ˜E

q = 0 ,
(10.40)
which has nontrivial solutions only, if the determinant
det | ˜B −λ ˜E| = 0
(10.41)
is zero. For each solution λi of (10.41) one obtains from
(10.40) a set of 3N values qki(t) (k = 1, 2, . . . 3N),
which represent the displacements of all N nuclei as
a function of time. For a given value of k all qki can be
regarded as the components of a vector
Qk = Ak cos(ωkt + ϕk) with ωk =
$
λk ,
(10.42)
which describes the simultaneous mass weighted dis-
placements of all N nuclei for the kth vibrational mode.
The vector Qk is called the normal coordinate of the
kth normal vibration with frequency ωk = √λk.
With these normal coordinates the coupled equa-
tions (10.38) become uncoupled:
¨Qk + ω2
k Qk = 0
(k = 1, 2, 3, . . . 3N) .
(10.43)
The physical reason for this uncoupling is the fact that
for each normal coordinate all nuclei oscillate in phase
with the same frequency, i.e., the whole molecule oscil-
lates on the frequency of one of the normal vibrations.
The mathematical reason is that the potential and kinet-
ic energy written in these normal coordinates become
pure quadratic forms without nondiagonal coupling

The solutions of (10.43) are the normal vibrations

ferent normal vibrations of the molecule can be de-
scribed like vibrations of a linear harmonic oscillator

Fig. 10.29. The vibrational energy levels of the CO2
molecule as linear combinations of the normal vibrations
(ν1, ν2, ν3) with vi vibrational quanta. The Σ levels have
the vibrational angular momentum l = 0, the Π-levels have
l = 1
where dk gives the degree of degeneracy of the kth
normal vibration. For doubly degenerate vibrations
d = 2.
In Fig. 10.29 the vibrational energy levels of the
CO2 molecule and their composition of the three nor-
mal vibrations are illustrated. The nomenclature is
"
ν1, νl
2, ν3
#
, where ν1 is the symmetric stretch vibration,
ν2 is the bending vibration and ν3 is the asymmet-
ric stretch vibration (see Fig. 10.27). The assignment
(1 0 2) means that the vibration is composed of one vi-
brational quantum of ν1, no quantum of the bending
vibration ν2 and two quanta of the asymmetric stretch
vibration ν3.
The degenerate bending vibrations have a pecu-
liarity. They can be composed of two linear bending
vibrations in the xz- and yz-plane, which both have
the same vibrational energy. If these two vibrations
are superimposed with a phase difference of π/2,
the nuclei perform circular motions around the z-axis
(Fig. 10.30). This results in an angular momentum l ¯h
in the z direction, which is called the vibrational an-
gular momentum. The quantum number l is written as
an exponent of the number v2 of vibrational quanta in
z
l·h

Fig. 10.30. Vibrational angular momentum of two degenerate
bending vibrations ν2 with a phase difference π/2
the bending vibration ν2. The nomenclature (1 31 0) in
Fig. 10.29, for instance, means v1 = 1, v2 = 3, l = 1
and v3 = 0.
In the system of normal coordinates the nuclei
perform harmonic oscillations in a parabolic po-
tential, where all nuclei vibrate with the same
frequency and with either the same or the oppo-
site phase.
For sufﬁciently small vibrational amplitudes any
arbitrary vibration of the molecule can be com-
posed of normal vibrations.
For higher vibrational energies the approximation
of the harmonic potential is no longer valid and higher
order terms in the potential expansion (10.32) have to
be taken into account. Now, the total vibrational energy
is no longer the sum of the energies of the normal vibra-
tions, but coupling terms arise, and instead of (10.46)
we obtain

This implies that the displacement of a nucleus dur-

nuclei, and therefore their vibrational energy.
10.4.3 Couplings Between Vibrations
and Rotations
Similar to the situation in diatomic molecules the vi-
brations of polyatomic molecules change the moments

10.5. Spectra of Polyatomic Molecules

of inertia and therefore the rotational constants.
Furthermore the rotations lead to a centrifugal stretch-
ing of the molecule, which changes the mean distances
between the atoms. Like in diatomics the dependence
of the rotational constants on the vibrational quan-
tum numbers can be written in the approximation of
a parabolic potential:

For polyatomic molecules, however, a new coupling
between rotation and vibration can occur, which is
caused by Coriolis forces in the rotating and vibrat-
ing molecule and can mix different normal vibrations.
This is illustrated in Fig. 10.31, where the molecule
rotates around an axis ω in the y direction perpendicu-
lar to the drawing xz-plane. For the symmetric stretch

Fig. 10.31. (a) Coupling of rotation and normal vibration ν1
by Coriolis forces. (b), (c) Coupling between ν2 and ν3
vibrations by Coriolis forces in the rotating molecule
vibration ν1 with velocities ⃗vi of the nuclei the Coriolis
forces try to decrease or increase the rotational ener-
gy, depending on the phase of the vibration. Here we
therefore have a rotational-vibrational coupling. The
Coriolis force can, however, also couple two different
vibrations. For example, if the nuclei perform a bend-
ing vibration ν2 their velocities are directed in the
±x direction. Therefore a Coriolis force
F = 2m(v × ω)
(10.49)
acts in the z direction on the nucleus with mass m and
velocity v. This force moves nuclei 1 and 3 into the
−z direction, nucleus 2 into the +z direction, and there-
fore induces the asymmetric stretch vibration ν3 of the
molecule. The rotation of the molecule therefore cou-
ples via the Coriolis force two normal vibrations. This
coupling also affects the frequency of the bending vi-
bration because the total restoring force including the
Coriolis force has changed.
For the other component of the bending vibrations,
where the velocities of the nuclei are parallel to the
rotational axis, the Coriolis force is zero. This compo-
nent is therefore not affected and its frequency is not
changed.
We see that the molecular rotation lifts the de-
generacy of the two bending vibrational modes. The
degenerate level in the nonrotating molecule splits in-
to two components in the rotating molecule. For more
information on vibrations of polyatomic molecules
see [10.4, 5].
10.5 Spectra of Polyatomic
Molecules
Because of the larger manifold of molecular levels
the spectra of polyatomic molecules are more complex
than those of diatomics. The larger possibilities of cou-
plings between vibrations of the nuclei and motions of
the electrons often cause a breakdown of the Born–
Oppenheimer approximation and the separation of the
total wave function into an electronic part and a nuclear
part is in many cases not possible.
However, the general selection rule still holds
that only those transitions between molecular lev-
els |i⟩and |k⟩are allowed, for which at least one

is different from zero. This means that the integrand has
to be totally symmetric with respect to all symmetry
operations of the molecule in question.
Besides these electric dipole transitions, much
weaker magnetic dipole transitions or electric quadru-
pole transitions are possible, just like in diatomic
molecules.

where Te is the electronic term value at the minimum
of the potential energy, G the vibrational and F the
rotational term values. All transitions between given
vibrational levels in the upper and lower state form
a vibrational band consisting of all allowed rotational
lines in this band. All different bands of an electronic
transition make up a band system. The pure electronic
transition frequency νe = T ′
e −T ′′
e is called the origin
of the band system.
As for diatomic molecules we can again distinguish
between pure rotational spectra (in the microwave
range), vibrational-rotational transitions (in the mid-
infrared) and electronic transitions, ranging from the
near infrared to the far ultraviolet region.
The total dipole moment of the molecule can be
written as the sum of an electronic and a nuclear part
p = pe + pN .
(10.52)
Inserting this into the matrix element (10.50) and
assuming that Mel
ik is independent of the nuclear coor-
dinates we obtain within the adiabatic approximation
ψ = Φel · ψvib · ψrot = Φel · χN
(10.53)

(10.54)
For transitions within the same electronic state, the ﬁrst
summand is zero, because |Φel|2 is totally symmetric
and the integrand in the ﬁrst integral has the symme-
try of the vector pel. The integral over all electronic
coordinates therefore vanishes. We need only to con-
sider the second line in (10.54), which can be written,
because

(10.55)
For electronic transitions between two different elec-
tronic states the ﬁrst line in (10.54) becomes
Mik = Mel
ik × (FCF) × H ,
(10.56)
where FCF is the Franck-Condon factor and H the
Hönl–London factor.
The situation is quite similar to that for diatomic
molecules (see Sect. 9.6). The difference lies in the
larger manifold of vibrational and rotational levels for
polyatomic molecules.
We will ﬁrst discuss transitions between levels
within the same electronic state.
10.5.1 Vibrational Transitions
within the Same Electronic State
These transitions represent the infrared spectrum of the
molecule. Generally the dipole moment of a molecule
depends on the molecular displacements during a vi-

Vibrational transitions of polyatomic molecules
within the same electronic state do not depend
on a possible permanent dipole moment, but on
the change of the dipole moment with the vibra-
tional displacement of the nuclei for the normal
vibration.
In Fig. 10.32 the dependence of the dipole mo-
ment on the normal coordinate Q is shown for the
three normal vibrations of the CO2 molecule. While for
the symmetric stretch vibration ν1 the dipole moment
does not depend on Q, it changes with Q for the other
two normal vibrations. Therefore, infrared absorption
of CO2 is only possible for the ν2 and ν3 normal
vibrations. They are called infrared-active, while ν1 is
infrared-inactive.

Fig. 10.33. Dependence of nuclear dipole moment on the
nuclear displacements for the three normal vibrations of
H2O
The dipole moment vector can not only change its
amount with Q but also its direction with respect to
the molecular axes. This is illustrated in Fig. 10.33 for
the H2O molecule. Here the dipole moment changes its
amount for the ν1 and ν2 vibrations and its direction for
the ν3 vibration. Therefore all three normal vibrations
are infrared-active.
The transitions into the ﬁrst excited vibrational lev-
els (e.g., the transition (0 0 0) →(0 1 0) for CO2), are
called fundamental bands. There are also transitions
possible into higher vibrational levels (e.g., (0 0 0) →
(0 0 3) or (0 3 0)). They are called “overtone transi-
tions,” with transition probabilities that are smaller by
several orders of magnitude than for the fundamental
bands.
It is also possible to excite several vibrational
modes simultaneously (Fig. 10.34), e.g., on the com-
bination transition (0 0 0) →(1 1 3). If the energy of
these higher vibrational states is above 1.6 eV the
absorption wavelengths are below λ = 700 nm and
therefore fall into the visible range.

10. Polyatomic Molecules
Infrared absorption of molecules only occurs on
those vibrational transitions where the electric
dipole moment changes. While the fundamental
transitions fall into the infrared region, overtone
transitions can contribute to the visible absorp-
tion of molecules.
10.5.2 Rotational Structure of Vibrational
Bands
Because of the larger manifold of rotational levels the
rotational structure of polyatomic molecules is more
complex than that of diatomics.
The greatest similarity to diatomic spectra can be
found for linear polyatomic molecules, which can on-
ly rotate around an axis perpendicular to the molecular
axis. They are described like diatomics by a single ro-
tational constant B and the rotational structure of the
spectra is quite analogous to that of diatomics. They
can be regarded as special symmetric tops with the
top axis along the molecular axis, where the projec-
tion quantum number K is always zero, because the
rotational angular momentum is perpendicular to the
top axis, if we neglect the electronic orbital momentum
(see Sect. 9.5.4).
True symmetric top molecules with K ⩾0 have
rotational levels (J, K) that depend on two quantum
numbers J and K (Section 10.3.1).
The selection rules for rotational transitions with-
in a vibrational band depend on the direction of the
transition dipole moment Mik against the symmetric
top axis z. If Mik ≥z only transitions with ΔK = 0 are
allowed (parallel bands) and the selection rules are:
ΔK = 0 , ΔJ = ±1
for K = 0 ,
(10.59)
ΔK = 0
ΔJ = ±1, 0
for K ̸= 0 .
When the transition moment is perpendicular to the
top axis we speak of perpendicular bands with the
selection rules
ΔK = ±1 ,
ΔJ = 0, ±1 .
(10.60)
For molecules with inversion symmetry a further sym-
metry selection rule holds for transitions between two
rotational levels in different vibrational states:
+ ↔−, + ↮+ , −↮−.
(10.61)
The intensity
I(J, K) ∝FCF × HJ K × N × gJ K × e−E(J,K)/kT
(10.62)
of a rotational line depends on the Franck–Condon
factor FCF, the Hönl–London–factor HJ K and the
population density N of the sample molecules at tem-
perature T . The population density of the absorbing
level |J, K⟩is NJ K = N · gJ K · e−E(J,K)/kT with the
statistical weight factor gJ K . The Hönl–London factor,
which gives the relative intensities of rotational lines
within a vibrational band, is slightly different for P,
Q and R lines (see Sect. 9.6.3). For parallel bands with
ΔK = 0 one obtains:
ΔJ = −1
(P-branch)
HK J = J 2 −K 2
J(2J + 1)
(10.63a)
ΔJ = 0
(Q-branch)
HK J =

J(J + 1)
(10.63b)
ΔJ = +1
(R-branch)
HK J = (J + 1)2 −K 2
(J + 1)(2J + 1) .
(10.63c)
Note there are no Q transitions for K = 0.
For perpendicular bands with ΔK = ±1 the Hönl–
London factors are
ΔJ = −1
HK J = (J −1 ∓K)(J ∓K)
J(2J + 1)
(10.64a)
ΔJ = 0
HK J = (J + 1 ± K)(J ∓K)
J(J + 1)
(10.64b)
ΔJ = +1
HK J = (J + 2 ± K)(J + 1 ± K)
(J + 1)(2J + 1)
.
(10.64c)
The spectra of asymmetric tops where each rotation-
al level (J, Ka, Kc) is characterized by the rotational
quantum number J and two indices Ka and Kc follow
selection rules that are mainly based on the symmetry
properties of the rotational levels [10.5, 6, 7, 8].

10.5. Spectra of Polyatomic Molecules

10.5.3 Electronic Transitions
A single vibrational band of transitions between a given
vibrational level in the lower and in the upper elec-
tronic states consists of many sub-bands: For each K
value a rotational P, Q and R branch is possible.
The rotational lines with different K values may over-
lap, resulting in a spectrum with a complex structure
(Fig. 10.35).
The intensity of the different vibrational bands de-
pends, as for diatomic molecules, on the overlap of
the vibrational wave functions in the upper and lower
state. However, the vibrational levels can have differ-
ent symmetries, different from the case of diatomics.
Due to symmetry selection rules only transitions be-
tween those vibrational levels are allowed for which
the integrand in (10.50) is totally symmetric. Since the
ground state (electronic and vibrational ground state) is
generally totally symmetric, the total symmetry of the
upper level, determined by the symmetries of the elec-
tronic state, the vibrational and rotational level must be
the same as that of one of the three components of the
dipole moment.
Only those vibrational bands are allowed for
which the product Φel × ψvib in the upper state
has the same symmetry as one of the components
of the dipole moment.
If the coupling between the electronic wave func-
tion and the vibrational wave function cannot be ne-
glected, the distinction between the vibrational and
electronic part is no longer possible. The energy lev-
els characterized by the product Φel × ψvib are called
vibronic levels (vibrational-electronic levels) [10.9].
This coupling makes electronic transitions allowed,
even if the electronic part of the matrix element is
zero, as long as the product function fulﬁlls the con-
dition that it has the same symmetry as one of the
components of the dipole moment. Such vibronical-
ly allowed electronic transition can be found in many
molecules.
The relative intensities of the rotational transi-
tion follow the same formulas (10.60) as for transi-
tions between rotational-vibrational levels within the
same electronic state. The difference is, however, that

now the electronic part pe of the dipole moment in-
stead of the nuclear part pN is responsible for the
transitions.
The symmetry selection rules for the different
molecules can be derived with the help of group theory,
which will not be discussed here (see [10.6, 7, 8]).
10.6 Clusters
Clusters are aggregates of N atoms or molecules
in a transition regime between molecules and solid
microparticles or liquid droplets. The number N
ranges from N = 3–100 for small clusters to N = 106
for large clusters. Their properties are intermedi-
ate between those of isolated monomers (atoms or
molecules) and those of the bulk solid state. One differ-
ence to molecules is the fact, that they are not found in
appreciable numbers in an equilibrium vapour. Another
difference is the delocalization of their valence elec-
trons like in solid conductors. However, a difference to
solids is the much larger importance of surface effects
and the question arises, how many metal cluster atoms
are necessary to reach the metallic properties of a
solid metal? They can be weakly bound (e.g., the van
der Waals clusters HeN or ArN, (Fig. 10.36), but can
be also strongly bound by valence forces, e.g., silicon
clusters SiN or carbon clusters CN (Fig. 10.37). The

10.6. Clusters

large clusters with 106
atoms have a spherical
geometry, a diameter of about 40 nm and are therefore
still small compared to dust particles or particles in
cigarette smoke. The ratio of surface atoms to bulk
atoms is much larger than in solid microparticles.
Therefore surface effects play on important role.
Clusters represent the transition range from
molecules to solid particles or liquid drops.
The study of their properties can give much informa-
tion on the processes of condensation and evaporation,
or more generally on the physics of phase transi-
tions on a molecular level. Therefore the studies of
clusters have been greatly intensiﬁed in recent years
and nowadays many laboratories are investigating their
properties with different experimental techniques (see
Chap. 11).
We can classify clusters by their constituents in
atomic clusters (e.g., CN) or molecular clusters, such
as (H2O)N. Another classiﬁcation scheme is based on
the binding strength. There are van der Waals clusters
(noble gas clusters), clusters with hydrogen bonding
(for example, (H2O)N (Fig. 10.38)), valence bond clus-
ters such as SiN or CN and clusters with ionic bonds
such as (NaCl)N. The form of the clusters can be nearly
spherical, cubic or rhombohedral. In Fig. 10.39 the cal-
culated structures of (NaCl)N clusters are shown for
increasing cluster size.
The structure of stable clusters is determined by
the total binding energy: Those clusters with a given
number N are most stable which have the maximum
number of bonds between nearest neighbours.
Another classiﬁcation uses the number N of atoms
or molecules in the cluster:
N = 3–12: Microclusters; all atoms are surface atoms
N = 13–100: Small clusters. Quantum effects govern
the characteristics of these clusters.
N = 100–106 : large clusters. The ratio of surface to
bulk atoms decreases with N.
N > 106: Microparticles or liquid droplets. Their
properties approach those of solids or liquids.
For small clusters, most of the atoms are at the
surface. With an increasing number of atoms the
relative
share
of
the
surface
atoms
decreases
(Table 10.2), which implies that the inﬂuence of
surface effects becomes smaller with increasing cluster
size.

10.6.1 Production of Clusters
Clusters can be produced in many ways. The most com-
monly used techniques are the condensation of atoms
or molecules in a supersaturated vapor, or the formation
of clusters during the adiabatic expansion of a super-
sonic jet from a vapor reservoir at high pressure, where
the vapor is mixed with a noble gas, through a small
nozzle into a vacuum chamber (Fig. 10.40). During
the adiabatic expansion the atoms cool down because
their relative kinetic energy is transferred into direc-
tional ﬂow energy. This means that all particles move
with nearly the same velocity and the relative velocity
becomes very small. If two atoms approach each oth-
er during the expansion of the jet, they can recombine
(Fig. 10.41) if their small energy Ekin of relative mo-
tion can be transferred to a third collision partner M,
which can be either a noble gas atom or the wall of
the nozzle. This collision process forms a diatomic
molecule, which can again collide with another atom
to form a triatomic molecule, etc. If the number of

possible cluster-forming collisions during the expan-
sion is sufﬁciently large, this can result in large cluster
sizes.
10.6.2 Physical Properties of Clusters
The cluster size, i.e., the number N can be inferred
from mass spectrometric measurements. The neutral
clusters are injected into the ion source of a mass
spectrometer (Sect. 2.7) and are ionized either by pho-
toionization or by electron impact. The mass selected
cluster ions are detected and their abundance is mea-
sured as a function of N. This mass distribution of
cluster ions, illustrated in Fig. 10.42 for Na+
N cluster
ions, gives the wanted distribution of the neutral cluster
only if the ionization does not result in fragmentation.
Ionization with photons of selected energy hν, which
is only slightly higher than the ionization energy of the
selected cluster, fulﬁlls this condition fairly well.
From Fig. 10.42 it is obvious that the abundance of
Na clusters with certain N values (magic numbers N =
8, 20, 40) is particularly high. This favors the assump-
tion that these cluster sizes are more stable than the
others and has lead to a shell-structure model of clus-
ters where the atoms in a cluster arrange themselves in
shells around the inner atoms in order to form a dense-
ly packed structure. This model seems to be correct for
noble gas clusters. However, for metal clusters, it turns
out that the electron structure of the atomic valence
electrons is responsible for the stability of the clusters
with magic atom numbers. In a “jellium model” of met-
al clusters, where the valence electrons can freely move

10.6. Clusters

trum of Na+
N clusters,

numbers

within the cluster, the electrons can be treated as parti-
cles in a three-dimensional box with the same size as
the cluster. Different from the one-dimensional box in
Sect. 4.2.4 the levels are not only characterized by the
quantum number n, but also by the angular momen-
tum quantum number L. These levels are now ﬁlled
according to the Pauli principle. The highest stability
is reached for completely ﬁlled levels. The experimen-
tally found magic numbers are indeed identical with the
number of valence electrons up to a closed shell, i.e., a
completely ﬁlled level (n, L) in the three-dimensional
potential box, which corroborates the jellium model.
The ionization energy Eion(N) depends on the num-
ber N of atoms but does not show a smooth conver-
gence towards the work function of the bulk metal for
N →∞. It has maxima for certain values of N, again
reﬂecting the shell structure of the electron cloud ac-
cording to the jellium model. The same behavior is
found for the binding energy of clusters (Fig. 10.43).
A very interesting question is the dependence of
the melting temperature of a cluster on the cluster
size. At this temperature the cluster switches from
having a solid-like behavior with a geometrically
well-deﬁned structure to a liquid microdroplet with
spherical size [10.11]. Since the atoms at the surface
of the cluster have a different energy than those inside
the cluster, the fraction NS/N of surface atoms will
certainly inﬂuence the melting temperature.
How can the temperature of a cluster be deter-
mined? One method used for large cold helium clusters
is the following. The He clusters are sent through a gas
of molecules, where some clusters pick up a molecule,
which can either be attached to the cluster surface or
enclosed in the middle of the cluster where it adapts
to the temperature of the cluster. The spectroscopy
of the rotational structure of the molecule allows the
determination of the temperature from the intensity
distribution of the rotational lines [10.12].
It turns out that for some clusters the melting tem-
perature differs from the freezing temperature, i.e., it
makes a difference whether the phase transition is ap-
proached from higher temperatures or from lower ones.
The study of this effect will improve our understanding,
on a microscopic scale, of superheating or supercooling
phenomena, observed for bulk materials such as glass
or water.

Another interesting phenomena is connected with
the photographic process in the emulsion of a pho-
toplate exposed to light, where chemical reactions of
silver halide are responsible for the blackening of the
photoplate. Detailed studies have shown that silver
clusters AgN with N ⩾4 start the nucleation for the
formation of silver halide grains.
The optical properties of metal clusters have re-
ceived much attention because the clusters form an
intermediate range between molecules with transitions
between discrete electronic states and bulk metal with
broad transitions between the valence and the conduc-
tion band. The question of whether broad resonances
in the optical range found for alkali clusters are due
to surface plasmons or are just unresolved absorption
spectra between a dense manifold of discrete states is
still unsettled.
The colorful church windows produced in the mid-
dle age gain their brilliant colors from gold clusters
imbedded in the glass.
10.7 Chemical Reactions
Chemical reactions are based on collisions between
atoms or molecules. In order to understand the dynam-
ics and the energy balance of such a reaction one has
to know the interaction potentials between the reacting
molecules and the bonding energies of reaction part-
ners and reaction products. Therefore spectroscopy is
a very valuable tool for studying chemical reactions on
a molecular level.
We consider the chemical reaction
m · A + n · B →AmBn ,
(10.65)
where m atoms or molecules A react with n partners B
to form the product AmBn. This reaction may proceed
directly or via intermediate steps. Sometimes catalysts
are necessary to start the reaction. Not all molecules A
or their partners B in the gas container where the
reaction takes place may participate in the reaction.
With the concentrations nA and nB of the reaction
partners (number of particles per volume) the reaction
rate (number of reactions per volume and time) of the
reaction (10.65) is
R = kR · nm
A · nn
B .
(10.66)
The factor kR is the reaction constant or rate constant.
The sum m + n of the exponents m and n is called the
order of the reaction, because it gives the number of
reaction partners necessary for the formation of one
molecule of the reaction product.
10.7.1 First Order Reactions
Assume that only one species of molecules A is
present, which can decay into products X when energy
is transferred to A (for instance by photon absorption
or by increasing the temperature of the gas of parti-
cles A, i.e., by increasing the relative kinetic energy of
the colliding species A). The reaction rate
R = −dnA/dt = k(1)
R · nA
(10.67)
is proportional to the concentration nA. This implies
that (10.67) represents a ﬁrst order reaction. The ﬁrst
order reaction constant k(1) has the unit [k(1)] = 1 s−1.
Integration of (10.67) gives (Fig. 10.44)
nA(t) = nA(0) · e−k(1)
R t = nA(0)e−t/τ .

concentration nA has decayed to 1/e of its ini-
tial value nA(0) due to the reaction (10.67), is
independent of the concentration nA.
Examples are the thermal decomposition of mole-
cules with a low dissociation energy, or the photo-
induced dissociation of molecules, such as I2 + hν →
I + I.
10.7.2 Second Order Reactions
Often two equal species A (atoms or molecules) can
recombine to a molecule A2. This can, however, only
happen if the excess energy, due to the kinetic ener-
gy of their relative motion, is taken away by a third
collision partner (Fig. 10.41), which can be another
molecule M (Fig. 10.45) or the wall of the reac-
tion chamber. Otherwise the molecule A2 can not be
stabilized.
The reaction rate is now
R = −dnA
dt
= k(2)
R n2

(10.69)
This is a second order reaction, because the reaction
rate is proportional to the square of the concentration
nA. The dimension of the second order reaction rate

(10.71)
the concentration has decayed to one half of its initial

Note that for a second order reaction the decay

concentration!
Another type of second order reactions is the reac-
tion
A + B →AB
(Fig. 10.45), where two different species A and B are
present in the reaction chamber. Their reaction rate is
given by the equation
dnA

R nAnB .
(10.72)
For equal initial concentrations nA(0) = nB(0) we ob-
tain equations analogous to (10.70) for nA(t) and nB(t).

414
10. Polyatomic Molecules
For nA(0) ̸= nB(0) we can use the substitutions
nA(t) = nA(0) −x(t)
nB(t) = nB(0) −x(t) .
Inserting this into (10.72), integration gives the ratio
nA(t)
nB(t) = nA(0)
nB(0)e−k(2)
R [nB(0)−nA(0)]t .
(10.73)
For nA(0) = nB(0) the ratio does not change with time,
while for nA(0) < nB(0) it decays exponentially with
time, which means that nA(t)/nA(0) decays faster than
nB(t)/nB(0).
10.7.3 Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
When a reaction
AB + CD →AC + BD
proceeds during a collision between the reaction part-
ners, chemical bonds have to be broken (in our exam-
ple the bonds A −B and C −D) and new bonds are
formed.
This can only happen if the electron clouds of the
reaction partners overlap during the collision in order
to rearrange the electron distribution for the formation
of new bonds. The collision partners have to approach
each other sufﬁciently close. This rearrangement of
the electrons needs energy. Therefore, energy must
generally be fed into the colliding system during the
approach of the two reaction partners. This energy may
be supplied by the kinetic energy of the collision part-
ners or by photo excitation. When the reaction products
are formed, energy is released, because the energy of
the molecules AC and BD is smaller than the energy
of the free atoms A, B, C and D by the amount of the
bonding energies of AC and BD.
The reaction can be formally divided into two steps
by introducing the concept of the collision complex. At
ﬁrst the two collision partners AB and CD form with
a rate constant k1 the collision complex K = (ABCD)∗,
which then can decompose with the rate constant k2
into the reaction products AC and BD (Fig. 10.46).
AB + CD →K∗→AC + BD .
(10.74)
The collision complex cannot only decompose into the
end products AC + BD, but can also decay back into
the intial reactants AB + CD. If the reaction probability

for the former is κ, it is (1 −κ) for the latter. The total
reaction rate for the reaction (10.74) is therefore
k+ = κ × k1 × k2
(10.75)
and for the backward reaction AC + BD →K∗→
AB + CD it is
k−= k3 × (1 −κ) × k4 .
(10.76)
where k3 is the rate constant for the reaction AC +
BD →(ABCD)∗and k4 for the decay (ABCD)∗→
AB + CD. Both reactions can be illustrated by a
schematic reaction diagram (Fig. 10.47), where the
potential energy during the reaction is plotted as a func-
tion of the reaction coordinate, which symbolizes the
progress of the reaction over time. During the collision
the distance between the reaction partners at ﬁrst de-
creases and after the formation of the collision complex
it increases again. The reaction coordinate is there-
fore not a geometrical coordinate, but rather represents
a time sequence.

If the energy necessary to form the collision com-
plex is smaller than the energy released by its decay
into the reaction products the reaction is called exother-
mic. Exothermic reactions release more energy to the
surroundings than they need for their initiation. For
endothermic reactions the energy necessary for the for-
mation of the reaction complex is larger than the energy
released at its decay. Endothermic reactions therefore
need net energy fed into the system.
For the two examples shown in Fig. 10.47 a po-
tential barrier has to be overcome during the reaction.
It gives the energy necessary to form the collision
complex. The energy difference ΔE is released to the
surroundings for exothermic reactions and has to be fed
into the system for endothermic reactions.
For exothermic reactions, the energy excess ΔE is
transferred into kinetic energy of the reaction products.
This leads to a temperature increase of the gas in the
reaction chamber. The reaction products can be also in
excited states and can release their excitation energy
by emission of photons or by transferring this energy
during further collisions into kinetic energy.
The inverse reaction of an exothermic reaction must
be endothermic:
AB + CD
exothermic
−−−−−−−→
←−−−−−−−
endothermic
AC + BD .
(10.77)
This implies that the inverse reaction is always pos-
sible, if the reaction partners get sufﬁcient energy to
overcome the reaction barrier.
In a gas at thermal equilibrium, both directions in
Eq. (10.77) are possible. The exothermic reaction has,
however, a higher probability than the inverse endother-
mic reaction. Under stationary conditions in a gas of
reacting molecules there will be an equilibrium con-
centration of reactants and reaction products, which
depends on the temperature of the gas, on the ener-
gy difference ΔE and on the statistical weights of the
particles on the two sides of (10.77).
The equilibrium of forward and backward reaction
is governed by the equilibrium constant
K = k+/k−= [AB] · [C D]/[AC] · [BD]
which depends on the concentrations of the reaction
partners AB and CD and the reaction products AC
and BD.
The goal of the kinetic theory of chemical reac-
tions is the determination of absolute rate constants
for both directions of reactions like (10.77), based on
the properties of reactants and reaction products, such
as bonding energies, interaction potentials and num-
ber of degrees of freedom, that can be activated at
a given temperature. This allows one to calculate the
temperature-dependent ratio of reactants to reaction
products under thermal equilibrium at a temperature T .
10.7.4 Determination
of Absolute Reaction Rates
We will discuss the determination of absolute reaction
rates for two examples.
The most thoroughly measured and calculated reac-
tion is the exchange reaction for collisions of hydrogen
atoms H with molecules H2, according to the scheme
Ha + HbHc (v = 0, 1) →HaHb (v = 0, 1) + Hc .
(10.78a)
In order to be able to distinguish between the atoms
Ha, Hb and Hc in the actual experiment, the iso-
tope deuterium D is used, and the reaction is then
modiﬁed to
D + H2 (v = 0, 1) →HD (v = 0, 1) + H ,
(10.78b)
where the reaction products HD can be readily distin-
guished by their different mass from the H2 molecule.
Since the vibrational energy of the H2 and HD
molecules signiﬁcantly differs for the two isotopomers,
the inﬂuence of vibrational excitation of one reac-
tant on the reaction rate and the probability of inter-
nal energy of the reaction product can be accurately
determined. The relevant energy diagram is shown
in Fig. 10.48. The reaction barrier for the reaction
(10.78b) has a height of 0.12 eV. The vibrational ener-
gy of H2 with Evib(v = 1) = 0.5 eV is much larger than
the barrier. This implies that the reaction probability for
v = 1 should be much larger than for v = 0 [10.13].
The experiments yield reaction coefﬁcients
k(2)
R (H2 (v = 1)) ≥10−5 m3/s
while
k(2)
R (H2 (v = 0)) ≈2.5 × 10−10 m3/s

is about 4 × 104 times smaller. This result agrees with
quantum mechanical calculations.
The second example, taken from [10.14], is the
reaction
CH4 + Cl∗→CH3 + HCl .
(10.79a)
When the chlorine atom Cl approaches the CH4
molecule, one C −H-bond has to be broken in order to
initiate the reaction (10.79a). We will assume that the
other three C −H bonds will not be signiﬁcantly affect-
ed. In the model of the reaction complex the reaction is
written as
CH4 + Cl∗→[CH4Cl]∗=
2
CH3 −H• + Cl•3
→CH3 + HCl ,
(10.79b)
where the star means excited species and the dots on
the H and Cl atoms indicates that the atoms act like
radicals with a free chemical bond.
In order to determine the time-dependent potential
during the reaction we have to calculate the energy
of the complex as a function of the distances be-
tween the three particles CH3, H and Cl. This can be
achieved with the help of ab initio quantum chemi-
cal calculations, discussed in Sect. 9.2. The result of
such calculations is plotted in Fig. 10.49 in a two-
dimensional diagram of equipotential energy curves
Epot(RCH3,H, RH,Cl) = constant, which depend on the
distances RCH3,H between CH3 and H and RH,Cl be-
tween H and Cl. The ordinate of this diagram gives
the distance between the nuclei of the reaction product

10.8 Molecular Dynamics
and Wave Packets
Up to now we have only discussed stationary states
of molecules, where the energies of molecular lev-
els is determined by the stationary wave func-
tions obtained from the time-independent Schrödinger
equation.
Often the situation arises that energy is fed into the
molecule at time t = 0 (for instance, by absorption of
a photon or by electron impact or by a collision with an-
other atom or molecule). The question now is, how and
how fast the energy is redistributed within the molecule

10.8. Molecular Dynamics and Wave Packets

or is given away by emission of photons or by inelastic
collisions. The time dependent fate of the molecule af-
ter its excitation is of great importance for all chemical
reactions (see foregoing section). Molecular dynam-
ics is the essential feature of life. Stationary molecules
cannot induce any processes and the study of the sta-
tionary energy states is mainly of interest because it
is an essential help for the understanding of molecular
dynamics (see Sect. 12.2).
The description of time-dependent processes in
molecules demands time-dependent wave functions as
solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.
We have already discussed in Sect. 3.3 that moving lo-
calized particles have to be described by wave packets
instead of stationary wave functions. This wave packets
best describe the classical movement of particles be-
cause the classical velocity is represented by the group
velocity of the wave packet.
The wave packet description also builds a bridge
between the quantum mechanical and the classical
model for the vibration and rotation of molecules. We
will here discuss this for the example of diatomic
molecules, although it is also applicable to polyatomic
molecules.
If the motion of the vibrating atoms in a molecule
shall be described with sufﬁcient spatial resolution,
the still resolvable time interval Δt must be small
compared to the vibrational period Tvib = 1/νvib of
molecules vibrating with the frequency νvib. Because
of the uncertainty relation
ΔE · Δt ⩾h
(10.80)
we obtain for the minimum still resolvable energy
interval
ΔE ≫h · νvib = ¯hωvib .
(10.81)
This implies that single vibrational levels cannot be
resolved (as in stationary spectroscopy with sufﬁcient
spectral resolution), but only a superposition of neigh-
boring vibrational levels within the energy interval ΔE
which can be described by the wave packet
ψ(x, t) =

between the two turning points R1 and R2. The form of
the wave packet periodically changes during its motion

kinetic energy becomes zero.
This motion of the wave packet can be experimen-
tally monitored by pump and probe experiments using
femtosecond laser pulses (see Sect. 12.2). It can be also
calculated if the potential is known, and with modern
computer programs it can be visualized on a comput-
er screen where the motion can be viewed in a slow
motion version, where the real velocity is slowed down
by a factor of 1014 (also see Table 1 in the Appendix,
where the computer simulation of the motion of a wave
packet in a one-dimensional potential box is shown in
an x-t two-dimensional diagram).

accuracy, the motion of the atoms in vibrating
polyatomic molecules can be visualized and gives
a more vivid impression of the dynamics of vibrating
molecules.
The time-dependent description is in particular im-
portant for electronic processes, such as dissociation
of electronically excited molecules, or the rearrange-
ment of the electron cloud following excitation of
the molecule which can result in structural changes
(isomerization) or in the transfer of electronic into
vibration energy. Such processes play an important
role in biological molecules. One example is the vi-
sual process, where rhodopsin molecules in the retina
of the eye are excited by absorption of photons and
pass through several structural changes within femto-
to pico-seconds. The details of these processes could
be only investigated after the application of ultra short
laser pulses and new spectroscopic techniques such
as time-resolved Raman spectroscopy and pump-and
probe spectroscopy.

•
For polyatomic molecules with q atoms the po-
tential energy Epot(R) as a function of the nuclear
geometry is represented by an (n −1)-dimensio-
nal surface in an (n −1)-dimensional space. For
planar molecules is n = 3q −6, for non-planar
molecules is n = 3q −5. The nuclei vibrate on
this surface and the restoring force for a displace-
ment of the nuclei from the equilibrium position at
the minimum of the surface is given by the slope
grad Epot of the surface.
•
The localized bonding between two atoms of the
molecule is described by the spatial overlap of
atomic valence orbitals. Often the hybridization
(linear combination of atomic orbitals involved
in the chemical bond) increases the bonding en-
ergy. The kind of hybridization determines the
geometrical direction of the localized bonds: sp
hybridization leads to a linear geometry, sp2 leads
to three bonds with angles of 120◦between the
bond directions.
•
For aromatic molecules, delocalized π orbitals are
essential for the bonding and geometrical struc-
ture of the molecules. The energy levels of π
orbitals depend on the spatial extension of the or-
bitals and can be approximately calculated as for
a particle in a potential box.
•
The rotation of nonlinear molecules is possible
around any axis through the center of mass. It can
be described by the space ﬁxed rotational angular
momentum J and the three principal moments of
inertia. The rotation axis is generally not constant
in time but changes its direction in the molecular
frame unless it points into the direction of one of
the principal axes.
•
For a symmetric top, two of the principal mo-
ments of inertia are equal. The rotational energy
of a symmetric top is determined by the two
differing moments of inertia, by the angular mo-
mentum J and its projection K ¯h onto the top
axis.
•
Any vibration of a molecule can be described
as a superposition of some of the (3q −6) nor-
mal vibrations (3q −5 for linear molecules), as
long as the vibrational amplitudes are sufﬁcient-
ly small to stay within the parabolic part of the
potential. The total vibrational energy is the sum
of all vibrational quanta in the normal vibrations
involved.
•
For higher vibrational energies the increasing an-
harmonicity of the potential leads to nonlinear
couplings between the different normal vibrations
and the total vibrational energy is no longer the
sum of the energies of the normal vibrations but
contains coupling terms.
•
The

sist of pure rotational transitions in the mi-
crowave region, vibrational-rotational transitions
within the same electronic state in the mid-
infrared region and electronic transitions in the
range from the near infrared to the ultraviolet
region.
•
Infrared vibrational transitions are allowed if the
nuclear dipole moment p depends on the nu-
clear displacements. Normal vibrations Q where
d p/dQ ̸= 0 are called infrared active, those with
d p/dQ = 0 are infrared inactive. The absorp-
tion probability for infrared inactive transitions
vanishes.

Summary
419
•
The rotational structure of vibrational and of elec-
tronic transitions of linear molecules is similar to
that of diatomic molecules. For symmetric tops it
consists of K subbands. For any given K value
when K ̸= 0 P, Q and R transitions are possible,
for K = 0 no Q-lines appear.
•
Electronic transitions are allowed, if the integrand
of the transition dipole moment is symmetric for
all symmetry operations of the molecule. Often
the wave functions cannot be separated into an
electronic and a nuclear part. The symmetry selec-
tion rule is, however, still valid for the total wave
function.
•
Clusters are aggregates of many like (homonu-
clear)
or
different
(heteronuclear)
atoms
or
molecules. They represent a transition regime
between molecules and solid microparticles or
liquid microdrops. They can be classiﬁed, ac-
cording to their size, into small clusters (N =
3–100), medium-sized clusters (N = 100–1,000)
and large clusters N > 103. They can also be clas-
siﬁed by the type of atoms into noble gas clusters,
metal clusters, covalent atom clusters or molecu-
lar clusters.
With respect to the strength of their bonding we
distinguish between van der Waals clusters, ionic
clusters, covalent clusters and metal clusters with
delocalized electrons.

The order of a chemical reaction is determined by
the number of reactants. The velocity of a reaction
is described by rate constants, which depend on
the potential energy as a function of the reaction
coordinate, and on the kinetic and internal energy
of the reactants.
•
Many reactions show a potential barrier, which
has to be overcome by the reactants in order
for the reaction to happen. Reactions where the
ﬁnal kinetic energy of all reaction products is
larger than the initial energy of the reactants are
called exothermic. If it is smaller the reactions are
endothermic. The energy released in exothermic
reactions is converted into translational energy
and leads to a temperature increase of the reaction
product in the reaction chamber. For endothermic
reactions, energy has to be fed into the system in
order to realize the reaction.
•
For the description of molecular dynamics wave
packets, instead of stationary wave functions,
have to be used. The energy resolution ζE is
restricted by the wanted time resolution ζt ac-
cording to the uncertainty relation

11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic
and Molecular Physics
The goals of all experimental investigations in atomic
and molecular physics are:
1. To gain information about the structure of atoms
and molecules and their mutual interactions.
2. To determine the bonding and ionization energies
and to investigate electric and magnetic moments
and their inﬂuence on the interaction energy
3. To acquire more details about time dependent pro-
cesses in atoms and molecules, i.e., about the
molecular dynamics, which govern all atomic and
molecular processes, such as chemical reactions
and the interactions of photons with matter. They
are the basis for all biological processes and there-
fore for life on earth.
In order to reach these goals, a large variety of dif-
ferent experimental techniques have been developed.
They can be classiﬁed into three categories:
a) Spectroscopic techniques
b) Measurements of collision cross sections
c) Investigations of macroscopic phenomena.
Spectroscopic Techniques. Here the absorption or
emission of electromagnetic radiation by free atoms
or molecules is observed. From measurements of the
wavelengths of spectral lines the energy levels can be
determined. The intensities of spectral lines give in-
formation about transition probabilities, which in turn
depend on the wave functions of the energy levels and
on their symmetries. The knowledge of wavelengths
and intensities allows one to set up a model of the struc-
ture of the molecule and its potential energy surface.
Measurements of ﬁne and hyperﬁne splittings can de-
termine magnetic moments and their interactions and
Stark splittings in external electric ﬁelds give informa-
tion on electric dipole moments.
Couplings between different electronic states or
between vibrational and electronic states cause devi-
ations of the line positions from their expected values,
which are called perturbations. The investigations of
such perturbations give information on the type and
strength of these couplings.
Measurements of collision-induced line broade-
nings and energy transfer by inelastic collisions are
ways to learn about the interaction potential between
the collision partners.
Essential for the power of such spectroscopic mea-
surements are the achievable spectral resolution and the
sensitivity.
In cases where spectroscopy can be applied this
technique represents the most powerful and most ac-
curate of the three categories.
Measurements
of
Collision
Cross
Sections.
Collisions can be also investigated without spec-
troscopic
techniques
by
observing
the
scattered
particles after elastic or inelastic collisions have oc-
curred. Here the integral or differential cross sections
are measured which, similarly to the measurements of
collisional line broadening, give information on the
interaction potential between the collision partners.
Measurements of inelastic collisions allow one to
follow the energy transfer between the partners from
which the internal structure of the partners can often
be inferred. Reactive collisions represent the primary
processes of chemical reactions.
Investigations of Macroscopic Phenomena. The
transport characteristics of molecular gases, such as
diffusion, heat conduction or viscosity, also give in-
formation about the interactions between molecules
or atoms. Here the properties of single molecules are
not directly studied, but are inferred from the average
effects of a large number of molecules (N > 1020). In

11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
the same category belong measurements of relation-
ships between thermodynamic properties (pressure p,
volume V and temperature T ) of real gases, such as
those given by the van der Waals equation or the virial
expansion of the general gas equation (see Sect. 2.2).
Although such macroscopic measurements are easier
and less expensive, the information about molecular
properties are not as detailed as in the former mea-
surement category because the results are averages over
the velocity distribution and over the random orienta-
tions based on a large number of molecules. Details
like the deviation of the molecular shape from spherical
symmetry can therefore only be indirectly inferred.
The information obtained from the different ex-
perimental techniques often supplement each
other. Spectroscopic techniques mainly give in-
formation on bound states of molecules or atoms
not far from the equilibrium geometry. Collision
experiments, on the other hand, probe the long-
range part of the interaction potential.
During recent years, the introduction of laser spec-
troscopy has allowed several novel experimental tech-
niques that combine scattering experiments with spec-
troscopic preparation of the collision partners with
internal state selection and spectroscopic detection of
the scattered particles. This combination gives much
more detailed information than could be obtained from
one of the two methods alone.
Of particular importance for the study of molecu-
lar dynamics was the development of ultrashort laser
pulses that allow the experimenter to follow in real-
time fast relaxation processes, the dissociation of
molecules and the formation of new bonds in chemical
reactions.
In this chapter the most important experimen-
tal techniques, including new developments, are
presented. This should give the reader more detailed in-
formation on the way our knowledge about molecular
structure and dynamics is obtained from experimental
results [11.1, 2].
11.1 Basic Principles
of Spectroscopic Techniques
An important criterion of a spectroscopic techniques is
its sensitivity, which is deﬁned as the minimum number
of photons absorbed during a transition that can be still
detected. This is also a measure of the minimum num-
ber of atoms or molecules that can be still monitored.
The ultimate sensitivity is reached when single atoms
or molecules can be detected.
The sensitivity of absorption spectroscopy can also
be deﬁned by the minimum absorption coefﬁcient α(ν)
that can still be measured.
When an electromagnetic wave with frequency ν
and intensity I0 passes through an absorbing sample,
the transmitted intensity is (Fig. 11.1)
It(ν) = I0e−α(ν)x .
(11.1)
The spectral absorption coefﬁcient α(νik) of a transi-
tion Ek →Ei is determined by the absorption cross
section σik, the difference Nk −Ni of the popula-
tions densities and the ratio gk/gi of the statistical
weights:
α(νki) = [Nk −(gk/gi)Ni]σ(νki) .
(11.2)
The statistical weights g = (2J + 1) give the number
of possible orientations of the total angular momen-
tum J of the levels. The absorption coefﬁcient σik is
related to the Einstein coefﬁcient Bik by
Bki =
c

ν=0
σ(ν) dν ,
(11.3)
where the integration extends over all frequencies, al-
though it is mainly only the interval Δν within the
absorption line proﬁle that contributes to the absorp-
tion.
For small absorptions the exponential function in
(11.1) can be expanded into

The minimum detectable intensity change ΔI main-
ly depends on possible ﬂuctuations of the incident
intensity I0 and on other noise sources such as detector
noise. We summarize all noise contributions to a total
noise ΔInoise. Absorptions ΔI = I0αL < ΔInoise need
special electronic devices to still be detectable. For the
intensity change ΔI the detector gives an output signal
S ∝ΔI, while the noise contributes the amount δS ∝
ΔInoise. A measure for the sensitivity is the achiev-
able signal-to-noise ratio S/δS. From the condition
S ≥δS ⇒ΔI ≥ΔInoise we obtain with (11.2)–(11.4)
the minimum detectable number density of absorbing
molecules as
ΔN ≥
1
σ(νki)L(S/δS)
.
(11.5)
This shows that for a high sensitivity the path length L
should be as long as possible, the signal-to-noise ratio
as large as possible and transitions with a large absorp-
tion cross section should be selected. We will later see
how this demand can be met experimentally.
For all spectroscopic techniques the spectral re-
solving power R plays an essential role. It is deﬁned
as
R = λ/Δλmin ,
(11.6)
where Δλmin is the minimal spectral interval that can
be still resolved, i.e., two spectral lines separated by
Δλ > Δλmin can be recognized as two separated lines.
This minimal interval Δλmin depends on the proﬁle
of the spectral lines. A criterion postulated by Lord
Rayleigh is the following (Fig. 11.2). Two spectral
lines can be regarded as resolved, when the two part-
ly overlapping line proﬁles have a dip between the two
maxima with intensity Imax, which does not exceed
(8/π2)Imax ≈0.8Imax.
The spectral resolving power depends on the spec-

11.2 Spectroscopic Instruments
We will here present two different kinds of spectro-
scopic instruments:
•
Wavelength selectors (monochromators, spectro-
graphs and interferometers)
•
Radiation
detectors
(thermopiles,
photodiodes,
photomultipliers and CCD devices)
11.2.1 Spectrometers
All spectrometers are instruments that allow the spa-
tial dispersion of different wavelengths. This dispersion
can be reached by refracting prisms (prism spectrom-
eter, Fig. 11.3) or by diffraction (grating spectrome-
ters, Fig. 11.4). The incident radiation is focused onto
the entrance slit S1, which is imaged by two lenses
L1 and L2 or by two spherical mirrors M1 and M2 onto
the detection plane. The dispersing element in the par-
allel part of the radiation bundle causes a wavelength-
dependent change ΔΘ = (dΘ/dλ)Δλ of the propaga-
tion direction and thus a shift Δx of the position of
the slit image in the observation plane (Fig. 11.5). The

Fig. 11.5. Angular dispersion dθ/dλ and linear dispersion
dx/dλ of a dispersing element
angular dispersion dΘ/dλ depends on the dispersion of
the prism material or on the separation of the grooves
in a diffraction grating.
With a focal length f2 of L2 or M2 the linear
dispersion of the spectrometer is
dx/dλ = f2dΘ/dλ .
(11.7)
Two spectral lines with wavelengths λ1 and λ2 are
separated in the observation plane by
Δx2 = (dx/dλ)Δλ = f2(dΘ/dλ)Δλ ,
(11.8)
where Δλ = λ1 −λ2.
When an exit slit with variable width δx2 is
mounted in the observation plane, a spectral interval
Δλ = δx2/(dx/dλ)
(11.9)
is transmitted. The central wavelength of this interval
can be tuned by turning the grating in Fig. 11.4 or
by tilting the observation arm behind L2 in Fig. 11.3.
Instead of the exit slit S2 modern spectrometers of-
ten use a CCD array with 500–2000 pixels, a pix-
el width of about δx = 10–20 μm and a total width
D = 10–40 mm. With this device a spectral interval of
Δλ = D/(dx/dλ) can be covered simultaneously with
a spectral resolution δλ = δx/(dx/dλ).
The width δx2 of the slit image is related to the
width δx1 of the entrance slit by
δx2 = ( f2/f1)δx1 .
The minimum resolvable spectral interval
Δλmin = δx2/( f2dΘ/dλ) = δx1/( f1dΘ/dλ)
(11.10)
is generally limited by the width δx1 of the entrance slit
or by the width of one pixel of the CCD array. With
decreasing width δx1 the spectral resolution λ/Δλ
increases. However, this is only true down to a mini-
mum slit width δxmin, where diffraction starts to play
the dominant role. One has to distinguish between two
different effects of diffraction:
1. The diffraction by the limiting aperture a in the
spectrometer (Fig. 11.6) given by the diameter of
the lenses or mirrors or by the grating or prism. This
diffraction leads to a broadening of the image of
the entrance slit. Instead of the geometrical image,
a diffraction pattern is observed with a central
maximum, which has a full width δx2 ≈2 f2λ/a
between the ﬁrst two minima at both sides of the
central maximum. The spectral resolution is not
further increased when the entrance slit width is
decreased below δxmin = 2( f1/f2)δx2 = 2 f1λ/a.
The minimum resolvable spectral interval is then
δλ ≥2(λ/a)/(dΘ/dλ) .
(11.11)
2. The much larger diffraction by the narrow entrance
slit δx1 ≪a. This, however, does not inﬂuence the
spectral resolution, but leads to a decrease of the
transmitted radiation power if the diffraction angle
Δα = λ/δx1 becomes larger than the acceptance
angle α = a/f1 of the instrument (Fig. 11.7).

EXAMPLE
For a spectrometer with f1 = f2 = 1 m and a limiting
aperture with diameter a = 10 cm, the full width of the
central diffraction maximum is δx2 = 20λ. For a wave-
length of λ = 500 nm this would be, without diffrac-
tion, the geometrical image of an entrance slit with
12 μm slit width. The minimum resolvable spectral in-
terval is then, with the condition (dx/dλ) · Δλ > δxmin
according to (11.11), Δλ ≥(10−6/10−1)/(dΘ/dλ).
For an angular dispersion dΘ/dλ = 10−4 nm−1 this
gives the principal lower limit for the resolvable spec-
tral interval Δλ ≥10−1 nm. The resolving power is
then λ/Δλ = 5 × 103.
a) Prism Spectrometer
If a parallel light beam falls under an angle α onto
a prism (Fig. 11.8) it is refracted twice and the deﬂec-
tion angle Θ depends on the index of refraction n on
the angle of incidence α and on the apex angle ε of the
prism. The minimum deﬂection is observed when the
light beam passes the prism parallel to the base g (sym-
metrical case with α1 = α2). From geometrical optics
one can derive for this situation the relation
sin
Θ + ε

= n sin(ε/2) .
(11.12)
because:
θ = 2(α −β)
and
2β = ε ⇒α = Θ+ε

(11.13b)
However, if the size of the prism is the limiting aper-
ture in the spectrometer, it is important for diffraction
effects (Fig. 11.9). With the maximum beam diameter
a = g cos α1, the diffraction-limited resolving power
is, according to (11.11) for ε = 60◦and symmetrical
arrangement,
λ
Δλ = g dn
dλ .
(11.14)
The principal limit for the resolving power is giv-
en by the base length g of the prism and the
dispersion dn/dλ of the prism material.
EXAMPLE
A glass prism with g = 5 cm has for λ = 400 nm
the values n = 1.53 and dn/dλ = 1 × 10−4 nm−1 =
105 m−1. This gives a limit λ/Δλ = 5 × 10−2 ×
105 = 5 × 103.
b) Grating Spectrometers
An optical grating consists of many narrow grooves
(0.5–10 μm width) cut into a glass or fused quartz
plate, which are separated by a distance d (Fig. 11.10a).

Equation (11.15)

11.2. Spectroscopic Instruments
427
The grooves are covered with a reﬂecting layer. Due
to the narrow width of the grooves the reﬂected light
has a diffraction-limited angular distribution around
the geometrical reﬂection angle r, which equals the
incident angle i.
The basic design of a grating spectrometer in shown
in Fig. 11.4. The parallel radiation striking the grat-
ing with an angle α against the normal to the grating
plane is reﬂected by each of the grooves into an angular
cone deﬁned by diffraction. The interference between
the different rays is constructive if the phase difference
between neighboring partial waves is Δϕ = m · 2π.
According to Fig. 11.10b the path difference between
neighboring partial waves is
Δs = d(sin α −sin β)
(11.15a)
for Δϕ = m2π ⇒Δs = mλ.
We therefore obtain, as a condition for constructive
interference of all reﬂected partial waves, the grating
equation
d(sin α ± sin β) = mλ
,
(11.15b)
where the positive sign must be used if the reﬂect-
ed beam is on the same side of the grating normal as
the incident beam and the negative sign if they are on
opposite sides.
EXAMPLE
For d = 1.5 μm, λ = 500 nm, m = 1 and α = 30◦the
reﬂected light is observed at β = 10.6◦.
The angular intensity distribution of the reﬂect-
ed light can be obtained when all interfering partial
waves reﬂected by the different grooves are added with
their appropriate phases. The phase difference between
neighboring beams is
Δϕ = 2π
λ · d(sin α ± sin β) .
(11.16)
If we choose the phase of the partial wave reﬂected
from the ﬁrst groove as φ0 = 0 than the superposition
of all partial amplitudes gives the total amplitude
AR =
√
R
N−1
.
m=0
Ageimφ ,
(11.17)
where R(β) is the reﬂectivity of the grating surface and
Ag is the amplitude of the wave incident on one of the
grooves.
The total intensity I = ε0cARA∗
R is then
IR = I0R sin2(Nφ/2)
sin2(φ/2)
.
(11.18)
This intensity distribution I(φ) is plotted in Fig. 11.11
for two different numbers of grooves N. It consists
of sharp principal maxima for φ = m · 2π and N −2
small side maxima between the two principal maxima
with amplitudes that decrease with increasing N.
Optical gratings have about N = 106–107 grooves.
This implies that for a given angle α of incidence
and a given wavelength λ, the diffracted light is only
reﬂected onto a very narrow angular interval Δβ
around βm.
The intensity proﬁle of the principal maxima
around βm can be obtained as follows.
With β = βm + ε (ε ≪β) we can write
sin(βm + ε) ≈sin βm + ε · cos βm .

with δ = (2πd/λ)ε cos βm ≪1. This is the same inten-
sity distribution as that of an illuminated slit with width
D = N · d.
The ﬁrst minima on both sides of the principal
maximum occur for
Nδ = 2π ⇒ε1,2 = ±λ/(Nd cos βm .
(11.20)
The distribution with the maximum at βm, therefore,
has a full width between the ﬁrst two minima I = 0 on
both sides of βm
Δβ =

.
(11.21)
The angular dispersion for a given angle α is obtained
by taking the derivative of (11.15b).
This gives with dβ/dλ = (dλ/dβ)−1
dβ
dλ =
m
d cos β = sin α ± sin β
λ cos β
,
(11.22)
which illustrates that the angular dispersion is deter-
mined solely by the angles α and β and not by the
number of grooves.
The resolving power can be immediately derived
from (11.22) and the width Δβ in (11.21) of the prin-
cipal diffraction maximum. Since two spectral lines
with wavelengths λ and λ + Δλ are just resolved if
the maximum of I(λ) falls into the ﬁrst minimum of
I(λ + Δλ) (Fig. 11.2), this gives the condition
dβ
dλ · Δλ ≥
λ
Nd cos β
(11.23a)
or
sin α ± sin β
λ cos β
Δλ ≥
λ
Nd cos β .
(11.23b)
This reduces with (11.15) to
λ
Δλ ≥N · m
.
(11.24)
The theoretical resolving power of a diffraction
grating is the product of the interference order m
and the total number N of illuminated grooves.
Since
Nd(sin α ± sin β) = Δsm
is the maximum path difference between the partial
waves reﬂected from the ﬁrst and the nth groove, we
can also write Eq. (11.24) as
λ
Δλ = Δsm
λ
.
(11.25)
The spectral resolution of any spectrometer is
equal to the maximum path difference between
interfering beams in the instrument, measured in
units of the wavelength λ.
EXAMPLE
A grating with a ruled area of 10 × 10 cm2 and 103
grooves per mm allows in second order (m = 2) a spec-
tral resolving power of R = 2 × 105 if all grooves are
illuminated. Two spectral lines at λ = 500 nm, which
are separated by Δλ = 2.5 × 10−3 nm, should be re-
solvable. However, because of diffraction at the lim-
iting aperture a (given by the size of the grating) the
practically achievable resolution is only about 1 × 105.
The linear dispersion dx/dλ is for α = β =
30◦and f1 = f2 = 1 m : dx/dλ = 2 mm/nm. For an
entrance slit width d = 50 μm, a spectral resolution
Δλ = 0.025 nm can be achieved.
Modern grating spectrometers are often developed
without the two mirrors in Fig. 11.4. A concave grating
images the entrance slit onto the detector plane, where
a CCD array monitors a large spectral range simul-
taneously (Fig. 11.12). With an entrance slit width
d = 10 μm matched to the width of one pixel (size
10 × 40 μm2) in the CCD array (size 40 μm × 30 mm)
and a linear dispersion of dx/dλ = 0.2 mm/nm, a spec-
tral resolution of Δλ = 0.05 nm is reached with a si-
multaneous detection of a spectral range of 200 nm. For
more detailled information see [11.3, 4]

11.2.2 Interferometers
Interferometers are based on the interference of two
or more coherent partial waves. The principle of two-
beam interference is illustrated in Fig. 11.13. The wave,
emitted from a source S is split by a beam splitter BS1
into two partial beams that travel different path lengths
s1 and s2 before they are again superimposed at beam
splitter BS2. The total amplitude E = E1 + E2 at P
depends on the phase difference
Δϕ = (2π/λ)(s2 −s1)
(11.26)
and therefore on the path difference Δs = s2 −s1 and
on the wavelength λ.
The total transmitted intensity is
It = cε0|E1 + E2|2 .
(11.27a)
With E1 = E0 cos(ωt + ϕ1) and E2 = E0 cos(ωt +
ϕ2) we obtain for the transmitted intensity, averaged
over a period of the optical wave (because detectors

a) Michelson Interferometer
A possible experimental realization of the two-
beam interference is the Michelson interferometer
(Fig. 11.15), where the incoming parallel beam is split
by a beam splitter into two partial beams, which are
reﬂected by the mirrors M1 and M2 and are again
superimposed at BS before they reach the detector D

11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
in the observation plane B. If M2 is translated by Δx,
the path difference between the two interfering beams
changes by Δs = 2Δx.
If the maxima for the transmitted intensity are
counted for a measured translation L = mλ of mir-
ror M2 the wavelength λ can be determined.
EXAMPLE
For
L = 10 cm and λ = 500 nm the number of
counts
m
is
m = Δs/λ = 2L/λ = 2 × 10−1/(5 ×
10−7) = 4 × 105. If L can be measured within 1 μm
the relative error of the wavelength measurement is
Δλ/λ = 10−5. Generally the length L is measured in-
terferometrically with a known wavelength λR and an
accuracy of 10 nm, which gives a relative uncertainty
of 10−8 for the wavelength determination.
b) Fabry–Perot Interferometer
If many partial waves interfere we speak of multiple-
beam interference. We will illustrate this by interfer-
ence at a plane-parallel glass plate (Fig. 11.16).
If the plane wave
E = A0ei(ωt−kr)
falls onto such a glass plate with an angle α against the
surface normal the wave is split into a reﬂected part
with amplitude
√
R · A0 and a transmitted part with
amplitude A0
√
1 −R. The transmitted part is partly re-
ﬂected at the lower surface and partly transmitted. We
obtain for the amplitudes of the different partial waves
in Fig. 11.16 the following relations:

This gives the general equation for the amplitudes Ai

(11.29a)

In a similar way, one ﬁnds for the intensity of the

(11.34)
These are called Airy formulas. With the abbreviation

(11.36)
The reﬂected and the transmitted intensities depend
on the phase differences Δϕ = 2πΔs/λ and therefore
on the wavelength λ. For Δϕ = 2mπ ⇒Δs = mλ the
transmitted intensity It(2π) = I0 becomes maximum,
i.e., the transmission of the interferometer becomes
100% and the reﬂected intensity is zero. For Δϕ =
(2m + 1)π the transmitted intensity has minima

In Fig. 11.18 the transmittance T = It/I0 is plotted for
different values of the reﬂection coefﬁcient R as a func-
tion of Δϕ. For a given thickness d of the plane-parallel
plate and a given angle α of incidence Δs is ﬁxed and
Δϕ solely depends on λ. The abscissa in Fig. 11.18 can
then also be scaled in units of frequency ν = c/λ. The

The multiple-beam interference is used in the Fabry–
Perot interferometer (FPI) for accurate wavelength
measurements. The technical realization uses either
a plane-parallel plate of fused quartz covered with
reﬂecting layers on both sides (Fig. 11.19a) or two
plates with one reﬂecting and one antireﬂecting layer
that are aligned in such a way that between the re-
ﬂecting surfaces a plane parallel air layer is formed

Fig. 11.19a,b. Two possible realizations of a Fabry–Perot in-
terferometer: (a) solid etalon, (b) air-spaced plane-parallel
reﬂecting surfaces
(Fig. 11.19b). The advantage of the ﬁrst version is that
no further alignment is necessary, but the fabrication
of such a plate with a parallelism of better than λ/100
over the whole surface is expensive. In the second ver-
sion the plate separation and therefore the free spectral
range can be chosen arbitrarily, but the two plates have
to be aligned very carefully.
If the FPI is illuminated with divergent monochro-
matic light, only those angles α are transmitted for
which Δs = 2mπ. Behind the FPI, a system of bright
rings is observed on a dark background (Fig. 11.20).
The diameters of these rings are a measure of the
wavelength λ, and are described as follows.
The angles βm of the transmitted rays inside the
plate with refractive index n are given according
to (11.30) by the condition
mλ = 2nd cos βm ,
(11.39)
where m is the integral order of the interference. If the
inner ring has the order m0 the pth ring has the order

depends on the wavelength λ and the separation d of

(11.44)
A linear ﬁt of the measured values D2
p versus the ring
number p yields a straight line, which intersects the or-
dinate axis at p + ε = 0 and allows the determination
of ε and therefore of λ. If λ changes by one free spec-
tral range the integer m0 changes by one, which cannot
directly be noticed from the ring system.
Note that with a Fabry–Perot interferometer
the wavelength can only be determined modulo
a free spectral range δλ, because two wave-
lengths λ and λ + δλ have the same ring system.
For the unambiguous determination of λ the
wavelength has to be known beforehand within
at least one free spectral range.

EXAMPLE
Assume an FPI as a plane-parallel glass plate with
n = 1.5, d = 1 cm and reﬂectivities R = 0.98 for
both surfaces. We then obtain F = 9800 and a ﬁ-
nesse F∗= 155.5. The free spectral range is δν =
1010 s−1 and the half-width of the transmission peaks
is Δν = δν/F∗= 64 MHz. The spectral resolution
for a wavelength λ = 500 nm ⇒ν = 6 × 1014 s−1 is
ν/Δν = 9 × 106. According to (11.25) it can be
also expressed as the maximum path difference
Δs = F∗· 2nd = 155.5 · 3 = 466 cm in units of the
wavelength λ = 500 nm. This gives λ/Δλ = Δs/λ =
9 × 106, which must, of course, agree with the value
for ν/Δν.
Comparing the spectral resolution of the prism
spectrograph, grating spectrometer and Fabry–Perot in-
terferometer shows that the prism instrument has the
lowest and the FPI the highest spectral resolution.
However, there are also drawbacks for the different
instruments.
While the wavelength determination with a prism
spectrometer is not as accurate but unambiguous, the
grating spectrometer has to know the interference
order m in Eq. (11.15). A spectral line with wave-
length λ1 appears for m = 1 at the same position in
the detector plane as a line with λ2 = λ1/2, measured
in second order with m = 2. Since m can only take
small numbers (usually m = 1 or 2) a broadband spec-
tral ﬁlter in front of the spectrometer can solve this
ambiguity.
For a Fabry–Perot interferometer the interference
order is much higher (for our example above m =
6 × 106 and it is much harder to determine the actual
integer value of m. One has to measure the wavelength
within one free spectral range beforehand using oth-
er instruments in order to determine the absolute value
of m [11.7].
11.2.3 Detectors
The sensitive detection of electromagnetic radiation is
of fundamental importance for spectroscopic measure-
ments. Therefore, the optimum selection of a detector
can be essential for the success of the experiment.
The choice of a detector depends on the wavelength
to be monitored. We will here present only a few
types of detectors with their spectral response and their
time behavior. The following features are important for
choosing the best detector:
•
The spectral response, which determines the wave-
length range the detector can be used for.
•
The absolute sensitivity S(λ) = VS/P, deﬁned as
the ratio of the output signal VS and the incident ra-
diation power P. If the output signal is a voltage
(e.g., for thermo-elements or for photovoltaic de-
vices) the sensitivity S(λ) is expressed in units of
volts per watt. For output currents (e.g., for photo-
multipliers) S(λ) is given in amperes per watt. With
the sensitive area A of the detector, the power re-
ceived by the detector can be written as the product
P = A · I, where I is the incident intensity.
•
The noise ﬁgure of the detector, expressed by the
noise equivalent input power NEP, means an inci-
dent radiation power that generates the same output
signal as the detector noise itself. Although the
signal-to-noise ratio S/N is in most cases limited

434
11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
by the noise of the incident radiation, the detector
noise might further reduce it [11.8, 9].
a) Thermal Detectors
Thermal detectors measure the input power of the inci-
dent radiation independent of the wavelength λ. They
can therefore be used within the whole spectral range
from microwaves to UV radiation. The absorbed ra-
diation power results in an increase of the detector
temperature, which depends on the heat capacity H
and the heat conductivity G for heat transfer from
the detector to the surroundings. All characteristic fea-
tures of the detector that depend on its temperature
can be used for monitoring the incident radiation pow-
er. In most cases the temperature-dependent electrical
conductivity is utilized as a monitor [11.10].
If the fraction β of the incident radiation power P
is absorbed by the detector, its temperature increase is
determined from the energy balance
β P = H dT
t
+ G(T −TS) ,
(11.49)
where TS is the temperature of the surroundings.
If the time-independent incident power P0 is
switched on at time t = 0, the integration of (11.49)
gives
T = TS + β P0
G

1 −e−(G/H)t
.
(11.50)
The temperature rises from the initial value TS at
t = 0 to the temperature T = TS + ΔT for t = ∞
(Fig. 11.21). The temperature rise
ΔT = β P0
G
(11.51)
is inversely proportional to the thermal losses G and
does not depend on the heat capacity H.
Fig. 11.21. Thermal detector and its temperature T when at
t = 0 a constant power β P0 is absorbed by the detector
Small values of G make the detector sensitive, but
also slow.
With time-dependent radiation power
P = P0(1 + a cos Ωt)
|a| ≤1
one obtains from (11.49) a detector temperature
T (Ω) = TS + ΔT (1 + cos(Ωt + φ)
(11.52)
that depends on the modulation frequency Ω and which
has a phase lag φ against the phase of the radiation
determined by
tan φ = Ω H/G .
(11.53)
The modulation amplitude
ΔT =
aβ P0G
√
G2 + Ω2H2
(11.54)
decreases with Ω. At the frequency Ωg = G/H the
amplitude ΔT has dropped by a factor of √2 from its
DC value for Ω = 0.
We deﬁne as the time constant of the detector the
value
τ = 1/Ωg = H/G .
(11.55)
A fast and sensitive detector should have a small heat
capacity H and a small heat conductivity G.
In Fig. 11.22 some thermal detectors are shown.
The ﬁrst one is a thermopile that consists of many
thermo-elements in a series, where one end is in ther-
mal contact with the backside of a thin metal sheet and
the other is connected to a heat sink kept at constant
temperature. If the radiation is incident on the black-
ened surface of the sheet, its temperature rises and the
temperature difference to the heat sink is monitored by
the thermo-elements. The output signal equals the sum
of the thermovoltages of the different thermocouples.
The second example in Fig. 11.22b is a bolometer,
where the voltage U = RI across the bolometer with
electrical resistance R is measured when a constant
current I is sent through it.
The temperature change ΔT of the bolometer in-
duced by the absorbed incident radiation causes a re-
sistance change
ΔR = (dR/dT )ΔT
(11.56)
and therefore an output signal
ΔU = IΔR .

Inserting (11.51) gives the relation between the ab-
sorbed radiation energy β · P0 and the output signal
ΔU:
ΔU = I(dR/dT )β P0/G .
(11.57)
The sensitivity of the bolometer depends on the deriva-
tive dR/dT , which becomes very large for semi-
conductor materials at low temperatures, where the
electrical resistance R decreases very steeply with
increasing T . Therefore, sensitive bolometers are gen-
erally made of doped semiconductors and are used at
temperatures below 4 K.
EXAMPLE
At T = 1.5 K the electric resistance of a doped silicon
semiconductor bolometer is R = 10 k'. With a cur-
rent of 100 μA the voltage across the bolometer is
U = 1 V. The derivative dR/dT at T = 1.5 K is about
10−4 V/K. With β = 0.9 and G = 10−15 W/K a radia-
tion power of P0 = 10−12 W generates an output signal
ΔU = 10−5 V = 10 μV. This is readily detectable be-
cause the detector noise at these low temperatures is
below this value [11.11].
A particularly large derivative dR/dT is obtained
at the critical temperature of superconductivity, where
the system jumps within a very narrow interval ΔT
from the normal to the superconducting state. If the de-
vice can be maintained at this temperature by feedback
control, the incident radiation power can be inferred
from the feedback control signal.
b) Photodiodes
Photodiodes are doped semiconductor radiation detec-
tors that can be used either as photoconductive or as
photovoltaic devices. When the semiconductor diode is
irradiated, electrons are excited from the valence into
the conduction band (Fig. 11.23). This produces free
charge carriers and increases the conductivity of the
diode. If an external voltage is applied in the forward
direction, the electrical resistance R of the diode de-
creases and with it the voltage drop across the diode.
The output signal is
ΔU = IΔR = aP0 .
(11.58)
These photoconductive devices require an external
voltage U0.

Fig. 11.24a–c. Photovoltaic semiconductor detector. (a) Schematic structure, (b) band energies around the p-n junction
without illumination, (c) with illumination
The photovoltaic semiconductor detectors on the
other hand generate the output voltage without an exter-
nal supply. They are based on the following principle,
which is illustrated in Fig. 11.24.
In the non-illuminated p-n junction of the diode, the
diffusion of the electrons from the n-region into the
p-region and of the holes into the opposite direction
produces a charge separation and therefore a diffusion
voltage VD across the junction. This diffusion voltage
cannot be detected by an external voltmeter because it
is just compensated by the opposite contact potentials
between the connections to the voltmeter and the n- or
p-part at both end faces of the diode.
If the p-n junction is illuminated, electron-hole
pairs are created by photon absorption. The electrons
are driven by the diffusion voltage into the n-region
and the holes into the p-region. This leads to a de-
crease ΔVD of the diffusion voltage, which appears as
the photovoltage
Vphoto = ΔVD
(11.59a)
across the open electrodes of the diode.
If these electrodes are connected through an am-
peremeter, the photocurrent
iphoto = −ηeφA
(11.59b)
is measured. Here η is the quantum efﬁciency of the
detector, φ = I0/hν the incident photon ﬂux densi-
ty (number of photons per cm2 per s) and A is the
sensitive area of the detector.

The illuminated p-n photodetector can be used ei-
ther as a photocurrent generator or as a voltage source,
depending on the external resistor R between the elec-
trodes. The output voltage can, however, never exceed
the diffusion voltage VD (Fig. 11.25).
c) Photomultipliers
Photomultipliers are very sensitive detectors for low-
level radiation from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet
region. They consist of a photocathode and a number

11.3. Microwave Spectroscopy
437
of amplifying dynodes in an evacuated glass cylin-
der (Fig. 2.42). The spectral response depends on the
materials used for the photocathode. Some spectral
sensitivity curves of typical photocathodes are shown
in Fig. 11.26.
The photoelectrons, generated under illumination
of the photocathode with an efﬁciency η = ne/nph, are
accelerated and focused by a voltage of around 100 V
between the cathode and the ﬁrst dynode onto the ﬁrst
dynode with a copper beryllium surface. Here they pro-
duce, by electron impact, secondary electrons, which
are again accelerated to the second dynode. If each
electron impinging onto a dynode generates q > 1 sec-
ondary electrons, one photoelectron produces at the
Nth dynode an electron avalanche of q N electrons,
which are imaged onto the anode. Here the electron
avalanche pulse, induced by a single photoelectron,
charges the output capacitance C up to a voltage Vout =
q Ne/C.

cathodes and quantum efﬁciency lines η = ne/h · ν =

In the case of continuous illumination one obtains
a continuous photocurrent. For n photons/s impinging
on the photocathode with a quantum efﬁciency η, the
photocurrent emitted by the cathode is nphotηe and the
anode current is ia = nphotηeq N. Across the resistor R
between the anode and ground, a dc voltage V = Ria
is measured [11.12].
EXAMPLE
With a quantum efﬁciency η = 0.2 of the photocath-
ode and the ampliﬁcation factor q = 4 the photocurrent
at the anode of a photomultiplier with N = 10 dyn-
odes is ia = nphot · 0.2 · 1.6 × 10−19 · 410 A. With illu-
minating radiation λ = 500 nm and P0 = 10−15 W ⇒
nphot = 6500/s we obtain a photocurrent emitted from
the cathode of ic = 6500 · η · e/s = 2.1 × 10−16 A and
at the anode of ia = 2.1 × 10−10 A.
A single photoelectron generates an electron pulse
with the charge Q = e · 410 = 1.7 × 10−13 C. With
a capacitance of 10 pF at the photomultiplier output,
this gives a voltage pulse of U = Q/C = 17 mV.
11.3 Microwave Spectroscopy
Transitions between molecular rotational levels in the
same vibrational state fall into the microwave range.
Accurate measurement of rotational absorption lines
allows the determination of the moments of inertia
and therefore of the geometry of the molecule. Also,
transitions between atomic or molecular hyperﬁne lev-
els or Stark splittings can be induced by microwaves,
which gives information on nuclear spins and electric
or magnetic moments of molecules.
Microwave spectroscopy is the most accurate
method for the determination of molecular structure in
the electronic ground state or for measuring electric and
magnetic dipole moments.
For polyatomic molecules, the microwave spec-
trum generally consists of many lines and it is not
always straight forward to assign all lines unambigu-
ously to the correct transitions. Here, the substitution
of one or more atoms in the molecule by their iso-
topes is helpful and the comparison of the microwave
spectra of different isotopomers generally allows the

438
11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
unambiguous determination of the rotational constants
and the molecular structure [11.13].
A possible experimental arrangement for micro-
wave absorption spectroscopy is shown in Fig. 11.27.
Microwaves are generated by microwave oscillators
(klystron, carcinotron or gun oscillator), are focused
by a Teﬂon lens transparent to microwaves, and are
sent through a long microwave guide that contains the
absorbing gas at the temperature T .

cient
α(νki) = Nk

1 −e−ΔE/kT 
σ(νki) .
(11.61)
At room temperature T = 300 K the thermal energy kT
is much larger than the photon energy hν = ΔE.
For example, for ν = 3 GHz, hν = 2 × 10−24 J,
while for T = 300 K, kT = 4 × 10−21 J, i.e., 2000
times larger. Therefore, hν/kT ≪1 and we can ex-
pand the exponential to obtain
α(νki) ≈Nk(ΔE/kT )σ(νki)
(11.62)
= Nk(hν/kT )σ(νki) .
Although the density of molecules in the absorbing lev-
el might be large, the difference between the lower and
upper state population is small and therefore the ab-
sorption rate is only slightly larger than the stimulated
emission rate. The net absorption can be expressed by
an effective density Neff of absorbing molecules, which
Fig. 11.27. Possible experimental arrangement for mi-
crowave spectroscopy in a Stark-cell where the voltage of
the central electrode against the outer electrodes at ground
potential is modulated
is smaller than the real number density Nk by a factor
hν/kT , i.e., Neff = Nk(hν/kT).
EXAMPLE
At a gas pressure of 10 mbar the total molecu-
lar density N = - Ni at T = 300 K is about N =
3 × 1023/m3. The population distributes over many
rotational-vibrational levels. We assume that 1% of all
molecules are in the absorbing level with energy Ek
and that the ratio hν/kT is about 10−3. The effec-
tive net absorption coefﬁcient then becomes α = 3 ×
1018σ(νik)m2/m3. With the absorption cross section
σ = 10−23 m2 the relative absorption for 1m absorp-
tion path length becomes ΔI/I0 = 3 × 10−5. In order
to detect this small absorption the ﬂuctuations of the
microwave intensity I0 should not be larger than this
value.
The sensitivity can be greatly enhanced by frequen-
cy modulation of the microwave. The frequency of the
incident wave with intensity
I(t) = I0 cos2[2πνm(1 + a cos(2π f t)t]
(11.63)
oscillates around the central frequency νm. When νm is
tuned across an absorption line, the absorption coefﬁ-
cient α(ν) and therefore the detected signal are modu-
lated at the frequency f (Fig. 11.28). The transmitted
intensity can be expanded into the Taylor series
It(ν) = It(νm) +

(11.64)
If the phase-sensitive detector (lock-in ampliﬁer) on-

frequency f , the detected signal
It(νm) −It(ν) = ΔIt = −a · νm ·
dIt



cos(2π f t)
(11.65)
is proportional to the ﬁrst derivative dIt/dν of the
transmitted intensity and to the modulation index a.
The ﬂuctuations of the incident microwave intensi-
ty I0 are generally distributed over a broad frequency
range, depending on the kind of noise, inﬂuencing I0.
The phase sensitive detector suppresses most of the

radiation. (b) Derivative dα/dν of the absorption coefﬁcient
noise because it only transmits the contributions within
a small frequency interval δν around the frequency f .
The width δν = 1/τ depends on the time constant τ of
the detector. This can also be illustrated in the follow-
ing way. The detector always measures the difference
ΔIt( f ) = (I0 −It)| f at the frequency f . If I0 ﬂuctu-
ates so too does It. Because generally (I0 −It) ≪I0,
the ﬂuctuations are mostly cancelled by measuring the
difference ΔI.
Instead of modulating the microwave frequency, the
absorption frequency can be modulated, which has the
same effect on the reduction of noise. This absorption
modulation can be achieved by an external ac electric
ﬁeld, which causes a Stark shift of the molecular levels
(if the molecule possesses an electric dipole moment)
The shift depends on the rotational quantum number J
and is therefore different for the two levels ⟨J| and
⟨J + 1| of a rotational transition J →J + 1. The fre-
quency ν0 of the transition is shifted and split into the
different Stark components.
The electric ﬁeld is generated between two long
parallel electrodes in the absorption cell (Fig. 11.27),
which are separated by the distance d and are charged
to the voltages +U0 and −U0. With U0 = 10 kV and
d = 4 mm the electric ﬁeld is E = 25 kV/cm. Another

site directions in the upper and lower half of the
cell (Fig. 11.29).
To illustrate the high spectral resolution, a sec-
tion of the microwave absorption spectrum of the
CO molecule is shown in Fig. 11.30. As was out-
lined in Sect. 9.5, the frequencies of the rotational
lines increases linearly with the rotational quantum
number J and the lines are therefore equidistant.
The frequency difference depends on the rotational
constant and differs for the two isotopomers 12CO
und 13CO.

11.4 Infrared Spectroscopy
The vibrational-rotational transitions of most molec-
ules, and also many electronic transitions between
excited electronic states of atoms and molecules, fall
into the infrared spectral region. Since the vibrational
bands are characteristic for each molecule, this spectral
range is also called the ﬁngerprint region of molecular
spectroscopy [11.14, 15].
Several different techniques have been developed
for accurate and sensitive infrared spectroscopy. They
can also be used in the visible and UV region.
11.4.1 Infrared Spectrometers
In Fig. 11.31 the basic experimental setup is shown for
classical infrared absorption spectroscopy. The radia-
tion source is a high-pressure mercury lamp or a hot
tungsten pin. Both sources emit a spectral continuum,
where the hot tungsten pin (globar) with a temperature
T emits the continuous blackbody thermal radiation
with a maximum at λmax ∝1/T (see Sect. 3.1). For
T = 1,000 K the maximum of the intensity distribution
is at λmax = 3 μm. The radiation is collimated by the
mirror M1 and is sent as a parallel beam through the ab-
sorption cell with length L, before it is focused by M2
onto the entrance slit of a spectrometer, which disperses
the spectral continuum and transmits the desired wave-
lengths. A detector behind the spectrometer monitors
the transmitted intensity It(ν). The spectral resolution
is limited by the resolving power of the spectrometer.

Fig. 11.31. Classical infrared spectrometer with reference,
rotating segmented mirror and lock-in detection
To increase the sensitivity, a difference method is
used: A rotating segmented mirror sends the parallel
beam alternately through the sample cell and through
an identical reference cell, which is, however, empty.
The difference
ΔI(ν) = IR −It(ν) = α(ν) · L · I0
(11.66a)
between the reference intensity IR and the intensity It
of the signal beam transmitted through the absorption
cell is measured.
Dividing the measured signal ΔI(ν) by the incident
intensity I0 gives
ΔI/I0 = α(ν) · L ,
(11.66b)
which shows that for the detection of the relative ab-
sorption by measuring the ratio ΔI/I0, the ﬂuctuations
of the incident intensity I0 are eliminated.
11.4.2 Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
Fourier transform spectroscopy has many advantages
compared to conventional absorption spectroscopy. It is
based on interferometry with a Michelson interferome-
ter (Sect. 11.2.2), where the path length L2 of one of the
arms is continuously and uniformly changed by mirror
M2 moving with constant speed v (Fig. 11.15). Assume
the radiation source emits a monochromatic wave with
amplitude
E(ω) = A0 cos ω0t

(11.67)
The two interfering partial beams have the amplitudes
Ai =
√
RT A0 ,
where R and T are the reﬂectivity and transmittance of
the beam splitter BS. Because of the different optical
path lengths s1 and s2, the interference intensity at the
detector plane

depends on the path difference Δs = s1 −s2.
The detector can not follow the fast optical os-
cillations with frequency ω0. The detector signal is
therefore proportional to the time average ⟨I(t)⟩.
With ⟨cos ω0t⟩= 0 and

(11.69)
Instead of the frequency ω0, the detector measures the
much lower frequency Ω = ω0v/c for the transmit-
ted intensity averaged over the time constant τ of the
detector.
In the Michelson interferometer, with one mir-
ror uniformly moving with velocity v, the optical
frequency ω0 of the radiation source it trans-
formed to the much smaller frequency ω0v/c of
the output signal.

Mathematically, the spectrum I(ω) of the ra-
diation source can be obtained through a Fourier
transformation of the measured signal S(t) ∝⟨I(t)⟩,

as can be proved by inserting (11.69) into the integral.
If the radiation source emits two frequencies ω1 and
ω2, the two partial beams with frequency ω1 and the
two beams with ω2 interfere with each other indepen-
dently. The interference between ω1 and ω2 averages
to zero, because the phase difference between two
beams with different frequencies periodically changes
between 0 and 2π. If the detector time constant τ is
larger than 2π/(ω1 −ω2) it cannot follow these rapid
changes. The measured intensity averaged over a time
period τ is then
⟨It(t)⟩= ⟨I1⟩+ ⟨I2⟩.

The interferogram is simply the superposition of the
interferograms of two monochromatic waves with fre-
quencies ω1 and ω2. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.32b)
for the case of equal amplitudes of the two waves.

From Fig. 11.32b we can obtain a vivid illustration of
the spectral resolving power of Fourier spectroscopy.
In order to ﬁnd the frequencies ω1 and ω2 from the
measured signal S(t), the path s2(t) = vt traveled by
the moving mirror during the measurement has to be
sufﬁciently large to include at least one beat period
T = (2πc/v)/(ω1 −ω2). The minimum frequency in-
terval δω = (ω1 −ω2) is related to the minimum time
Δt = Δs/v for the measurement by
v
t δω ≥2π
Δt ⇒δω ≥2πc
Δs .
(11.73a)
This can be stated in other words. The minimum path
difference Δs = vΔt between the two interfering par-
tial waves, measured in units of the wavelength λ
gives the resolving power ω/δω of the interferometer,
because
ω
δω = 2πν
δω = 2πcΔs

(11.73b)
If the radiation source emits radiation on many fre-
quencies, the detector signal S(t) becomes more com-
plicated [11.16]. In any case, however, the relation

Mathematically, the Fourier transform requires that
the limits of the integral extend from 0 to ∞.
Experimentally only a ﬁnite maximum value Δsmax can
be realized, depending on the construction of the inter-
ferometer. This deﬁciency can be taken into account
by introducing a gate function G(t), which is multi-
plied with the signal S(t). This can be, for instance,
a rectangular function
G(t) =
/
1 for 0 ≤t ≤tmax
0 for t > tmax
with tmax = Δsmax/v .
The spectrum of the source is now expressed by the

(11.75)
The Fourier transform of a rectangular function f (x) is
(analogously to the diffraction-limited intensity, trans-
mitted through a rectangular slit) given by the function
(sin x/x)2, which has a principal maximum for x = 0
and many small side maxima for x = (2m + 1)π/2.
Therefore, the Fourier transform (11.76) gives, for
each line in the spectrum, a diffraction-like structure.
This is perturbing for a dense spectrum, because the
side maxima of a strong line might overlap with the
principal maxima of adjacent weak lines. Therefore
a Gaussian gate function that does not produce these
diffraction-like features is used instead of the rectan-
gular function. The optimum choice for such a gate
function allows one to reproduce the source spec-
trum without severe perturbations (the use of such
an optimized gate function is called apodization)
[11.17].
For measuring absorption spectra, a radiation
source with continuous emission spectrum is used and

the radiation passes through the absorption cell before
it reaches the detector. In order to enhance the sensitiv-
ity, a special mirror conﬁguration lets the radiation pass
through the absorption cell several times, thus increas-
ing the absorption path length L. The basic operation of
a Fourier interferometer is explained in Fig. 11.33. The
incident radiation to be measured comes from the right.
The signal S(t) is measured by the detector D1, while
the mirror M2 is uniformly moving. The realized in-
crease in path difference for the moving mirror is from
a few centimeters up to some meters depending on the
construction of the instrument.
Since the path difference Δs has to be measured
very accurately it is determined by optical interferom-
etry. The parallel beam of a He-Ne laser is sent into
the left part of the instrument, which forms a sec-
ond Michelson with the same moving mirror M2.
The detector D2 measures the interferogram of the
monochromatic laser radiation, which gives the pat-
tern shown in Fig. 11.32a and serves as an accurate
time base, because the wavelength of the He-Ne laser
is known very precisely. In order to ﬁx the time t = 0,
where both arms of the interferometer have equal path
lengths and therefore Δs = 0, a broad spectral contin-
uum is sent to the interferometer and its interferogram,
which gives approximately a delta-function at t = 0

interferometer is depicted in Fig. 11.34. For illustra-
tion of the attainable sensitivity and spectral resolution

The big advantages of Fourier spectroscopy are
the attainable large spectral resolving power and
the better signal-to-noise ratio at measuring times
that are much less than in conventional spec-
troscopy with spectrometers.
The reason for this is that all frequency components
of the spectrum are measured simultaneously, while,
for instance, in microwave spectroscopy the radiation
source has to be tuned in the course of time over all
spectral intervals. If the total measured spectral interval
Δω is divided into N sections δω (Δω = Nδω), where
δω is the smallest resolvable spectral interval, the sig-
nal S for a given measuring time is N times larger than

achieve the same signal-to-noise ratio as in convention-
al spectroscopy one needs with Fourier spectroscopy
only 1% of the measuring time that is necessary when
a monochromator with spectral resolution δν is tuned
over the whole spectral interval Δν.
11.5 Laser Spectroscopy
The introduction of lasers to spectroscopy has en-
larged the possibilities of spectroscopic investigations
enormously regarding spectral resolution and sensitiv-
ity, which have been enhanced by several orders of
magnitude.
We will brieﬂy discuss in this section some tech-
niques that exemplify the high sensitivity attainable and
the special techniques with exceedingly high spectral
resolution where the Doppler width of the absorp-
tion lines can be overcome and “Doppler-free” spectral
resolution is possible.
Of particular interest is the investigation of ultrafast
phenomena in atoms and molecules, which can nowa-
days be studied with ultrashort laser pulses with a time
resolution of about 1 fs(10−15 s).
For a more detailed representation the reader is
referred to specialist literature [11.18–20].
11.5.1 Laser-Absorption Spectroscopy
Absorption spectroscopy with monochromatic wave-
length-tunable lasers resembles, in many aspects, mi-
crowave spectroscopy (see Sect. 11.2). The advantage
of lasers is, however, their large tuning range, which
exceeds that of clystrons by far, and furthermore their
possible application in many spectral regions from the
far infrared to the extreme ultraviolet [11.21].
A typical experimental setup is shown in Fig. 11.37.
The output beam of a tunable laser is split by a 50%
beam splitter BS2 into a reference beam and a signal
beam that passes through the absorption cell. Another
beam splitter BS1 directs a small fraction of the laser
beam into a long Fabry–Perot interferometer with mir-
ror separation d, which gives equidistant frequency
markers separated by Δν = c/2d.
The advantages of this arrangement compared with
conventional spectroscopy without lasers can be sum-
marized as follows:
•
There is no need for a spectrometer with wave-
length dispersion because the tunable laser is al-
ready monochromatic and the absorption lines

appear as dips in the transmitted laser intensity
when the laser is scanned through the spectrum.
•
The spectral resolution is not limited by any in-
strument, but solely by the width of the absorption
lines, which is generally given by their Doppler
width (see Sect. 7.4.2). With Doppler-free tech-
niques even this limitation can be overcome.
•
Because of the good collimation of the parallel laser
beam a long path length L through the absorption
cell can be realized, for instance, by multipath ar-
rangements with spherical mirrors (see below). This
enhances the sensitivity (since the absorption ΔI =
I0αL is proportional to the absorption length L) and
allows the detection of weak transitions or of tiny
densities of absorbing molecules.
•
If the spectral width δνL of the laser radiation is
smaller than the absorption line width Δνa (which
is the case for single-mode lasers) the measured dif-
ference ΔI = I0 −IT = I0αL is larger than in the
case δν > Δνa where ΔI = I0αL(Δνa/δν).
The latter advantage is often erroneously neglected.
Its importance shall be illustrated by the following
example.
In conventional spectroscopy the grating spectrom-
eter may have a resolution of δν = 0.5 cm−1, while
the Doppler width of the absorption lines in the visi-
ble is typical about Δνa = 0.03 cm−1. This gives for
the same absorption αL at the center of an absorption
line an intensity change ΔI that is 16 times smaller
resulting in a sensitivity that is also 16 times smaller
than for absorption spectroscopy with a laser that has
a bandwidth ΔνL ≪Δνa.
The sensitivity can be further enhanced by modula-
tion of the laser frequency, similarly to the situation in
microwave spectroscopy. Here we will, however, con-
sider the case where the frequency modulation is larger
than the line width of the absorbing transitions.
When the laser beam from a tunable diode laser
passes through an electro-optic modulator (this is
a crystal that changes its refractive index proportion-
al to the voltage applied to electrodes on opposite
sides of the crystal) the optical path length periodically
changes and with it the phase of the optical wave. This
phase modulation results in a frequency modulation be-
cause the frequency ω = dϕ/dt is the derivative of the
phase ϕ. The modulation of the optical carrier frequen-
cy ω creates sidebands at frequencies ω ± Ω, where Ω

mode diode laser with phase-modulation
is the modulation frequency. Differently from pure fre-
quency modulation, the phases of the two sidebands are
opposite (Fig. 11.38). If the transmitted intensity (this
is the sum of the intensities of carrier and sidebands) is
detected by a phase-sensitive detector (lock-in) tuned
to the modulation frequency Ω, the measured signal
is zero if there is no absorption, because the detector
measures the two differences Ic −I+ and Ic −I−of
the intensities Ic of the carrier and I± of the two side-
bands, which have opposite signs and therefore cancel
each other. If, however, one of the sidebands coincides
with an absorption line, this sideband is attenuated and
the balance is lost. Fluctuations of the incident intensity
appears in the carrier and the sidebands and therefore
cancel for the difference measurement. The schematic
arrangement for absorption spectroscopy with a tunable
diode laser is shown in Fig. 11.39.
The enhanced sensitivity is illustrated in Fig. 11.40,
which compares the absorption measurement of a weak
overtone absorption line of the H2O molecule with
a non-modulated diode laser and the signal obtained
with the modulation technique. The signal-to-noise
ratio is enhanced by two orders of magnitude.

energy level Ei = Ek + hν by absorption of a pho-
ton hν (Fig. 11.41). If the excited molecule collides
with other atoms or molecules in the cell, it can trans-
fer its excitation energy into translational energy. If
N1 molecules are excited, the kinetic energy Ekin =

ΔEkin = N1 · h · ν = 3

(11.76)
For a closed cell, the total number of molecules N is
constant. A temperature rise therefore increases the gas
pressure p = nkT with n = N/V by Δp = nkΔT .
The energy of the absorbed photons is convert-
ed into kinetic energy resulting in a pressure
increase.
So far we have neglected the radiative decay of
the excited level. If the emitted photons are not ab-
sorbed within the cell, their energy is not converted into
a pressure increase. The transferred energy is now
ΔE = N1hν

1 + τcoll/τrad
.
The conversion becomes more efﬁcient as the ratio of
radiative lifetime to the collisional deactivation time of
the excited level (τrad/τcoll) increases.

time 1/Ttr = (1/τcoll + 1/τrad) the pressure in the cell
is modulated at the frequency f . A sensitive micro-
phone in the side wall of the cell detects these pressure
changes, which represent acoustic waves. When the
chopping frequency is chosen to coincide with one
of the acoustical eigenresonances of the cell, standing
acoustic waves are generated with amplitudes that are
dependent on the acoustic quality factor Q of the cell
and are much higher than for the nonresonant case.
The technique is quite sensitive, because the acous-
tic resonator acts as an ampliﬁer and stores the energy
converted from the excited molecules into standing
acoustic waves for a time τ ∝Q. When the laser wave-
length is tuned across a molecular absorption spectrum
one obtains for each absorption line an acoustic sig-
nal and altogether an optoacoustic spectrum. As an
illustration Fig. 11.42 shows the optoacoustic spec-
trum of a very weak overtone band in acetylene, with
the different rotational lines. Since the absorbed op-
tical photon energy is converted into acoustic energy
the method is named optoacoustic or photoacoustic
spectroscopy [11.22, 23].
The sensitivity can be further enhanced when the
acoustic cell is placed inside an optical multiple pass
cell (Fig. 11.43). The laser beams inside this cell with
spherical mirrors form a hyperboloid with cylindrical
symmetry and excite acoustic standing waves on those
locations in the acoustic cell where the standing acous-
tic waves have maximum amplitude. This optimizes the
conversion efﬁciency for the energy transfer into the
acoustic mode.

11.5.3 Optogalvanic Spectroscopy
For the spectroscopy of high-lying atomic, molecular
or ionic levels, gas discharges are convenient because
many of these levels are populated by electron impact,
in particular, metastable levels with long lifetimes. The
discharge impedance depends on the number of elec-
trically charged carriers, i.e., electrons and ions, which
are created by electron impact ionization from excited
levels of the neutral species. If the population of these
excited levels is changed, for instance by absorption
of photons, the electron density will change and there-
fore the impedance of the discharge. If the discharge is
fed through a ballast resistor R by a power supply with
constant voltage, the impedance change causes a corre-
sponding change of the discharge current and therefore
a voltage change across resistor R. This forms the basis
for optogalvanic spectroscopy.

coincides with an absorption line of species in the
discharge, this causes a modulation of the level densi-
ties Ni, Nk and therefore of the discharge current at
the chopping frequency and a corresponding voltage
modulation ΔU across the ballast resistor R. This
modulated voltage is coupled through a capacitance C
into a lock-in ampliﬁer and recorded by a computer. If
the laser wavelength is tuned to a transition Ei →Ek
the population of the two levels changes due to
laser-induced transitions by
ΔNi = Ni0 −NiL = −ΔNk .
The corresponding voltage change is then
ΔU = RΔI
(11.77)
= a[ΔNi P I(Ei) −ΔNk P I(Ek)] ,
where P I(Ei) is the ionization probability of level Ei.
The optogalvanic signals might be positive or neg-
ative, depending on the difference of ionization proba-
bilities of the levels Ei and Ek.
Most gas discharge tubes are ﬁlled with noble gas-
es. However, if the noble gas is mixed with other
volatile components their spectra can be also measured
by this technique. Even molecules can be inserted into
the discharge. Since some molecules might be frag-
mented by electron impact, the spectra of the mother
molecules and their fragments overlap and the assign-
ment might be difﬁcult.
In a hollow cathode discharge, the ions impinge on
the inner walls of the hollow cathode and release atoms
and ions of the wall material by sputtering process-
es. With higher discharge currents the spectra of these
sputtered materials become more and more prominent.
This is illustrated in Fig. 11.45, where the optogalvan-
ic spectrum of aluminum, copper and iron obtained in
a hollow cathode discharge is shown.
Investigations of intensity and time behavior of
optogalvanic signals give information on radiative de-
cay constants of highly excited levels and on collision
cross sections for electron impact excitation and ioniza-
tion. These parameters are important for understanding
plasma characteristics [11.24].
Since in the gas discharge many intermediate lev-
els are populated, it is possible to reach by one-photon
absorption very high atomic or molecular levels. One
example is the investigation of atomic Rydberg levels
by optogalvanic spectroscopy [11.25, 26].
11.5.4 Cavity-Ringdown Spectroscopy
A very sensitive technique for detecting small absorp-
tions is cavity-ringdown spectroscopy, which is based
on measurements of the decay time of optical res-
onators ﬁlled with an absorbing gas [11.28]. Its basic
principle can be understood as follows.
When a short laser pulse with power P0 is sent
through the optical resonator of length L with two high-
ly reﬂecting mirrors (reﬂectivities R1 = R2 = R) and

total absorption losses A (scattering, diffraction and
mirror absorption, but excluding the absorption by the
gas) the transmission
T = 1 −R −A ≪1
is very small. The pulse will be reﬂected back and forth
between the two mirrors (Fig. 11.46), while for each
roundtrip a small fraction will be transmitted through
the end mirror and can reach the detector. The detector
receives a series of pulses separated by the roundtrip
time T = 2L/c with decreasing power from pulse to
pulse.
The power of the ﬁrst transmitted pulse is
P1 = T 2e−αL P0 ,
(11.78a)
where α is the absorption coefﬁcient of the gas in the
resonator. After each roundtrip the pulse power de-
creases by an additional factor R2 · exp(−2αL). After
m roundtrips the power has decreased to
Pm =

which can be written with ln(1 −x) ≈x for x ≪1 as
Pm = P1e2m[ln R−αL] ≈P1e−2m[T +A+αL] .
(11.78c)
If the detector time constant is large compared to the
pulse width it just detects the envelope of the pulse
amplitudes and records an exponential decay with the
decay time
τ1 =
L/c
T + A + αL .

decay time will be lengthened to

(11.80)
From the difference

(11.81)
the absorption coefﬁcient α can be determined as
a function of the laser wavelength λ. The minimum de-
tectable absorption is limited by the reﬂectivity R, the
unavoidable losses A of the resonator and by the ac-
curacy of measuring the decay times τ1 and τ2. This
accuracy is limited by the attainable signal-to-noise
ratio.
The physical reason for the large sensitivity is the
long effective absorption path, which is
Leff = L/(1 −R + A) .
(11.82)
EXAMPLE
For L = 1 m, R = 0.999, A = 0.001 ⇒Leff = 500 m.
The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 11.47.
The incoming laser beam has to be mode-matched to
the fundamental TEM00q resonator mode. Otherwise
transverse modes are excited, which have much higher
diffraction losses (see Sect. 8.2). A careful alignment of
the system is required to obtain optimum results. When
the laser wavelength is tuned across the absorption
spectrum the maxima of the absorption coefﬁcient α
at the center of the absorption lines lead to decay time
minima and a computer program converts these mea-
sured minima into the absorption coefﬁcient α(λ). In

Fig. 11.48 the rotational spectrum of the overtone tran-
sition in the HCN molecule, measured by Romanini
and Lehman [11.29] is shown, illustrating the good
signal-to-noise ratio.
The following conditions should be met to realize
the high sensitivity and spectral resolution:
1. Due to the spectral bandwidth of the laser pulse
many fundamental resonator modes within the
bandwidth δωR can be excited. In order to resolve
the absorption lines with spectral width δωa the
laser bandwidth δωL should be smaller than the
absorption line width.
2. The relaxation time of the resonator must be longer
than that of the excited molecules. This demands
high reﬂection coatings of the cavity mirrors (R >
0.999) and careful alignment.
EXAMPLE
With a resonator length L = 0.5 m, a mirror reﬂec-
tivity R = 0.998, resonator losses per roundtrip A =
0.001 and mirror transmission T = 0.0001 per mir-
ror, the decay time of the empty resonator is τ2 =
0.5/(3 × 108 × 0.002) = 8.33 × 10−7 s. With an ab-
sorption coefﬁcient α = 10−6/cm = 10−4/m the ab-
sorption per path is αL = 5 × 10−5 and the decay
time τ2 of the ﬁlled resonator becomes τ2 = 0.5/(3 ×
108 × 0.00205) = 8.13 × 10−7 s. The relative change
of τ is only Δτ/τ = 0.024 = 2.4%. With a laser pulse
duration ΔtL = 10 ns the laser bandwidth is δωL =
108 s−1 ⇒δνL = 16 MHz, which is small compared to
the Doppler width of about 1 GHz of the absorption
lines.
With a reﬂectivity R = 0.9995 and transmission
T = 0.00005 and resonator losses A = 0.0001 The
decay time τ2 becomes τ2 = 1 · 10−5 s and τ1 =
8.3 · 10−6 s. Now the difference becomes 1.7 · 10−6s
which is 17% of the decay time τ2. This demon-
strates the importance of low loss resonators and high
reﬂectivity mirrors.
11.5.5 Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy
So far we have mainly discussed different techniques of
absorption spectroscopy. Laser-induced ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy is based on selective excitation of one or
a few levels in the upper state of atoms or molecules.
The ﬂuorescence spectrum, emitted by this excited lev-
el, is dispersed by a spectrometer and the dispersed
ﬂuorescence lines are recorded by a photomultiplier or
a CCD array (Fig. 11.49). If the ﬂuorescence is emit-
ted from a single upper rotational-vibrational level of
a molecule the allowed transitions represent a relative-
ly simple spectrum compared to an emission spectrum
from a gas discharge, where many upper levels are pop-
ulated and the total ﬂuorescence is the superposition of
all ﬂuorescence series emitted by the different upper
levels.
The wavenumbers of the ﬂuorescence lines are
equal to the differences between the term value of the
upper level and those of the terminating lower levels. If
the upper level is the same for all lines the separations
of the ﬂuorescence lines just give the energy differ-
ences between the levels in the lower state (Fig. 11.50).
If the Franck–Condon factors for transitions into high
vibrational levels of the electronic ground state are
sufﬁciently large (this depends on the excited upper vi-
brational level), the vibrational levels in the electronic

(b) Fluorescence spectrum of the Na2 molecule, emitted from
the selectively excited level B1Πu (v′ = 6, J′ = 27)
ground state can be measured up to the dissociation en-
ergy. This allows a very accurate determination of the
potential curve [11.30].
In another technique the total ﬂuorescence intensi-
ty (without dispersion by a spectrometer) is measured
as a function of the wavelength of the exciting laser
(Fig. 11.51). In this case the ﬂuorescence is just used
for monitoring the absorption, because each absorbed
photon creates a ﬂuorescence photon if other deac-
tivation processes of the excited level (for instance
collision-induced radiationless transitions) can be ne-
glected. This excitation spectroscopy is a very sensitive
version of absorption spectroscopy, as can be seen from
the following estimation:

a photomultiplier, create ˙npe photoelectrons per sec-
ond. With the quantum efﬁciency of the photocathode
ηph = ˙npe/˙nﬂ, the rate of absorbed laser photons ˙na,
the ﬂuorescence quantum yield ηﬂ= ˙nﬂ/˙na, the ge-
ometrical collection efﬁciency δ of the ﬂuorescence
photons onto the photocathode, the measured rate of
photoelectrons is given by the signal
S = ˙npe = ˙naηﬂηphδ .
(11.83)
The absorption rate
˙na = NkσkinLΔx
(11.84)
depends on the number density Nk of molecules in the
absorbing level ⟨k|, the absorption cross section σki, the
number nL of laser photons incident per s and cm2 onto
the sample and the absorption path length Δx.
EXAMPLE
With a quantum efﬁciency ηph = 0.2 of the multipli-
er photocathode, a collection efﬁciency of δ = 0.1,
which demands a collection optics for the ﬂuorescence
that covers a solid angle of 0.4π, a ﬂuorescence yield
ηk = 1 for the excited level ⟨k| and a laser photon
ﬂux of NL = 3 × 1018/s that corresponds to a laser
power of 1 W at λ = 500 nm, an absorption rate na =
104/s (which means a relative absorption of the laser
of ΔIL/IL = 3 × 10−15) gives a photoelectron rate of
npe = 200/s. If the dark current of the photomultiplier
is npe(0) = 50, this gives a signal to background ratio
of 4, which demonstrates that relative absorptions of
less than 10−15 can still be detected. This represents
a much higher sensitivity than any direct absorption
measurement!

orescence, consisting of an elliptical mirror in the upper half
and a spherical mirror in the lower half of the plane
The collection efﬁciency for ﬂuorescence photons
can be enlarged by an elliptical mirror arrangement
(Fig. 11.52). If the intersection A of laser and molec-
ular beams is placed in one focal point of the ellipsoid,
the ﬂuorescence is imaged into the second focal point B
where an optical ﬁber bundle transmits it either direct-
ly to the photomultiplier or to the entrance slit of the
spectrometer.
11.5.6 Ionization Spectroscopy
The most sensitive detection technique is ioniza-
tion spectroscopy. Here a laser is tuned through the
spectrum of interest and excites for each absorb-
ing transition a selected upper level. Differently from
ﬂuorescence-excitation spectroscopy, here not the ﬂuo-
rescence is monitored, but the molecule in the excited
level is ionized by a second laser (Fig. 11.53). If this
laser is sufﬁciently intense, the ionizing transition can
be saturated, which means that every excited molecule
is ionized before it can emit a ﬂuorescence photon or
can be deactivated by collisions. The ions are collect-
ed by electric ﬁelds, accelerated and imaged onto the
cathode of an open ion multiplier. This is a device that
Fig. 11.53a,b. Ionization spectroscopy. (a) Level scheme for
resonant twp-photon ionization. (b) Experimental setup for
photo-ionization in a molecular beam
is quite similar to a photomultiplier. Only the photo-
cathode is replaced by a metal cathode, where the ions,
impinging with energies of a few keV, produce elec-
trons by ion bombardment. These electrons are further
accelerated and multiplied like in a photomultiplier.
With an optimum ion collecting system design,
each ion produced through photoionization, can be
imaged onto the ion multiplier and produces a volt-
age pulse at the multiplier output that can be
counted.
If the ﬁrst laser with wavelength λ1 is tuned through
the spectral region of interest and the second laser with
a ﬁxed wavelength λ2 ionizes all excited molecules the
measured ion rate Nion(λ1) essentially gives the absorp-
tion spectrum α(λ1) of transitions from the absorbing
levels in the electronic ground state to the levels ex-
cited by laser L1. The sensitivity of this method is,
however, higher by several orders of magnitude than in
absorption spectroscopy, where the attenuation of the
transmitted laser intensity is monitored.
In favorable cases, single atoms or molecules can
be detected [11.31].
The number of ions produced per second is deter-
mined similarly to (11.84) by
˙Nion = Niσi I ˙NL2 ,
(11.85)
where Ni is the stationary population of the excited lev-
el ⟨i| and ˙NL2 is the photon ﬂux of laser L2 incident on
the molecules in level ⟨i|.
The stationary density Ni of molecules in level ⟨i|
is determined from the balance between the excitation
and depopulation processes. If Ri is the total relax-
ation probability of the excited level ⟨i| (besides the

11.5. Laser Spectroscopy
453
ionization probability Pi I = σi I NL2), we obtain
dNi
t
= Nkσki ˙NL1 −Ni(Ri + σi I ˙NL2) = 0
⇒Ni = Nk
σki · ˙NL1
Ri + σi I ˙NL2
.
(11.86)
For a stationary population Nk of molecules in the ab-
sorbing level ⟨k| the reﬁlling rate must be equal to the
excitation rate which equals the rate ˙na of absorbed
photons. The reﬁlling rate is supplied either by relax-
ation processes of other levels into level ⟨k| or by the
ﬂow of molecules into the excitation volume.
This gives for the measured ion rate (11.85)
˙Nion = Nk
σki ˙NL1
1 + Ri/(σi I ˙NL2) .
(11.87a)
For (σi I ˙NL2) ≫Ri the ion rate becomes
˙Nion = Nkσki ˙NL1 = ˙na
(11.87b)
and the measured signal
S = ˙Nionδη
(11.87c)
becomes for δ = η = 1 equal to the rate ˙na of ab-
sorbed photons on the transition k →i. Here δ is the
collection efﬁciency of the ions onto the multiplier
cathode and η the detection efﬁciency of the multiplier
for one impinging ion.
With proper ion collecting optics, δ = 1 can be
reached. For ions with kinetic energies of several keV
the multiplier efﬁciency is η = 1. If the second laser
is sufﬁciently intense, Pi I ≫Ri. Then (11.87c) gives
for δ = η = 1 : SI = ˙na. This means that every photon
of the ﬁrst laser, absorbed on the transition k →i is
converted into a signal pulse.
Under favorable conditions every absorbed pho-
ton can result in a signal count. With sufﬁciently
large laser intensities this implies that single
atoms or molecules can be detected.

N = 109 cm−3
(corresponding to a gas pressure of 10−7 mbar). If
0.1% of all molecules are in the absorbing level ⟨k| the
density of absorbing molecules is Nk = 106 cm−3. The
absorption coefﬁcient is α = Nkσki = 10−8/cm. With
a path length Δx = 1 cm, 10−8 of all incident photons
are absorbed. When the number of photons per s of
the ﬁrst laser is ˙NL1 = 3 × 1016 (10 mW), we obtain
na = 3 × 108 s−1. Under stationary conditions this
absorption rate must be compensated for by an equal
reﬁlling rate. In a gas at room temperature the mean
molecular velocity is about 500 m/s = 5 × 104 cm/s.
At a density of 106 cm−3 absorbing molecules, the
reﬁlling rate could even compensate a depopulation
rate of 1010 s−1 in a volume of 1 cm3.
11.5.7 Laser Spectroscopy in Molecular Beams
In many cases, spectral resolution is limited by the
Doppler width of the absorption lines. This limitation
often prevents the recognition of ﬁner details in the
spectrum, such as hyperﬁne splittings, Zeeman split-
tings in weak external ﬁelds or the rotational structure
in molecular spectra. Doppler-free techniques that can
overcome the limitations set by the Doppler width
are then demanded for getting the full information
from atomic or molecular spectra. We will discuss
in the following sections some of these Doppler-free
techniques.
An elegant way to reduce the Doppler width is
the reduction of the velocity distribution of atoms or
molecules in collimated molecular beams (Fig. 11.54).

from A downstream in the molecular beam in order
to reach the interaction region with the laser beam. If
we choose the molecular beam axis as the z-axis and
place the slit in the y direction, the vx component of
the molecules passing through the slit is reduced by the
geometrical factor
vx ≤(b/2d)v = vz tan ε ,
(11.88)
where v = (8kT/πm)1/2 is the mean velocity of parti-
cles with mass m, when the temperature of the reservoir
is T , vz is the velocity component parallel to the beam
axis and ε with tan ε = b/2d is the collimation angle.
If the beam of a tunable single mode laser crosses
the molecular beam in x direction (i.e., perpendicu-
lar to the molecular beam axis) behind the slit, only
molecules within the narrow interval vx ≤(b/2d)v
contribute to the absorption, which means that the
width Δν of the absorption line is reduced compared
to its Doppler width in a gas at thermal equilibrium
(Fig. 11.54).
EXAMPLE
With b = 1 mm, d = 100 mm ⇒tan ε = 5 × 10−3.
Instead of a typical Doppler width of ΔνD = 1 GHz
in the optical range, the line width is now reduced by
a factor of 200 to Δνred
D
= 5 MHz. This is already in
the range of the natural line width (see Sect. 7.4.1).
The quantitative treatment starts with the density
of molecules in the beam with velocities v within the

(11.89)

High resolution absorption spectra can be mea-
sured by monitoring the total ﬂuorescence Iﬂ(λL) as
a function of the laser wavelength (excitation spec-
troscopy) or by resonant two-photon ionization, where
the ions are extracted by an electric ﬁeld from the in-
tersection volume of molecular and laser beams onto
the ion multiplier. In Fig. 11.55, PM1 measures the
total ﬂuorescence, while PM2 behind a monochroma-
tor monitors the dispersed ﬂuorescence at a ﬁxed laser
wavelength. If the two-photon ionization occurs in the
ion source of a mass spectrometer the ions can be
mass selected. This is very helpful for the assignment
if many different masses (e.g., isotopes or different
cluster sizes in a cluster beam) are present.
As an illustration of the attainable spectral res-
olution Fig. 11.56 shows the hyperﬁne structure of
a rotational transition of the Na2 molecule in the elec-
tronic transition from the X1Σg ground state into the
mixed A1Σu −a3Πu upper state, where the two upper
states are mixed by spin-orbit coupling. For symmetry
reasons only components with nuclear spin quantum
number I = 1 and 3 are possible in a rotational level
with even rotational quantum number J ′ = 24.

11.5.8 Nonlinear Laser Spectroscopy
Several spectroscopic techniques that achieve sub-
Doppler resolution are based on the nonlinear interac-
tion of molecules with the laser radiation. When a plane
electromagnetic wave passes in x direction through an
absorbing gas, we saw in Sect. 11.1 that the attenu-
ation dI of the intensity is related to the absorption
coefﬁcient α by
dI = −αIdx .
(11.94)
The absorption coefﬁcient
α(ω) = [Nk −(gk/gi)Ni]σ(ω) = ΔN · σ(ω)
(11.95)
is determined by the population difference ΔN and the
absorption cross section σ. This gives for (11.94) the
relation
dI = −ΔN · σ(ω) · I · dx .
(11.96)
For sufﬁciently small intensities I the population den-
sities Ni and Nk are not much affected by absorption
transitions, because relaxation processes can reﬁll the
population Nk of the absorbing level (Fig. 11.57a). In
this case the absorption coefﬁcient α is independent of

the intensity I and integration of (11.94) yields Beer’s
law of linear absorption
I = I0e−αx = I0e−ΔNσ x .
(11.97)
For larger intensities the absorption rate can exceed the
relaxation rates reﬁlling the absorbing level ⟨k|. This
means that the population Nk decreases with increasing
intensity I and therefore the absorption coefﬁcient also
decreases. Instead of (11.96) we have to write
dI = −ΔN(I) · I · σ · dx .
(11.98)
The change dI of the intensity and therefore the ab-
sorbed power depends in a nonlinear way on the in-
cident intensity. We can write the intensity dependent
population of the absorbing level ⟨k| as a power series
Nk = Nk0 + dNk
dI I + 1

d2Nk
dI 2 I 2 + . . .
(11.99a)
and a corresponding relation for the upper level ⟨i|,
where dNk/dI < 0 and dNi/dI > 0.
For the population difference we obtain (Fig.11.57b):
ΔN(I) = ΔN0 + d(ΔN)

Inserting this into (11.98) gives
dI = −

)
dx .
(11.100)
The ﬁrst term describes the linear absorption, the
second term is quadratically dependent on I and
diminishes the absorption because d(ΔN)/dI < 0.
The nonlinear absorption can be demonstrated by
measuring the intensity of the laser-induced ﬂuo-
rescence Iﬂ(IL) as a function of the laser intensity
(Fig. 11.57c). One can see that at ﬁrst Iﬂincreas-
es linearly with IL, but for higher laser intensities
the increase is less than linear, because the absorp-
tion coefﬁcient decreases and therefore the relative
absorption of the laser intensity dIL/IL. For large
laser intensities the ﬂuorescence intensity approaches
a constant value (saturation), which is limited by the
rate of the relaxation processes reﬁlling the absorbing
level ⟨k|.
This saturation of the absorption can be used for
Doppler-free spectroscopy, as will be outlined in the
next section.
11.5.9 Saturation Spectroscopy
We consider a sample of atoms or molecules in the
gas phase with a Doppler-broadened absorption proﬁle
around the center frequency ω0. When a monochro-
matic laser beam with frequency ω passes in the x
direction through the sample, only those molecules that
are Doppler-shifted into resonance with the laser fre-
quency can absorb the laser photons. Since the Doppler
shift is Δω = kvx, these molecules must have velocity
components vx that satisfy the relation
ω = ω0(1 + kvx) .
(11.101)
Because of saturation, the population Nk in the absorb-
ing level of these molecules decreases and Ni increases
accordingly. In the velocity distribution Nk(vx) of all
molecules, a narrow dip is burnt while a corresponding
peak appears in the distribution Ni(vx) of molecules in
the upper level (Fig. 11.58a).
If the laser beam is reﬂected by a mirror back in-
to the sample, its k-vector is reversed and molecules
with opposite velocity components interact with the
reﬂected beam (Fig. 11.58b). Now for ωL ̸= ω0 two

population difference ΔN(vx) for ΩL ̸= Ω0 (c) Lamb-dip at
Ω = Ω0 of the Doppler-broadened proﬁle of molecules in
a standing laser wave
holes are burnt into the velocity distribution of the
inversion ΔN(vx), i.e., two different velocity classes
interact with the two laser beams.
When the laser frequency ωL is tuned over the
Doppler-broadened absorption proﬁle the two holes
move towards each other when ωL approaches the cen-
ter frequency ω0 of the molecular transition. For ωL =
ω0, only one velocity class in the interval dvx around
vx = 0 interacts with both laser beams. The molecules
experience the double intensity and therefore the pop-
ulation inversion ΔN will be more decreased for ωL =
ω0 than for ωL ̸= ω0. The absorption coefﬁcient α(ω)
with a Doppler-broadened proﬁle, therefore has a dip
around the center frequency ω0 (Fig. 11.58c). This
dip, caused by saturation of the population, is called
a Lamb dip after Willis Lamb (Nobel Prize, 1955), who
explained this saturation effect quantitatively.
The width of the Lamb dip equals the natural line
width of the molecular transition, broadened by
saturation and collisions. It is about two orders
of magnitude smaller than the Doppler width.
This narrow Lamb dip is used for Doppler-free
spectroscopy (called saturation or Lamb dip spec-
troscopy). Assume two transitions from a common
level ⟨c| into two slightly split levels ⟨a| and ⟨b|. If
the splitting is smaller than the Doppler width, the two
Doppler-broadened spectral lines cannot be resolved.
Fig. 11.59. Overlapping Doppler proﬁles of two close transi-
tions with a clear separation of their Lamb dips
Fig. 11.60. Possible experimental setup for saturation spec-
troscopy
However, the two Lamb dips of these transitions are
well separated (Fig. 11.59).
A possible experimental arrangement is shown in
Fig. 11.60). The beam of a wavelength-tunable laser
is split by beam splitter BS into a strong pump beam
and a weak probe beam that pass into opposite direc-
tions through the sample cell. The detector measures
the transmitted probe beam intensity as a function of
the laser frequency ωL. Each time the laser frequency
coincides with the center frequency of a molecular tran-
sition, a Lamb peak appears in the transmitted intensity,
because the absorption exhibits a dip at this frequency.
If the absorbed laser power is measured instead of
the transmitted intensity (for instance by monitoring

immediately seen. This is demonstrated in Fig. 11.61a,
which shows the unresolved Doppler-broadened pro-
ﬁles of 15 hyperﬁne components of a rotational tran-
sition in the visible absorption spectrum of the iodine
molecule I2 with well-resolved Lamb dips.
The Doppler-broadened background can be elimi-
nated when the pump beam is periodically chopped.
Now a lock-in detector measures the difference of the
transmitted probe intensity with the pump beam on and
off. The result is a Doppler-free spectrum (Fig. 11.61b)
with a better signal-to-noise ratio.
Even with low-power lasers, saturation spec-
troscopy can be performed when the sample is placed
inside the laser resonator where the intensity is much
higher than outside the resonator (Fig. 11.62). The
standing wave inside the resonator can be composed
of a back and forth traveling wave. Therefore the con-
ditions for producing a Lamb dip are automatically
fulﬁlled. Either the laser-induced ﬂuorescence from the
sample molecules can be monitored, which exhibits the
Lamb dips, or the laser intensity transmitted through
one of the resonator mirrors is measured, which shows
corresponding narrow peaks in the laser output power
at the center frequencies of the absorption lines of
the sample molecules. The laser wavelength can be
tuned by changing continuously the length of the laser
resonator. If the resonator length is additionally mod-
ulated while the laser wavelength is scanned, the ﬁrst
derivative of the Lamb dips or peaks is measured
with a lock-in, tuned to the modulation frequency. In
Fig. 11.63 such a derivative spectrum of the rotation-
al transition B3Πu (v′ = 58, J ′ = 99) ←X1Σ+
g (v′′ =
1, J ′′ = 98) in the I2 molecule is shown with its 21

each of the two components is further split into “super-
hyperﬁne components,” due to Coriolis effects and

11.5.10 Doppler-Free Two-Photon Spectroscopy
For sufﬁciently strong laser intensities, an atom or
molecule can simultaneously absorb two photons ¯hω1
and ¯hω2 from two lasers, or two photons ¯hω1 from
the same laser. Depending on the relative orienta-
tions of the two-photon spins, optical transitions with
ΔL = 0 or ΔL = ±2 are induced. Two-photon transi-
tions are weaker by several orders of magnitude than
allowed one-photon transitions. Therefore, lasers with
sufﬁciently high intensities are demanded for their ob-
servation. The probability of two-photon absorption is
greatly enhanced if a molecular level Em is close to the
energy Ek + ¯hω1 or Ek + ¯hω2 (Fig. 11.65).
For a two-photon transition from the initial lower
level ⟨k| to the ﬁnal level ⟨f | in a molecule at rest, the
energy conservation demands
E f −Ek = ¯h(ω1 + ω2) .
(11.102)
When the molecule moves with velocity v, the
frequency ω of the light wave is shifted in the molec-
ular frame to ω′ = ω −k · v. The resonance condition
(11.102) now becomes
E f −Ek = ¯h(ω1 + ω2) −¯hv(k1 + k2) . (11.103)

ton energies, (b) with ω2 = ω1. (c) Resonant two photon
transitions with a real intermediate level Em
If the two photons come from two beams of the
same laser traveling in opposite directions, we have
the situation that ω1 = ω2 and k1 = −k2. This has
the consequence that the last term in (11.103)
containing the velocity of the molecule becomes
zero.
The two-photon absorption becomes, in this case,
independent of the molecular velocity, meaning
that all molecules within the velocity distribution
contribute to the two-photon absorption, which is
now Doppler-free.

arrangement
is
shown
in
Fig. 11.66. The sample is irradiated by the focussed
beam of a tunable dye laser and by the focussed
beam reﬂected by the spherical mirror M. The two-
photon transition is monitored by the laser-induced
ﬂuorescence emitted from the upper level E f into
intermediate levels Em that are connected to ⟨f |

one-photon
transitions.
A
Faraday-
rotator acts as an optical diode and prevents the
reﬂected laser beam from passing back into the
laser, because this could cause instabilities to the
laser.
When the laser frequency ω is tuned over the two-
photon resonance, the signal consists of a narrow peak
(produced by two photons with opposite k vectors) and
a Doppler-broadened background, produced by two
photons from the same beam with parallel k vectors
(Fig. 11.67). The Doppler width is twice as large as
that of a one-photon transition with frequency ω. The
probability that the two photons come from opposite

same beam. This implies that twice as many molecules
contribute to the narrow peak than to the broad back-
ground. The narrow peak is therefore 2 × ΔωD/Δωn
times as high as the background. Since the Doppler
width ΔωD is about two orders of magnitude larger
than the natural line width Δωn the background can be
neglected.

11.6 Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy has proved to be a powerful tool
for investigating the vibrational structure of molecules
in their electronic ground state. We will see that
this method is often complementary to infrared spec-
troscopy. It has seen a great renaissance since lasers
have been used as intense light sources, which have
vastly increased its possibilities.
11.6.1 Basic Principles
Raman spectroscopy is based on the inelastic scatter-
ing of light by molecules and was ﬁrst discovered by
Chandrasekhara Raman in 1928 (Nobel Prize 1930).
In the context of photons we can describe it as fol-
lows. A photon ¯hω0 collides with a molecule in level
Ek (Fig. 11.69a), transfers part of its energy to the in-
ternal energy of the molecule, which is excited to the
ﬁnal level Ef, and the scattered photon ¯hωs has less
energy, i.e., its frequency has decreased:
¯hω0 + M(Ek) →M∗(Ef) + ¯hωs
(11.104)
with
¯h(ω0 −ωs) = Ef −Ei > 0 .
The energy difference ΔE = Ef −Ei may appear
as vibrational, rotational or electronic energy of the
molecule (Fig. 11.69b). The inelastic scattered radia-
tion is called Stokes radiation.
If the photon ¯hω0 is scattered by an excited
molecule, super-elastic scattering may occur, where the
excitation energy is transferred to the scattered photon,

which now has a higher energy than the incident photon
(Fig. 11.69c). This super-elastically scattered radiation
is called anti-Stokes radiation.
In the energy level scheme of Fig. 11.69 the in-
termediate state Ev = Ek + ¯hωo during the scattering
process is often formally described as a virtual state,
which, however, is not a real stationary eigenstate of
the molecule. If this virtual state coincides with one of
the molecular eigenstates one speaks of the “resonance
Raman effect”.
In the spectrum of the scattered light, different
frequencies may appear: the elastically scattered radi-
ation, called Rayleigh-scattering, the inelastic Stokes
contribution of the Raman scattering and the super-
elastic anti-Stokes lines (Fig. 11.70).
The classical description of the Raman effect starts
with the electric dipole moment
p(E) = p0 + ˜αE ,
(11.105)
written as the sum of an eventual permanent mo-
ment p0 and a ﬁeld-dependent contribution pind =
˜αE, where ˜α is the electric polarizability, which is
a tensor of rank two with components αi j.
The dipole moment and the polarizability can both
depend on the nuclear displacements qn of the vi-
brating molecule. For small displacements from the
equilibrium position we can expand the two quantities
into the Taylor series

The ﬁrst term represents the permanent dipole mo-
ment of the molecule. The second term is responsible
for the infrared spectrum, where the intensities of
the transitions depend on the derivatives ∂p/∂qn (see
Sect. 9.5.1). The third term is responsible for the elas-
tic Rayleigh scattering, while the last term describes the
Raman scattering, where the intensities of the Raman
lines depend on the derivatives ∂α/∂qn of the polar-
izability. In Fig. 11.71 the dependences ∂p/∂q and
∂α/∂q are shown for the three normal vibrations of the
linear CO2 molecule. The change of the dipole moment
with the vibrational displacements is only nonzero for
the bending vibration ν2 and for the asymmetric stretch
vibration ν3. These normal modes are therefore called
infrared active. On the other hand the polarizability α
changes for the symmetric stretch vibration ν1, which
is called Raman active. This shows that infrared and
Raman spectroscopy supplement each other.
There are many molecules with vibrational modes
that are infrared as well as Raman active. However,
there are always vibrations that are only either infrared
or Raman active.

11.6.2 Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy
Even with strong pump beams the intensity of spon-
taneously scattered Raman light is often very weak.
Here a new technique is useful, which is based on
the coherent ampliﬁcation of molecular vibrations by
interaction with two incident laser waves. The fre-
quencies ω1 and ω2 of the two lasers are chosen in
such a way that ω1 −ω2 equals the vibrational fre-
quency ωvib of a Raman active normal vibration of
the molecule. This technique is called coherent anti-
Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). Its principle is
illustrated in Fig. 11.72. Instead of the spontaneously

Wave vector conditions for phase matching in gases (above)
and for liquids or solids with dispersion (below)
scattered Stokes radiation induced by the pump wave
with ω1, the downward transition from the virtual
level ⟨v1| to the excited vibrational level Ef is now
caused by stimulated emission induced by the sec-
ond laser with ω2 = ω1 −Ef/¯h. This produces a much
larger population in level Ef than could be achieved
with spontaneous Stokes radiation. Starting from level
Ef a second photon ¯hω1 from laser L1 induces the anti-
Stokes radiation with frequency ωa = 2ω1 −ω2 with
ω2 = ωs. The anti-Stokes wave is emitted as a coher-
ent wave if the three waves are in phase. This can be
achieved if the phase-matching condition
ka = 2kL1 −ks
(11.109)
with ⃗ks = ⃗kL2 is fulﬁlled (Fig. 11.72b). This condition
represents the conservation of momentum for the four
participating photons. In gases, where the dispersion
is small, all vectors have to be parallel, while in liq-
uids or solids, where dispersion cannot be neglected,
the phase-matching condition requires the angle α bet-
ween the pump beam and the anti-Stokes wave. The
two incident laser beams are also not collinear, but have
different directions with an angle β between them.
A possible experimental arrangement for CARS is
shown in Fig. 11.73. The sample cell is placed inside
the resonator of a single-mode argon ion laser, which
delivers the pump beam with ω1. The output beam of
a tunable dye laser is coupled collinearly to the beam
from L1 into the sample cell by the prism. The CARS

CARS spectroscopy is ﬁnding more and more ap-
plications in molecular spectroscopy, in environmen-
tal sciences and also for the solution of technical
problems. First of all it gives information about the
vibrational-rotational structure of molecules for vi-
brational modes that are not accessible to infrared
spectroscopy (Fig. 11.74). Secondly the population dis-
tribution N(v, J) of vibrational-rotational levels can be
inferred from the intensities of the CARS signals. This
allows the determination of the temperature of a gas
with high spatial resolution. One example is the spatial
temperature distribution in ﬂames, which is an indica-
tor of the efﬁciency of chemical reactions in the ﬂame.
Its knowledge can serve for the optimization of the
burning process and the minimization of the emission
of pollutant gases.
The advantages of CARS can be summarized as
follows:
•
The intensity of the anti-Stokes signal is by far
larger than in spontaneous Raman spectroscopy.
•
The spectral resolution is only limited by the band-
width of the two incident lasers. If these are single
mode lasers the resolution is at least two orders
of magnitude higher the for the Doppler-limited
spontaneous Raman spectroscopy.
•
Since the magnitude of the CARS signal is propor-
tional to the product of the intensities of the two
incident lasers the spatial resolution can be opti-
mized by focusing the two laser beams into the
sample.
•
The anti-Stokes wave forms a highly collimated
beam and the detector can therefore be far away
from the interaction region where the sample is
placed. This diminishes spontaneous background,
which is particularly important if spectroscopy in
hot gases (e.g., furnaces) is performed, where the
strong continuous black body radiation overlaps the
signal. The intensity of this background radiation
decreases with the square of the distance from the
sample contrary to the collimated CARS beam.
The disadvantage of CARS is the necessarily large ex-
perimental expenditure with two lasers, which must be
single mode, if the spectral resolution should be in the
sub-Doppler region.
With pulsed lasers time dependent processes in
molecules and their inﬂuence on the change of level
populations can be studied by CARS. One example is
the vibrational distribution and its change with time in
biological molecules after excitation by photons, where
the pathway of energy transfer and isomerization of the
initially excited species can be followed with pico- to
femtosecond resolution. The investigation of these pro-
cesses is, for instance, important for the understanding
of photosynthesis or of the visual process in our eyes
and of the different steps of energy transfer from the
photoexcitation of the antenna molecules in retina cells
to the electrical pulse transmitted to the brain [11.38].
11.7 Spectroscopy
with Synchrotron Radiation
Most processes induced by visible light involve exci-
tation of valence electrons of atoms or molecules. In
order to excite inner shell electrons into free places in

464
11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
outer shells, ultraviolet or even X-ray photons are nec-
essary. This inner shell excitation of molecules often
results in fragmentation of the molecules. The investi-
gation of the different fragments and their energies as
a function of the excitation energy gives valuable infor-
mation on the coupling between inner shell electrons
(which generally do not contribute to the molecular
binding) and electrons in binding orbitals.
In atomic physics the calculations of electron en-
ergies in inner shells require relativistic corrections,
and correlation effects are much more dominant than
in valence shells.
For a long time, intense radiation sources were
missing in this spectral range. With the development of
synchrotrons and storage rings this deﬁciency has been
removed and the number of experiments in atomic and
molecular physics using synchrotron radiation sources
has vastly increased.
The basic physics of synchrotron radiation can be
explained by relativistic electrodynamics. Every accel-
erated charged particle emits radiation (see Sect. 7.5.1).
In a synchrotron, electrons are accelerated to energies
of several GeV (109 eV) and circulate with velocities
close to the velocity of light (v ≈c) in an evacuated
ring stabilized by a magnetic ﬁeld. The intensity and

depend on the number of circulating electrons,
their energy and the radius of curvature of their path. In
Fig. 11.75 the spectral distributions for the synchrotron
radiation of a single electron are given for different
energies of the electron and for a radius R = 31.7 m
(which is the radius of the storage ring DORIS in
Hamburg). This demonstrates that, e.g., for electron
energies of 4 GeV the maximum of the spectral distri-
bution lies at λ = 0.1 nm, i.e., in the X-ray region, but
extends from 0.02–100 nm. The synchrotron radiation
covers the whole region from the extreme UV into the
near UV and even up to the visible range.
Typical currents in storage rings are about 1A,
which corresponds to 6 × 1018 electrons passing
through a cross section of the ring per second.
At these highly relativistic energies the synchrotron
radiation is emitted from any point along the ring in-
to a small solid angle around the tangent to the ring

monochromatic synchrotron radiation with tunable wave-
length for absorption and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy
(Fig. 11.76). It is concentrated in the plane of the ring
and is mainly polarized parallel to this plane, while
a weaker component emitted under a small angle ψ
against the plane, is polarized perpendicular to the
plane.
For most experiments the broad spectral continu-
um of the synchrotron radiation has to be dispersed by
a monochromator. The narrow beam of the synchrotron
radiation is focused by a torodial mirror onto the en-
trance lit of the monochromator (Fig. 11.77). A spher-
ical grating (Rowland grating) acts as a wavelength
disperser and focusses the desired wavelength of the
diffracted radiation onto the exit slit. Turning the grat-
ing tunes the wavelength that is imaged onto the exit
slit. Most experiments (e.g., absorption or excitation
spectroscopy) are performed with this monochromized
radiation behind the primary monochromator.
11.8 Electron Spectroscopy
Detailed investigations of collisions between electrons
and atoms provide important information about the
energy levels of atoms and the basic mechanisms in
gas discharges or in stellar atmospheres where such
collisions play a major role. In fact, one of the ﬁrst ex-
periments to prove the quantum-theoretical model of
discrete energy eigenstates of atoms was the Franck–
Hertz experiment (Sect. 3.4.4). Studies of collisions
between electrons and molecules serve to measure the
electron distribution in molecules and to prove orbital
models of theoretical chemistry. In particular, exchange
effects and the correlation between electrons can be
tested when spin-polarized electrons are used as col-
lision partners. Furthermore polarization effects in the
electron shell of atoms and molecules due to the in-
teraction between the incident electron and the atomic
electrons can be determined by such experiments.
11.8.1 Experiments on Electron Scattering
When an electron collides with an atom, it can be
elastically scattered or it can loose energy by inelastic
collisions or through electron impact ionization.
In elastic collisions only the direction of the elec-
tron momentum p is changed, its amount |p| remains
constant. The momentum transfer depends on the in-
teraction potential between electron and atom (see

466
11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
Sect. 2.8). If the impact parameter b is larger than the
radius of the atomic electron shell, the interaction po-
tential is that between an induced dipole moment (due
to the polarization of the electron cloud) and a nega-
tive charge (Fig. 11.78) and is therefore proportional to
R−4 (Sect. 9.4). For smaller impact parameters, the in-
teraction potential is more complicated and depends on
the radial electron distribution in the atom.
For inelastic collisions, atoms or molecules are ex-
cited into higher energy levels. This excitation can be
determined by measuring the energy loss of the col-
liding electron or by detecting the ﬂuorescence emitted
from the excited levels (Franck–Hertz experiment). For
sufﬁciently high energies of the incident electrons,
single or even double ionization can occur:
e−+ A →A+ + 2e−,
(11.110)
e−+ A →A++ + 3e−.
The most detailed information can be obtained when
the highest possible energy resolution is achieved. This
demands, that all incident electrons have the same
energy.
Since electrons emitted from a hot cathode have
a thermal velocity distribution they have to be
monochromized. This can be performed by a cylindri-
cal electrostatic energy selector (Sect. 2.6.3).
All electrons passing through a slit behind the en-
ergy selector (Fig. 11.79), where the two condensor
plates have radii of curvatures R1 and R2 have a kinetic
energy (see Sect. 2.6.3 and problem 2.15)

The experimental arrangement for electron scatter-
ing experiments is illustrated in Fig. 11.80. The ﬂuo-
rescence, emitted from the excited atoms, which cross
the electron beam in an atomic beam perpendicular to
the scattering plane, is monitored by a photomultiplier.
The monochromized incident electrons, scattered by an
angle ϑ1, enter the entrance slit of a second energy se-
lector and are detected by D1. Measuring the rate of
electrons with a deﬁned energy loss

and scattered by the angle ϑ1 as a function of the kinetic
energy of the incident electrons, yields the differential

as well as inelastic collisions with any energy loss ΔE.
For ionizing collisions

a third energy selector is installed that monitors the
second electron scattered by the angle ϑ2 and its ki-
netic energy E(2)
kin. The two electrons are measured in
coincidence. This means that both detectors give an
output signal only if the two signals appear at the same
time, i.e., in a time interval Δt around a time t0. The
energy E2 of the second electron is determined by the
ionization energy Eion of the atom and by the ener-
gies E0 of the incident electron and E1 of the other
scattered electron. Energy conservation demands that
E0 = Eion + E1 + E2 .

They are experimentally very difﬁcult but give, on the
other hand, the most detailed information on the ion-
ization process, because they show at which impact
parameter the ionization probability becomes maxi-
mum and what inﬂuence the electrostatic interaction
between the two electrons after the collision has on the
angular distribution of the two electrons. For illustra-
tion, the measured angular distributions N1(E1, ϑ1) and
N2(E2, ϑ2) of the two electrons for the electron impact
ionization of helium atoms is shown in Fig. 11.81. The
two electrons are detected in nearly opposite directions
(partly due to the post-collision Coulomb interaction).
The angular width of the distributions give information
on the momentum distribution of the atomic electron
before the collision.
11.8.2 Photoelectron Spectroscopy
When
atoms
or
molecules
are
irradiated
with
monochromatic light of frequency ν, a photoelec-
tron can be emitted if the photon energy hν is larger
than the ionization energy
hν + M →M+ + e−(Ekin)
(11.113)
with kinetic energy
Ekin = hν −(Eion + E(M+∗)) .
(11.114)
The ion M+ can be in its ground state or in bound exci-
ted states M+∗(Ei) (Fig. 11.82). Measuring the kinetic
energy of the photoelectron produced by the known
photon energy hν allows the determination of discrete
energy levels of the ion M+. The rate of photoelectrons
with kinetic energy Ekin gives information on the prob-
ability of exciting these levels and on its photon energy
dependence.
As an example of photoelectron spectroscopy of
solid metal surfaces, a schematic experimental setup is
shown in Fig. 11.83. The photoelectrons, emitted under
the angle ϑ against the surface normal, are detected af-
ter their energy analysis by a cylindrical electrostatic
energy analyzer. Such measurements give the energy
distribution of the electrons in the metal before the
photon releases them.

For electron spectroscopy of atoms or molecules
in the gas phase, collimated molecular beams that
are crossed perpendicularly by the photon beam are
generally used. The photon energy from a helium dis-
charge lamp that emits a spectral continuum is selected
using a concave grating. In Fig. 11.85 the arrangement
is shown for measuring threshold photoelectrons of
atoms and molecules in a collimated beam. These elec-
trons, with very small kinetic energies are produced by
photons with energy hν, just at the ionization threshold.
Higher energy resolution can be achieved if lasers
are used for photoionization. Since cw lasers in the far
UV for one-photon ionization are not available (unless
frequency doubling of UV-lasers is used), a two-step
excitation is utilized, where an intermediate atomic or
molecular level is excited by the ﬁrst laser and then
ionization is achieved by a second laser. In Fig. 11.86
a modern apparatus for such photoelectron experiments
with two-step excitation is shown [11.42]. The level
scheme explains the situation for potassium atoms.
The slow photoelectrons can attach to other molecules
with a large electron afﬁnity in the crossing volume of
atomic and molecular beams and the resulting nega-
tive ions M−are selected through a quadrupole mass
spectrometer and are imaged onto the detector.

11.8.3 ZEKE Spectroscopy
Over the last years, a modiﬁcation of photoelectron
spectroscopy has been developed, where a tunable laser
excites levels in the molecular ion, but only photoelec-
trons with nearly zero kinetic energy are selected for
detection [11.43]. If the photoexcitation is performed in
a collimated molecular beam the slow photoelectrons
can be collected by a weak electric ﬁeld and imaged
onto the electron detector. This ﬁeld is only switched
on with a delay time Δt after the pulsed excitation at
t = 0. Therefore the levels of the molecular ion are
excited under ﬁeld-free conditions and do not suffer
a Stark shift. The fast photoelectrons have already left

mainly limited by the spectral bandwidth of the pulsed
laser.
In Fig. 11.87 the ZEKE spectrum of ND4 is shown
as a function of the wavenumber of the exciting laser.
The peaks correspond to photoexcitations starting from
different rotational levels in the ground state of the neu-
tral ND4 and reaching the level v′ = 0 J ′ = 0 in the

11.9 Measurements of Magnetic
and Electric Moments
in Atoms and Molecules
Many molecules posses a magnetic dipole moment pm
due to the orbital angular momenta or the spins of
their electrons or due to nuclear spins. In an external
magnetic ﬁeld B they experience a torque
D = pm × B
(11.115)
which tries to orient the molecules in such a way, that
pm is parallel to B, because then the potential energy
Wpot = −pm · B
(11.116)
has a minimum. The mean macroscopic magnetization
of a sample volume with N molecules is
<M> = &pm = N·<·pm >= N · η · pm
(11.117)
where the average magnetic moment <pm>= η · ¯pm
is smaller than pm = |pm| because of the following
reason:
At temperatures T > 0 the orientation of the mole-
cular magnetic moments is partly destroyed by the
thermal motion of the molecules which try to establish
thermal equilibrium, where all orientation are equally
probable. The mean magnetisation of N molecules in
the gas phase is proportional to the ratio

of mean magnetic to mean kinetic energy of the
molecules.
For a rotating molecule the situation is more com-
plex. In the molecular frame the magnetic dipole mo-
ment has a well deﬁned direction determined by the
total electronic angular momentum. For the free ro-
tating molecule the vector pm, precesses around the
space ﬁxed rotational axis, deﬁned by the total an-
gular momentum J. Only the average moment pm =
pm · J which equals the projection of pm onto J is
observed (Fig. 11.88). In an external magnetic ﬁeld the
angular momentum ⃗J and with if the projection ¯pm pre-
cesses around the ﬁeld axis and therefore the average
magnetic potential energy of the molecule is given by

If the centres of the nuclear charges and the elec-
tron charges do not coincide, the molecule possesses an
electric dipole moment pel. Examples are the molecules
HCl. H2O of NaCl, which have either ionic binding or
a strong electric polarisability, which leads to a charge
transfer and a separation of the two centres of charge.
In an external homogeneous electric ﬁeld
E
a torque
D = pel × E
(11.120)
acts on these molecules resulting in a potential energy
Wpot = −pel · E .
(11.121)
In inhomogeneous magnetic or electric ﬁelds addition-
al forces
Fm = pm · grad B
and
Fel = pel · grad E
(11.122)
are present, which try to pull the molecules into the di-
rection of either strong or weak ﬁelds, depending on
the Zeeman- or Stark levels (J, M) of the molecule.
These magnetic or electric moments of molecules
have great importance for scientiﬁc and technical ap-
plications. Examples are the orientation of molecules
in liquid crystals which inﬂuences the optical transmis-
sion or reﬂection of these devices, the nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy and its application in biology
and medicine, or the adiabatic demagnetisation used
for reaching extremely low temperatures. It is therefore
of great interest to study these moments in more detail.
11.9.1 The Rabi-Method
of Radio-Frequency Spectroscopy
Isidor Isaac Rabi (1898–1988) developed a molecu-
lar beam method for the precision measurements of
magnetic or electric moments or of hyperﬁne splittings
in atoms or molecules [11.45]. He received for this
ingenious technique the Nobel prize in 1944. The prin-
ciple of his technique is represented in Fig. 11.89. The
atoms or molecules effuse from the reservoir R through
a small hole H into the vacuum chamber. After they

have been collimated by the slit S1 they pass through
an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld A where they are
deﬂected by the force F = pm · grad B. In the fol-
lowing homogeneous ﬁeld C they do not experience
a force but the projection (pm)z of their magnetic mo-
ment is quantized, i.e. it can only take discrete values
m · g j · μB · B where μB is the Bohr-magneton (see
Sect. 5.2). The Zeeman energies of the molecules in
this ﬁeld are
EM = E0 + m · g j|pm| · |B|/
$
J(J + 1)
−m ≤J ≤+m.
(11.123)
In the following inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld B,
which is opposite to the ﬁeld in A the molecules ex-
perience the opposite force as in A and are deﬂected
back onto the detector behind a slit S2.
Now a radio-frequency is fed through a hole into the
region of the homogeneous ﬁeld C. If its frequency ν
matches the Zeeman splitting Δν = gJ|pm| · |B|/h, it
induces transitions between the Zeeman-components
which changes their population. This results in a dif-
ferent deﬂection in the inhomogeneous ﬁeld B because
the deﬂecting force F depends on the magnitude and
the direction of the magnetic moment which are dif-
ferent for the different m-levels. The molecules can-
not pass through the slit S2 and the signal decreases
(Fig. 11.89b).
A modern version of the Rabi-method replaces the
two inhomogeneous ﬁelds A and B by two laser beams
(Fig. 11.89c), which cross the molecular beam perpen-
dicular [11.46]. The laser frequency is tuned to the
wanted transition ⟨k| →⟨i|. For sufﬁciently high laser

11.9. Measurements of Magnetic and Electric Moments in Atoms and Molecules
473
intensities the transition can be readily saturated, i.e.
the population of the absorbing level decreases (only
a few milliwatts, focussed into the molecular beam,
are sufﬁcient). This saturation causes a decrease of the
absorption of the second laser beam from the same
laser and the laser-induced ﬂuorescence in the crossing
point 2 decreases. If the molecules are irradiated bet-
ween the two crossing points by a radio-or microwave,
which induces transitions from other levels into the
depleted level, its population increases again and the
signal in point 2 becomes larger. Measuring the sig-
nal as a function of the radio-frequency allows the
determination of levels splittings between hyperﬁne-
levels or rotational levels with a very high accuracy.
The linewidth of these signals is mainly limited by the
interaction time of the molecules with the rf-ﬁeld, ie.
by their transit time through the rf-ﬁeld region.
The Rabi-Method is the basis of the cesium atom-
ic clock (Fig. 11.90). The cesium atoms emerge from
an oven through a narrow hole into the vacuum. The
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds A and B are realized
by sixpole magnets which acts as magnetic lenses. The
ﬁeld A focuses the divergent atomic beam into the cen-
tre of a microwave resonator located between A and B
and the ﬁeld B refocuses the beam onto the detector.
The microwave resonator is tuned to a transition be-
tween the hyperﬁne components F = 3 and F = 4 in
the 2S1/2 state of the cesium atom 133Cs at a frequency
of ν = 9.192 GHz. Since the magnetic moment is dif-
ferent for the two hfs-levels the deﬂection in the B-ﬁeld
changes when a transition took place in the microwave
cavity. A feedback signal delivered from the detector
keeps the microwave frequency always at the centre of
the hyperﬁne-transition. Both, the classical and its laser
version are used and are compared with regard to the
optimum frequency stability which reaches a relative
standard deviation of Δν/ν = 10−13. Up to now this
cesium atomic clock provides the primary frequency
and time standard. It might be, however, soon replaced
by more stable laser devices.
11.9.2 Stark-Spectroscopy
The levels of atoms or molecules with a permanent
electric dipole moment split in an electric ﬁeld in-
to (2J + 1) Stark-components, where J is the total
angular momentum quantum number of the level.

Without external ﬁeld the total angular momen-
tum J has a constant magnitude and a constant orien-
tation. If the direction of pel does not coincide with
the direction of J, the electric dipole moment pel
precesses in the rotating molecule around J and the
time-averaged component is, according to Fig. 11.91

(11.124)
where K · ¯h is the projection of J onto the sym-
metry axis of the molecule which for symmetric
top molecules coincides with the direction of pel
(Fig. 11.91a). In an external electric ﬁeld E the dipole
moment pel precesses around the ﬁeld direction and
therefore also J precesses with a constant projection
M · ¯h onto the ﬁeld direction.

is proportional to the electric ﬁeld E (linear Stark-
effect).
For a diatomic molecule the electric dipole mo-
ment points into the direction of the internuclear axis.
Without electronic angular momentum the rotational
angular momentum J is perpendicular to this axis,
which means that K = 0 and therefore ⟨pel⟩= 0.
For diatomic molecules in 1Σ states there is no
linear Stark-shift, even if they posses a perma-
nent electric dipole moment.
There is, however, a second order effect. When the
electric dipole rotates in the electric ﬁeld, its poten-
tial energy is periodically changing and therefore the

474
11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
rotation is no longer uniform. The rotation is slower
for positions where the potential energy is maximum.
Therefore the average energy differs from that of the
ﬁeld-free case. There is a Stark-shift of second order
which is proportional to the square E2 of the electric
ﬁeld.
Even without a permanent electric dipole moment
the electric ﬁeld can polarise the charge distribution in
the molecule which results for a non-rotating molecule
in an induced electric moment

el = ˜α · E ,
(11.126)
where ˜α is the tensor of the molecular polarizability,
which is a measure of the displacements of the charges
from their equilibrium positions and generally depends
on the direction against the molecular frame. Therefore
pind
el generally does not point into the same direction as
the electric ﬁeld, but forms the angle β against E and
processes around the ﬁeld direction.
Now the energy shift is

(11.127)
which means that the Stark-shift is proportional to the

In Fig. 11.92 the quadratic Stark-shift is illustrat-
ed by the example of the excited levels 3 2P3/2, 3 2P1/2
and the ground state level 3 2S1/2 in the sodium atom.

the amount |M|. Therefore only the level P3/2 splits
into two Stark components, while the other two levels
32 S1/2 and 32 P1/2 with J = 1/2 are only shifted but
do not split.
Measurements of the line-shifts as a function of
E2 give a straight line (Fig. 11.92b), which proves the
quadratic Stark-effect. Since the Stark-shift is small-
er in the 2S1/2 state as in the P-states. The Stark-
components of the transitions are therefore shifted
towards smaller frequencies.
From the measurement of the Stark shifts the polar-
isability α can be obtained according to (11.127). As
was outlined in Sect. 9.4.3 α is responsible for the van-
der-Waals binding of molecules at large internuclear
distances and inﬂuences many macroscopic properties
of matter, such as the melting temperature of van-der
Waals-solids or the viscosity of noble gases.
The experimental arrangement can be that of the
Rabi-method where the magnetic ﬁelds are replaced
by electric ﬁelds [11.47]. For Doppler-limited spec-
troscopy also absorption cells can be used with elec-
trodes on the side-walls for producing the electric
ﬁeld.
Instead of tuning the laser frequency across the tran-
sitions between Stark-components the laser frequency
can be kept constant and the Stark ﬁeld is tuned un-
til the the laser frequency is in resonance between an
optical transition between the Stark-components in the
lower and upper level [11.48].
11.10 Investigations of Atomic
and Molecular Collisions
Detailed studies of elastic, inelastic and reactive col-
lisions between atoms and molecules have made an
important contribution to our understanding of the
structure of atoms and molecules, the interaction po-
tential between the collision partners and of the mi-
croscopic process of chemical reactions. One example
is the development of the Rutherford model of the
atom (Sect. 2.8), which was derived from the re-
sults of experiments on scattering α particles by gold
atoms. These experiments proved for the ﬁrst time that
most of the atomic mass is concentrated in the very
small volume of the atomic nucleus. Another exam-
ple is the study of inelastic collisions of electrons with
atoms in the Franck–Hertz experiment (Sect. 3.4.4),

11.10. Investigations of Atomic and Molecular Collisions
475
which proved the discrete level structure of atoms and
conﬁrmed Bohr’s atomic model.
Because of their importance for basic physics and
in applications, an essential part of experimental ef-
forts in atomic and molecular physics has been devoted
to the investigation of collision processes. This can
be seen from the fact that there are several important
biannual international conference series on atomic and
molecular collisions [11.49].
11.10.1 Elastic Scattering
When a parallel beam of particles A with particle ﬂux
˙NA (number of particles per cm2 per second) passes
into the x direction through a volume V ﬁlled with
particles B of density nB (Fig. 11.93) the ﬂux ˙NA has
decreased after a path length x = d through the volume
ﬁlled with particles B to
˙NA(x = d) = ˙NA(x = 0)e−nB·σint·d
(11.128)
(see Sect. 2.8.1). The quantity σint is the integral elas-
tic collision cross section. The ratio of σint to the cross
section q of the incident parallel beam describes the
probability that a particle A is scattered by one parti-
cle B out of the beam, i.e., that it is deﬂected by an
angle ϑ > ϑmin and cannot reach the detector behind
the aperture S. This illustrates that the measured inte-
gral scattering cross section not only depends on the
interaction potential, but also on the angular resolution
ϑmin of the apparatus. For ϑmin = 0, the classical inte-
gral cross section σint would become inﬁnite because
ϑ
S
Fig. 11.93. Attenuation of a parallel beam of particles A after
passing through a scattering volume with particle density nB
collisions with zero scattering angles, i.e., inﬁnite im-
pact parameters b would contribute to it.
In the quantum mechanical model ϑmin cannot
become zero and therefore the maximum impact pa-
rameter bmax(ϑmin) remains ﬁnite. This can be seen as
follows.
In the center-of-mass system the two colliding par-
ticles can be replaced by one particle with the reduced
mass μ moving in the spherically symmetric poten-
tial that equals the interaction potential between the
two particles (Sect. 2.8.2). For elastic collisions the
momentum does not change its amount but only its di-
rection. For small deﬂection angles we have the relation
(Fig. 11.94)
⃗ϑ ≈tan ϑ = Δp
p = bΔp
bp
= |ΔL|
|L| ,
(11.129)
where |L| = bμv = n¯h is the orbital angular momen-
tum of the particle with mass μ, velocity v and impact
parameter b, which has to be an integer multiple of ¯h.
Therefore the minimum value of ΔL is ΔLmin = ¯h.
This gives the minimum deﬂection angle
ϑmin =
¯h
bmaxμv =
λdB
2πbmax
,
(11.130)
where λDB = h/(μv) is the de Broglie wavelength.
With ϑmin > 0 a maximum impact parameter bmax is
determined and the integral cross section σint = πb2
max
remains ﬁnite.
The smallest scattering angle is therefore de-
termined by the ratio of the de Broglie wave-
length λDB to the maximum impact parameter
bmax.

11. Experimental Techniques in Atomic and Molecular Physics
In Equation (2.109) a relation between scattering
angle ϑ and potential interaction energy Epot(R) was
given. For large impact parameters the path of the par-
ticle is only slightly bent and we can approximate the
closest distance rmin by rmin = b. Under these condi-
tions the interaction energy Epot is very small com-
pared to the initial kinetic energy Ekin(∞) = E0. When
we expand for Epot/E0 ≪1 the square root under the
integral in (2.142) we obtain the result
ϑmin(bmax) = λDB

one can therefore derive the constant Cn and the expo-

The measurements can be done with the appara-
tus shown in Fig. 11.95, where two beams of particles
A and B cross each other perpendicularly. The scatter-
ing volume V is deﬁned by the overlap region of the
two beams. The minimum scattering angle of particle A
is determined by the distance d between scattering vol-
ume and aperture B2 and the slit width b2 of B2 in front
of the detector. The velocity v of the relative movement

mounted on the same axis. The principle of the ve-
locity selector can be illustrated by Fig. 11.96, which
shows the simpliﬁed version consisting of two discs
with radius R and slits of width s in a distance a. If
the angular displacement of the two slits is ϕ and the
rotational angular speed of the discs is ω, only parti-
cles are transmitted through both slits of the rotating
discs for which the ﬂight time T = a/v equals the
time Rϕ/(Rω) = ϕ/ω. The velocity of these particles
is then
v = a · ω/ϕ .
(11.134a)
The width Δv of the transmitted velocity interval is
given by the angular width Δϕ of the two slits
Δv = v(Δϕ/ϕ) .
(11.134b)
More information about the interaction potential at
smaller distances is obtained from measurements of
differential cross sections as was already outlined for
the Rutherford scattering in Sect. 2.8.6.
Similarly to Fig. 11.95, two crossed molecular
beams are used (Fig. 11.97). The difference is that
now only molecules scattered into the solid angle ΔΩ
around the deﬂection angle ϑ are received by the detec-
tor, while in measurements of the integral cross section
the attenuation of the incident beam is determined,
which is a measure for the total number of scattered
particles integrated over all scattering angles from ϑmin
to ϑ = 180◦.
There is a problem for nonmonotonic potentials,
such as the Lenard–Jones potential (9.67), where dif-
ferent impact parameters b1 and b2 can lead to the same

scattering angle ϑ. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.98. At
the internuclear distances r1 and r2 the slopes of the
potential have equal magnitude but opposite sign. The
forces F = −grad Epot are therefore equal in mag-
nitude, but F1 is repulsive and F2 is attractive. Two
particles A with impact parameters b1 and b2 approach-
ing on opposite sides of the line b = 0 are scattered into
the same direction ϑ.
In such cases it can not be decided which of the two
impact parameters has contributed to the measured sig-
nal and therefore the superposition of the probability
amplitudes has to be considered (see Sect. 3.5.2). This
leads to interference effects because the two possibil-
ities correspond to two different paths of the particles
through the potential and their de Broglie wavelengths
are therefore shifted in a different way, which results in
different phase shifts ϕn.
The intensity of the de Broglie wave scattered by
the deﬂection angle ϑ is
I(ϑ) ∝|A1(b1, ϕ1) + A2(b2, ϕ2)|2 ,
(11.135)
where the Ai are the amplitudes of the scattered waves.
The intensity I(ϑ) shows interference maxima and
minima, which are produced in a similar way as the
refraction and reﬂection of light by raindrops resulting
in the observation of the rainbow.
Therefore the interference effects in the differential
cross section are called rainbow scattering.

Fig. 11.98. Interference effects for scattering in a nonmono-
tonic potential where different impact parameters b can lead
to identical deﬂection angles ϑ
In Fig. 11.99 the deﬂection function ϑ(b) for a non-
monotonic potential is illustrated, showing three im-
pact parameters b1, b2, and b3 leading to the same
values of |ϑ|. Since the scattering is symmetric around
the axis b = 0, the differential cross sections σ(ϑ) =
σ(−ϑ) must be equal.
According to (2.147) the differential cross section is
proportional to db/dϑ = (dϑ/db)−1, i.e., to the inverse
slope of the deﬂection function ϑ(b). In the classical
model dσ/dΩ should become inﬁnite for b = br and
b = 0. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the im-
pact parameters are only deﬁned with an uncertainty
that equals the de Broglie wavelength. Therefore there
are only maxima instead of inﬁnite poles in the scatter-
ing cross section (Fig. 11.99c).

these rainbow maxima and their dependence on the en-

wavelength) gives very detailed information of the radi-
al dependence of the interaction potential, because the
phase differences are very sensitive against changes of
Epot(r) [11.50].
11.10.2 Inelastic Scattering
During the inelastic collision of a particle A with a par-
ticle B part of the kinetic energy of A is transferred into
internal energy of B. If B is an atom, this is electronic
excitation energy, if B is a molecule, the internal energy
may be rotational, vibrational or electronic energy
A(Ekin) + B(Ei) →A + B(Ef) + ΔEkin (11.136)
with ΔEkin = Ef(B) −Ei(B)
The collision induces in the target particle B a tran-
sition from the initial internal energy Ei to a ﬁnal
state with energy Ef, where we have assumed that the
internal state of A has not changed.
The probability for this inelastic process depends on
the interaction potential between A and B, on the im-
pact parameter b and on the relative kinetic energy of
the collision partners. If all of these parameters should
be included in the experimental investigation, one has
to know the initial kinetic energy, the initial and ﬁ-
nal internal energies Ei and Ef of particle B and the
impact parameter, i.e., the scattering angle ϑ. Such
a scattering experiment can be called an ideal experi-
ment, because is allows the determination of all wanted
details [11.52]. A possible experimental arrangement
for such a detailed experiment, which combines the
method of laser spectroscopy with molecular beam
techniques [11.53] is shown in Fig. 11.100.
The molecules A pass before the collision region
through the beam of laser L1 (pump laser), which in-
duces a transition |i⟩→|k⟩in the molecule. Already
with moderate laser powers the transition can be sat-
urated and the initial level |i⟩can be nearly com-
pletely depopulated. The molecules are scattered in the
crossing volume with a beam of particles B. Those
molecules A, deﬂected by the angle ϑ which is de-
ﬁned by an aperture in front of the detector, are excited
by a second laser L2 on the transition | f ⟩→| j⟩. The
k

tions by laser excitation before and after the collision [11.46]

11.10. Investigations of Atomic and Molecular Collisions

laser-induced ﬂuorescence is collected with careful-
ly designed optics and imaged by a ﬁber bundle onto
a photomultiplier. The photomultiplier output signal S
is a measure for the population Nf of the scattered
particles.
If the pump laser L1 is periodically chopped the
population Ni is modulated at the chopping frequency.
The probe laser L2 now measures the difference ΔS =
S(L1 on) −S(L1 off). The difference of the signals
gives the rate of those molecules that are deﬂected
by the angle ϑ and have been transferred during the
collision from level |i⟩to level | f ⟩.
Measuring the dependence ΔS(ϑ) gives direct in-
formation on the dependence of the inelastic cross
section on the impact parameter and tells us which part
of the potential has the largest inﬂuence on inducing the
transition. They teach us, for instance, which impact
parameters mainly contribute to rotational or vibra-
tional energy transfer, or how the initial internal energy
of one collision partner inﬂuences the probability of
a collision-induced transition [11.51–53].
11.10.3 Reactive Scattering
In Sect. 10.7 chemical reactions were described by rate
equations, which give the macroscopic picture of these
reactions averaged over a large number of reaction part-
ners. On the molecular scale, these reactions are the
result of many individual molecular collisions, e.g.,
AB + C →AC + B
AB + CD →AC + BD .
(11.137)
The probability of such reactive collisions depends
on the relative kinetic energy, on the internal energy
of the reactants (for instance the vibrational energy
of AB) and on the interaction potential. Since the inter-
action potential is generally not spherically symmetric,
steric effects may play an essential role, i.e., the re-
action probability may strongly depend on the relative
orientation of the reacting molecules.
Often a reaction takes place only if the kinetic ener-
gy exceeds a threshold (reaction barrier), which in turn
can depend on the internal energy of the reactants.
For the experimental investigation of reactive colli-
sions the rate of reaction products B or AC, scattered
by the angle ϑ, are measured as a function of the ini-
tial relative kinetic energy of the reactants. This gives
the differential reaction cross section dσ/dΩ. The in-
tegration over all scattering angles yields the integral
cross section σtotal(v) as a function of the relative ve-
locity of the collision partners. The velocity-dependent
rate reaction is related to the integral cross section by
R(AB + C →AC + B) = k(2)
R nAB · nC
= v · σtot(v) · nAB · nC
where the second order rate constant k(2)
R (v) is

These reaction constants introduced in Sect. 10.7
for reactions in gas cells are mean values, averaged
over the thermal distribution of the relative velocity of
the reaction partners. They can be calculated from the
measured cross sections.
The reaction constant k(i →f ) for the reaction

state | f ⟩of the reaction product

velocity but also on the direction of v.
For spherical symmetric potentials σi→f does not
depend on the direction of v. Integration of the solid

AB–C · exp(−E0/kBT )
The reaction constant grows exponentially with ris-
ing temperature T . The experimental technique used
for the investigation of reactive collisions depends on
the kind of reaction partners. In early experiments,
reactions involving alkali atoms were mostly studied
because they can be readily and efﬁciently detect-
ed by Langmuir–Taylor detectors. These are heated
tungsten wires that have an electron work function
which is higher than the ionization energy of the al-
kali atoms. If an alkali atom hits the wire it becomes
ionized because the electron gains more energy when
it is captured in the conduction band than is neces-
sary to remove it from the alkali atom. The alkali ions
evaporate from the hot wire and are accelerated by an
electric ﬁeld onto a Faraday cup or an electron mul-
tiplier. Meanwhile the detection techniques have been
improved, using laser-induced ﬂuorescence for state-
speciﬁc detection of atoms or molecules. Therefore
reactive scattering experiments in crossed beams have
been extended to a larger variety of different collision
parameters [11.54]
11.11 Time-Resolved Measurements
of Atoms and Molecules
While free atoms or molecules are stable in their
ground states, they decay in higher energy states either
by emission of ﬂuorescence (radiative transitions) or
by collision-induced deactivation processes (radiation-
less transitions). If collisions transfer the atom into its
ground state, the ﬂuorescence intensity is diminished
and the collisions are called quenching collisions.
In molecules, the excitation energy can be trans-
ferred even in the absence of collisions to other excited
levels (for instance, high-lying vibrational levels in
the electronic ground state) if these levels are coupled
to the initially-excited level. Such an internal energy
transfer can result in isomerization or fragmentation of
the molecule.
All these time-dependent processes ﬁt into the area
of molecular dynamics. For experimental investiga-
tions, time-resolving techniques are demanded, where
the necessary time resolution ranges from milliseconds
down to femtoseconds.
We will present here some techniques that have
already been used for quite some time. The latest ex-
perimental developments of producing and measuring
ultrafast laser pulses and their applications to molecular
dynamics will be left to the next chapter.
11.11.1 Lifetime Measurements
If atoms or molecules are excited by a short pulse (light
pulse or electron pulse) into an energetically higher
state Ei, the population Ni(t) decays due to emission
of radiation or to inelastic collisions. In Sect. 7.3 we
saw that the time-dependent population is given by
Ni(t) = Ni(0) · e−t/τeff .

Since the total ﬂuorescence rate Rﬂ= Ni Ai is propor-
tional to the population Ni, its time dependence follows
the same equation as (11.143), and the measurement
of the time-dependent ﬂuorescence yields the effective
lifetime τeff of level ⟨i|. Its dependence on the den-
sity nB of collision partners allows the determination
of the inelastic total cross section. The extrapolation
to nB = 0 gives the spontaneous lifetime τspont of
level ⟨i|.

The short light pulses for the excitation of lev-
el ⟨i| in the spectral range from 400–2000 nm are
delivered by pulsed lasers, where the UV range with
λ < 400 nm is generally covered by optical frequency
doubling of visible lasers. In the spectral range below
200 nm, pulses of synchrotron radiation from electron
storage rings are available with pulse widths of a few
picoseconds.
The experimental technique for measuring lifetimes
depends on the desired time resolution and the wanted
repetition rate of the excitation pulses.
For a time resolution Δt > 10−9 s and a pulse repe-
tition rate f < 103 s−1 the apparatus required is shown
schematically in Fig. 11.101. A pulsed laser excites the
molecules in a cell and the laser-induced ﬂuorescence
is imaged onto the photomultiplier. The output pulse of
the photomultiplier is ampliﬁed and delivered to a fast
oscilloscope, where it can be directly viewed.
Another technique uses a gated integrator. Here,
several time intervals tn + Δt with Δt ≪τ are select-
ed by controllable electronic gates (Fig. 11.102). The
output signal of the n-th gate is proportional to the
intensity of the ﬂuorescence
I(t, Δt) = 1

(11.147)
⇒ln I(t1, Δt)

A more accurate technique (Fig. 11.103a) uses cw
radiation for excitation, modulated at the frequency Ω.

arrangement and (b) equivalent electric network
where the constant b ∝N0σ0i ILV depends on the den-
sity N0 of molecules in the absorbing level ⟨0|, the
absorption cross section σ0i, the laser intensity IL and
the excitation volume V , seen by the ﬂuorescence
detector.
Equation (11.150) shows that the emitted ﬂuo-
rescence is modulated at the same frequency Ω as
the exciting laser radiation but has a phase shift ϕ
(Fig. 11.103b) that is related to the lifetime τ by
tan ϕ = Ωτ .
(11.151)
The mathematically equivalent problem is represent-
ed by the electronic circuit in Fig. 11.103c, where
an ac input voltage Uin(t) = U0 · cos Ωt generates an
output voltage Uout(t) = U1 · cos(Ωt −ϕ). The output
voltage has the same mathematical form as the ﬂuores-
cence intensity if one substitutes the mean lifetime τ
by the time constant RC with R = R1R2/(R1 + R2)
and the laser intensity I(t) by the input current Iin(t) =
(Uin −Uout)/R1.
With a cw mode-locked laser, pulse widths of a few
picoseconds can be achieved with repetition rates of
several MHz. The energy of each pulse is small, in
particular, if optical frequency doubling has to be
used in order to obtain wavelengths in the UV re-
gion. Therefore only a few molecules are excited per
pulse and the detection probability for a ﬂuorescence
photon per excitation pulse is small compared to one.
In such a case the single photon counting technique,
shown in Fig. 11.104, is preferable. The photomultipli-
er detects single ﬂuorescence photons, which produce
electric output pulses that are ampliﬁed and fed into
a time-to-amplitude converter. This device generates
a fast voltage ramp U(t) = U0(t −t0) that is start-
ed by the excitation pulse at time t0 and stopped by
the ﬂuorescence pulse at time t = t1. The output volt-
age U(t1) = U0(t1 −t0) is formed into a pulse with

Fig. 11.104. Schematic diagram for lifetime measurements
using single photon counting with a time-to-pulse height
converter and a multichannel analyzer
amplitude U(t1), which is stored in a multichannel ana-
lyzer where the different pulses are sorted into different
channels according to their amplitude. Each channel
corresponds to a deﬁnite time difference Δt = t1 −t0.
The number of pulses stored in channel n is propor-
tional to the ﬂuorescence intensity at time tn, because
the probability P(t)Δt that a ﬂuorescence photon from
a single atom is emitted during the time interval from t
to t + Δt,
P(t)Δt = I(t)Δt/

is proportional to the number of ﬂuorescence photons
emitted in the same time interval by many atoms that
have all been excited at the same time. The amplitude
distribution of the pulses in the multichannel analyzer
N(U)ΔU = ae−t/τeff
(11.153)
directly gives the decay curve of the excited molecules.
The technique is called single photon counting
with delayed coincidence, because for each exciting
laser pulse the corresponding ﬂuorescence photon, de-
layed by the time t, is detected coincidentally [11.55].
Fig. 11.105. Pump-and-probe technique
For very high time resolution in the pico- and
femto-second range, electronic detectors are not fast
enough. Here a pump-probe techniques can be used.
A short pump pulse at time t = 0 excites the sample
into a deﬁnite level |i⟩, which decays over the course
of time. A second weak probe pulse with variable
delay Δt against the pump pulse interrogates the pop-
ulation of the decaying level (Fig. 11.105). This can be
realized in different ways. If the probe pulse can ionize
the molecules in the excited level |i⟩, the number of de-
tected ions as a function of the delay time Δt is directly
proportional to the number Ni(Δt). Another way of
monitoring the time-dependent population Ni(t) uses
the total ﬂuorescence emitted from a level | j⟩, excited
by the probe laser on the transition |i⟩→| j⟩. Its in-
tensity Iﬂ(Δt) measured as a function of the delay time
Δt is again proportional to the population Ni. In many
cases the stimulated emission induced by the probe
pulse on a downward transition from |i⟩to lover lev-
els |m⟩, which is proportional to (Ni(Δt) −Nm) can be
utilized as a monitor. If Nm = 0, the intensity of stim-
ulated emission is again proportional to Ni(Δt). With
these pump and probe techniques, a time resolution in
the femtosecond range can be achieved, even when the
detector has a much lower time constant.

11.11.2 Fast Relaxation Processes
in Atoms and Molecules
The time resolved nonradiative relaxation of a level
caused by collisions can be used for the determina-
tion of collision cross sections and reaction rates. Here
the pump and probe techniques can be also applied
to levels in the electronic ground state, where no ﬂu-
orescence is emitted and therefore some of the other
techniques do not work. In Fig. 11.106 the principle is
shown for measuring the relaxation of vibrational lev-
els in the electronic ground state of molecules. A short
pulse from the pump laser tuned to a transition |k⟩→
|i⟩depletes the lower level |k⟩of molecules in a gas
cell. Collisions with other atoms or molecules reﬁll it
again, because they try to reestablish thermal equilib-
rium. The ﬂuorescence intensity Iﬂ(Δt), induced by
the pulse of the probe laser on a transition |k⟩→| j⟩
is measured as a function of the delay time between
pump and probe pulse. This intensity is proportional to
the population Ni(Δt). It is a measure for the total in-
elastic collision rates for energy transfer from all other
levels into level |i⟩.
The individual contributions of collision rates for
population transfer from a speciﬁc level |m⟩into lev-
el |k⟩can also be measured with a slight modiﬁcation.
Now the probe laser is tuned to a transition |m⟩→| j⟩.
The ﬂuorescence Iﬂgives the time-dependent popula-
tion of level |m⟩. The ratio of ΔNm/ΔNk yields the
relative contribution of the speciﬁc collision-induced
transition |m⟩→|k⟩to the total reﬁlling rate of
level |k⟩.
Fig. 11.106. Level scheme and time-dependent level popula-
tions when a short pump laser pulses depletes level |k⟩, which
is reﬁlled by collisional transfer from other levels
The pump-probe technique with ultrashort pulses
from femtosecond lasers has an increasing number of
applications. Some of them will be discussed in the
next chapter.

•
There are three principal methods for the inves-
tigation of the structure and dynamics of atoms,
molecules and their intermolecular interactions.
These are:
−Spectroscopic techniques
−Scattering experiments
−Investigation of macroscopic phenomena, such
as transport properties of gases, and measure-
ments of the virial coefﬁcients in the equation
of state for real gases
•
In spectroscopic experiments the sources of infor-
mation are wavelengths, intensities, polarization
properties and spectral proﬁles of absorption and
emission lines, which allow the determination of
energy term values, transition probabilities and
interaction potentials.
•
Spectra of rotational transitions and of ﬁne or
hyperﬁne splittings can be measured with micro-
wave spectroscopy.
•
Molecular vibrations are mainly detected using
infrared and Raman spectroscopy, where the
two methods supplement each other. Transitions
where the electric dipole moment changes are
infrared active, those where the polarizability
changes are Raman active.
•
The spectral resolution of classical spectroscopy
is generally limited by the resolving power
of spectrographs. In Fourier spectroscopy it is
limited by the maximum path difference bet-
ween the two interfering beams. Laser spec-
troscopic techniques allow the resolution of
the real line proﬁles of atomic or molecular
transitions.
•
Sub-Doppler spectroscopy is possible in collima-
ted molecular beams or by nonlinear techniques
that are based on the velocity selective saturation
of molecular transitions.
•
Magnetic and electric moments can be determined
with radio frequency spectroscopy in molecu-
lar beams in combination with the deﬂection
of molecules in inhomogeneous ﬁelds (Rabi
method)
•
Photoelectron spectroscopy measures energy and
angular distribution of photoelectrons produced
by photoionization of atoms or molecules. It gives
information on the energies and wave functions
of inner-shell electrons and their inﬂuence on
molecular structure and binding energies.
•
Elastic, inelastic and ionizing collisions of elec-
trons with atoms or molecules allow the determi-
nation of excitation and ionization cross sections
as a function of the electron energy and give in-
formation on correlation effects between bound
electrons in atoms and molecules.
•
Measurementsofelasticandinelasticcollisionbet-
ween atoms and molecules allow the determina-
tion of interaction potentials. The most detailed
information is obtained from differential cross sec-
tions, from which in some cases, one can also
determinepotentialswithnonsphericalsymmetric.
•
In the ideal scattering experiment, differential
cross sections are measured for selected inelas-
tic transitions where the initial and the ﬁnal state
of one collision partner is determined together
with the scattering angle. This opens the possibil-
ity of studying chemical reactions in detail on the
molecular level.
•
The investigation of collision processes by laser
spectroscopic techniques allows the determina-
tion of integral collision cross sections in cells
and of differential cross section in crossed molec-
ular beams. The preparation of selected states
before the collision and the analysis of states after
the collision yields cross sections for individual
collision-induced state-to-state transitions.
•
Time-resolved measurements can follow up dy-
namical processes in atoms and molecules, such
as radiative decay, collision-induced transitions or
isomerization and dissociation of molecules.
Experimental techniques for lifetime measure-
ments include excitation with intensity-modulated
light, single-photon counting with delayed coin-
cidence or fast pump-and-probe techniques. The
time resolution is currently a few femtoseconds
and reaches in special cases the sub femtosecond
regime.

12. Modern Developments in Atomic
and Molecular Physics
Over the last few years, several very interesting new
developments in atomic and molecular physics were
initiated that have considerably widened our under-
standing of the interaction of light with matter and
opened new possibilities for many applications. In this
chapter we will brieﬂy discuss some of the experiments
that have pushed forward these developments.
12.1 Optical Cooling
and Trapping of Atoms
For many investigations of atoms, their thermal veloci-
ty limits the spectral resolution. Although the Doppler-
free techniques presented in the previous chapter can
overcome the Doppler-limit, atoms with velocity v on-
ly spend a limited time Δt = d/v inside the interaction
region with a laser beam of diameter d and therefore
the “time-of-ﬂight” broadening Δν = 1/Δt of spectral
lines still presents a principal limit to the resolution.
In particular, for precision measurements it is desir-
able to keep atoms inside the observation region as long
as possible, free from interactions with other particles
or with the wall of the vacuum chamber. In order to
reach this goal, one has to reduce the atom velocity and
trap the atoms for a sufﬁciently long time in a small
and well-deﬁned volume away from any walls of the
vacuum vessel.
This has become possible by new techniques of op-
tical cooling and trapping, which allows one to reduce
the temperature of an atomic gas down to below 1 μ K,
without condensation taking place.
12.1.1 Photon Recoil
Assume an atom with mass m is moving with the ve-
locity v into the z direction. When a photon hν with
Fig. 12.1a–c. Momentum transfer by recoil effect by
(a) absorption of a photon, (b) emission of a photon, and (c)
total transfer for one absorption-emission cycle
momentum ¯hk traveling into the opposite −z direc-
tion is absorbed by the atom, the total momentum p =
mv + ¯hk must be conserved (Fig. 12.1). After photon
absorption, the atom has a lower velocity
v′ = v −¯hk/m .
The
velocity
change
|Δv| = |v′ −v| = |¯hk/m| =
hν/(mc) is, however, very small.
EXAMPLE
Sodium atoms with m = 23 AMU = 3.8 × 10−26 kg
absorb, on their resonance transition 3S →3P1/2, light
with wavelength λ = 589 nm. The photon energy is
hν = 2 eV ⇒Δv = hν/(mc) = 3 cm/s. If the initial
velocity is v = 600 m/s the deceleration down to v = 0
requires the absorption of 2 × 104 photons.
The excited atom emits a ﬂuorescence photon,
which also causes a recoil and therefore a transfer of

Fig. 12.2. For many absorption-emission cycles, the aver-
age recoil of the ﬂuorescence photons is zero and the net
momentum transfer for N absorbed photons is Δ p = N ¯hk
momentum to the atom. However, the direction of the
emitted ﬂuorescence photons is randomly distributed
over the whole solid angle. If the atom undergoes many
absorption-emission cycles during its interaction time
with a laser beam, the time average over the momentum
transfer by the emission becomes zero (Fig. 12.2).
How many absorption-emission cycles can be
realized?
If we choose a true two-level system, where the ab-
sorption takes place on the transition ⟨1| →⟨2| and the
ﬂuorescence from the excited level ⟨2| terminates only
on the initial level ⟨1| we have a closed system, where
the atom is never transferred to levels other than ⟨1|
or ⟨2|. After excitation of level ⟨2| with a mean life-
time τ2 by a laser photon at time t the ﬂuorescence
photon is emitted with an average delay time τ2. This
means that the initial level ⟨1| is only populated again
at the time t + τ2. The next laser photon can therefore
excite the same atom no earlier than at time t + τ2. The
ﬂuorescence rate is N2A2 = N2/τ2. Since the popula-
tion N2 cannot be larger than N1 (otherwise, stimulated
emission will bring the atoms back to level ⟨1|) the ab-
sorption rate cannot be larger than the ﬂuorescence rate
and the maximum rate of absorption emission cycles is
Ra = 1/(2τ2) [12.1].
EXAMPLES
a) For sodium atoms, the lifetime of the upper 32P1/2
level is τ2 = 16 ns. The maximum number of ab-
sorbed photons per second is then Nph = 6.3 ×
107 /s. With an initial velocity of v0 = 600 m/s it
takes 2 × 104 absorbed photons in order to bring the
atom to rest with v = 0. This takes only 3 × 10−4 s.
The deceleration a = −dv/dt = −2 × 106 m/s2 is
about 200,000 times larger than the earth’s acceler-
ation g = 9.8 m/s2!
b) For magnesium atoms, with m = 24 AMU, which
absorb on the resonance singlet transition at λ =
285.2 nm, the deceleration is even larger because
of the higher photon energy hν = 3.7 eV and the
shorter lifetime τ = 2 ns of the upper level. The
result is that Δv = −6 cm/s per absorbed photon
and the required number of absorbed photons to
completely stop the atoms is 1.3 × 104. This gives
a minimum stopping time of 3 × 10−5 s. During the
deceleration time, the atoms travel along a
path
length of about 1 cm,

if their velocity
was initially v0 = 600 m/s.
How can such a true two-level system be realized?

tion 3S1/2 →3P3/2 is shown with the hyperﬁne com-
ponents characterized by the quantum number F of

The experimental arrangement for decelerating
atoms in a collimated atomic beam is shown in
Fig. 12.4. The pump-laser beam is directed along the
molecular beam axis opposite to the velocity of the
atoms. The ﬁnal velocity of the atoms is monitored by
a weak probe laser crossing the molecular beam with
an angle α against the beam axis. The absorption of
the probe laser is Doppler-shifted against the resonance
frequency ω0 by the amount Δω = v · k = vk cos α ⇒
Δν = (v/λ) cos α.
During the deceleration process the following
problem arises. Because of the Doppler-shift the
frequency ω of the pump laser has to be tuned to ω =
ω0 −kv = ω0 −kvz, which changes in time while the

a ﬁxed laser frequency and Zeeman tuning of the atomic

velocity decreases. Two solutions have been found:
Either the laser frequency or the absorption frequen-
cy of the atoms must be tuned such that they are
synchronized with the changing Doppler-shift. When
using diode lasers, the laser frequency can be shift-
ed with the electric current through the diode. The
absorption frequency of the atoms can be shifted by
Zeeman tuning in a magnetic ﬁeld B(z), which decreas-
es with increasing z in such a way that the Zeeman
transition always stays in resonance with the ﬁxed laser
frequency (Fig. 12.5).
12.1.2 Optical Cooling of Atoms
In the previous section, “one-dimensional cooling” was
discussed, where only one velocity component of the
atoms was decelerated. The ﬁnal goal is the decel-
eration of all three velocity components resulting in
a real three-dimensional cooling and a corresponding
reduction of the gas temperature.
When atoms in a gas cell are irradiated from
six laser beams pointing into the ±x, ±y, ±z directions
(Fig. 12.6) the atoms suffer a recoil if they absorb pho-
tons from the six beams. The absorption probability
depends on the detuning from the resonance frequency
ω0. An atom with a velociy v can absorb laser photons

Fig. 12.8. Frictional force F(v) (solid curve) and absorption
coefﬁcient α(v) (dashed curve) in an optical molasses for
a red detuning δ = −γ . The dashed curve shows the absorp-
tion proﬁles by atoms moving with vx = ±γ/k for a single
laser beam propagating in the x direction
which is proportional to the atomic velocity. Its depen-
dence on the detuning δ is illustrated in Fig. 12.8.
When the laser frequency ωL is slightly smaller
than the resonance frequency ω0 (δ < 0) atoms
moving towards a laser beam have a larger prob-
ability to absorb a photon than those atoms that
move in the direction of the beam. Therefore
in this case the atoms are pushed towards the
overlap region of the six laser beams [12.2].
An atom with mass M, moving inside the overlap
region of the six laser beams experience a force with
the three components Fi(vi) = −avi (i = x, y, z), that
damps its velocity. From the relation
dv/dt = F/M ⇒dv/v = −a
M dt
we obtain the time-dependent velocity components
vi = vi0e−(a/M)t .
(12.5)
The velocity of an atom that experiences pho-
ton recoil in the overlap region of six laser
beams in ±x, ±y and ±z directions, decreases
exponentially with the damping time tD = M/a.
The ensemble of atoms under the inﬂuence of these
frictional forces is called optical molasses.

12.1. Optical Cooling and Trapping of Atoms
491
EXAMPLE
For Na atoms one obtains, for a detuning δ = 2γ and
with the data of the example in the previous section,
the constant a = 1 × 10−20 Ns/m and a damping time
tD = 2.3 μ s. The atoms move in this overlap region
like particles in a viscous molasses.
What are the lowest temperatures that can be
reached by optical cooling?
The smaller the velocity of the atoms become, the
smaller is their Doppler-shift and the closer the laser
frequency ωL must approach the center frequency ω0
of the atomic transition in order to stay in resonance. If
the velocity v of the atoms has decreased to v < γ/k,
the detuning δ = ωL −ω0 has to be smaller than the
homogeneous width γ of the atomic transition. The
cooling efﬁciency decreases with decreasing δ and for
ωL = ω0 the net cooling force becomes zero.
Because of the recoil effect during the absorption
or emission of photons each atom performs a ran-
dom motion comparable to the Brownian motion (see
Sect. 2.3.1). Although the time average ⟨v⟩of the
atomic velocities is zero, the mean square value

v2
increases by the random recoil forces, which means
that the temperature increases. This increase has to be
compensated by the cooling force which only acts for
δ < 0. The minimum temperature Tmin is reached when
even for δ < γ the energy ΔE < ¯hγ taken away from
the atom by optical cooling can just compensate for
the thermal energy kBT , added to the atom by the ran-
dom recoil momentum. This gives for the minimum
temperature the “Doppler limit”
Tmin = ¯hγ/kB .
(12.6)
EXAMPLE
For a natural linewidth γ = 10 MHz the minimum
temperature is Tmin = 72 μ K.
Experiments have shown, however, that even low-
er temperatures below 1 μ K can be reached. Therefore
another cooling effect has to be present, which is relat-
ed to the shift of atomic energy levels in the ﬁeld of the
standing laser waves. The optical transition probabili-
ty depends on the electric ﬁeld strength in the standing
laser wave and leads to the effect, that on the average
the absorbed photon has a smaller energy than the emit-
ted ﬂuorescence photon, thus taking away energy from
the atom (Sisyphus cooling) [12.3, 4].
This cooling technique results in a lower limit
for the attainable temperature of atoms with mass M,
which is called the recoil limit
Trecoil = h2/(2M · λ2 · kB).
EXAMPLE
For the Na-atom with M = 23AMU and λ = 590nm
one obtains
Trecoil = 1.2 · 10−6K = 1.2μ K
12.1.3 Optical Trapping of Atoms
Although optical cooling decreases the volume of an
atomic cloud in the velocity space, it does not con-
centrate them in real space. This can be achieved with
a device called a magneto-optical trap (MOT), illus-
trated in Fig. 12.9. The MOT consists of a pair of
anti-Helmholtz coils through which a current is sent in-
to opposite directions. With the z-axis as the symmetry
axis, the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the coils in the
vicinity of the trap center at z = 0 is
B(z) = bz .
(12.7)
The magnetic ﬁeld is zero at the center z = 0 and
increases linearly with increasing distance from the
center. The ﬁeld lines are indicated as blue curves in
Fig. 12.9a.
In the magnetic ﬁeld the atomic energy levels ex-
perience a splitting into Zeeman components with the
energies
Ei = −pm · B = gFμBmF|B| .
(12.8)
Where μB is the Bohr-magneton, F is the quantum
number of the total angular momentum (including nu-
clear spin) and mF the magnetic quantum number
−F ≤mF ≤F.
In Fig. 12.10b the z-dependence of the Zeeman
energy is plotted for the two levels with F = 0 and
F = 1.
The six laser beams passing through the MOT are
circularly polarized (Fig. 12.10a). They induce tran-
sitions with ΔmF = ±1. If the laser frequency ωL is

below the resonance frequency ω0, atoms in the region
z >0 absorb preferentially σ −-light inducing ΔmF =
−1 transitions, while for z < 0 mainly σ +-light is ab-
sorbed. For z = 0 the absorption rates for σ + and
for σ −light are equal. Since for ω < ω0 atoms mov-
ing towards the laser beam propagation suffer a larger
average recoil than those moving into the direction of
the beam propagation (see Sect. 12.1.2) this pushes
all atoms moving outwards back towards the center.
The gas of cold molecules is therefore compressed into
a dense cloud around the center of the MOT.
The z-dependent force acting on the atoms is (sim-
ilar to the discussion in the previous section)

(12.11)
This is a force that linearly increases with z. Because
Fz = −∂Epot/∂z we can attribute to the MOT a har-
monic potential
Epot(z) = 1
2 Dz2 ,
(12.12)
which stabilizes the atoms around z = 0.

12.1. Optical Cooling and Trapping of Atoms
493
Including the velocity-dependent force, discussed
in the previous section, the total force acting on the
atoms is
Fz = −Dz −avz
(12.13)
resulting in a damped oscillation of the atoms with
mass M around the trap center with a frequency
Ω =
$
D/M
(12.14)
and the damping constant
β = a/M .
(12.15)
EXAMPLES
For Rubidium atoms with M = 1.4 × 10−25 kg the
absorption
wavelength
is
λ = 785 nm ⇒k = 8 ×
106 m−1. With a laser detuning δ = γ and an absorp-
tion rate R0 = γ/2 one obtains a = 4 × 10−21 Ns/m.
With a magnetic ﬁeld gradient b = 0.1 T/m and the
magnetic moment pm ≈μB the constant D = 2.37 ×
10−18 can be calculated. This gives the oscillation fre-
quency ω = 4,100 s−1 and the damping constant β =
1.2 × 10−2. The atoms relax with a time constant of
12 ms after about 50 oscillation periods against the trap
center.
Up to now we have only regarded the movement of
the atoms in the z direction.
For the x and y directions, similar considerations
hold. The magnetic ﬁeld of the anti-Helmholtz coils is
a quadrupole ﬁeld. From Maxwell’s equation divB = 0
follow the relations
∂Bx
∂x = ∂By
∂y = −1
2
∂Bz
∂z .
(12.16)
The restoring forces in the x and y directions are
therefore one half of that in the z direction.
Note:
Besides these restoring forces due to the recoil by pho-
ton absorption, there is, of course, also the magnetic
force
Fm = −pm · grad B .
(12.17)
Inserting the relevant ﬁgures for the experimentally re-
alized ﬁeld gradients, it turns out that this force is much
smaller then the recoil force.
For more detailled information on magneto-optical
traps see [12.5, 6].

the different atoms can no longer be distinguished, be-
cause each atom can be only localized within its de

that above a critical density

(12.18b)
the properties of the gas drastically change. Since the
average kinetic energy is

we can express the de Broglie wavelength by
λDB =
h
√3mkBT
(12.19)
and obtain for the critical density the expression
nc = 13.57(mkBT )3/2/h3 ,
(12.20)
which depends on the temperature T of the atomic
gas. Below a critical temperature Tc a phase tran-
sition takes place for a gas of bosonic atoms from
a classical gas to a degenerate gas of indistinguishable
atoms. Bosonic atoms have an integer total spin quan-
tum number and each energy level can be occupied by
many atoms, different from Fermonic atoms with a spin
of 1/2, where each energy level can be occupied by at
most two particles. At a sufﬁciently low temperature,
all bosonic atoms occupy the lowest possible energy
state. Such an atomic ensemble represents a degener-
ate gas, which is called a Bose–Einstein condensate
(BEC) after the Indian mathematician Satyendra Nath
Bose, who in 1922 developed the concept of indistin-
guishable photons and gave a mathematical proof of
Planck’s radiation formula. He sent his ideas to Albert
Einstein who generalized Bose’s model to include not

494
12. Modern Developments in Atomic and Molecular Physics
only photons but all particles with integer spin quan-
tum numbers. They predicted the behavior of Bosons
for transitions from a classical to a degenerate gas. Both
authors published the results in 1924 [12.7].
EXAMPLE
The Na atom has an electron spin of 1/2 and a nu-
clear spin of 3/2. The total spin quantum number in
the 2S1/2 ground state is F = 1 or F = 2. The sodi-
um atom is therefore a bosonic atom. The Li atom has
the two isotopes 6Li and 7Li with nuclear spins I = 1
and I = 3/2. Together with the electron spin s = 1/2
the total spin quantum number for 6Li is odd (it is
a Fermion) and for 7Li it is even (it is a boson).
Inserting the relevant ﬁgures into equation (12.20),
it turns out that the temperature reached by optical
cooling is still not low enough to reach the critical
temperature for BEC. Therefore, additional cooling
techniques have to be applied. One of these methods
is based on evaporation cooling. It is in principle the
same technique one uses for cooling a hot cup of cof-
fee by blowing over the liquid surface. This removes
the fastest molecules in the vapor phase above the
surface and decreases the average kinetic energy, i.e.,
the temperature of the remaining molecules. The basic
principle applied to the molecules in the MOT is the
following [12.8].
At ﬁrst the cold atoms are transferred from a MOT
to a pure magnetic trap that has no cooling lasers, by
pushing them with a laser beam into the wanted direc-
tion. In this trap that is formed by an inhomogeneous
magnetic ﬁeld, they are kept not by the recoil forces
of lasers like in the MOT, but by the magnetic force
F = −pm grad B due to their magnetic moment pm,
(Fig. 12.11a,b). Although this force is much smaller
than the recoil force, the atoms, which are now already
very cold, can be trapped since their kinetic energy
is small. Here they have the potential energy Epot =
−pm · B. Due to the distribution of their thermal energy
they ﬁll the trap potential up to the energy Emax.
Now the trap is irradiated by a radio-frequency that
induces ﬂips of the electron spin s, when its frequen-
cy νrf = ΔE/h matches the energy difference ΔE =
E↑−E↓= gsμB · B = 2μBB (see Sect. 5.6).
The atoms that have suffered a spin ﬂip are auto-
matically pushed out of the trap because their potential

is now repulsive (Fig. 12.11b). Choosing the frequen-
cy in such a way that only the hottest atoms can make
a spin ﬂip, results in a decrease of the mean energy of
the trapped atoms. During the evaporation of atoms, the
temperature drops below the critical temperature. The
radial density proﬁle of the atoms becomes very narrow
because all atoms condense into the lowest potential
energy state of the magnetic trap increasing the atom
density at the center. This can be monitored by send-
ing a widened weak laser beam through the condensate,
which is partly absorbed (Fig. 12.12). With a CCD-
array, the transmitted intensity is detected, which is
a measure of the spatial dependence of the absorption
and thus of the density of atoms (Fig. 12.12a–d).

By this technique the ﬁrst experimental proof of
Bose–Einstein condensation was reported in 1996 by
E. Cornell and C. Wieman in Boulder, Colorado [12.8]
and independently by W. Ketterle and his group at MIT
in Boston [12.9, 10]. Both groups received the Nobel
Prize in Physics in 2001 for this pioneering work.
Meanwhile BEC of multi-component atoms have been
realized, where Fermions are cooled by collisions with
cold Bosons (sympathetic cooling) [12.11]. Recently,
even Bose–Einstein condensation for molecules has
been achieved [12.12].
The BEC behaves in many aspects like a supra-
liquid with zero viscosity. Spectroscopy of atoms in
a Bose–Einstein condensate gives a lot of information
on collective effects of many atoms, which are all in
the same state [12.13]. One of the fascinating effects
is the release of a coherent beam of atoms out of the
BEC. Such a coherent beam represents a large ﬂux of
atoms that all have nearly the same energy. Because of
its resemblance to a coherent beam of photons, which
is a laser beam, it is called an atom laser. Two beams
from the same BEC can interfere with each other if they
are spatially overlapping [12.14].
These atom lasers can ﬁnd applications in atom in-
terferometry [12.15] and in surface science for inspect-
ing surfaces with a spatial resolution in the subnanome-
ter range. Recent investigations of the characteristics
of such condensates for different atoms concentrate on
the dynamics in the BEC, such as collision process-
es, formation of molecules, generation of turbulences
such as vortices with quantized angular momenta, fric-
tional effects and factors inﬂuencing the lifetime of a
BEC. Of interest are the differences and similarities be-
tween BEC and superﬂuid liquids and electromagnetic
induced optical transparency.
12.1.5 Molecular Spectroscopy in a MOT
Since the relative velocity of cold atoms in a MOT
is very small, they stay for a longer time togeth-
er when they approach each other. During this time
the atom pair can be excited by a laser into a stable
molecular state (Fig. 12.13). By a second laser stim-
ulated emission can be induced terminating on levels
of the electronic ground state below the dissociation
threshold. In this way molecules can be formed by
photo-association. If both lasers are narrow band sin-
gle mode lasers spectroscopy of levels close to the
dissociation energy of the diatomic molecule can be
performed with ultrahigh resolution.
For these high-lying levels, the mean distance be-
tween the two atoms can become very large and sev-
eral small effects are signiﬁcant for the small binding
energy, such as magnetic interactions between elec-
tron and nuclear spins, or retardation effects due to
the ﬁnite time delay at which a change of the elec-
tron position at one atom inﬂuences the second atom.
Such effects can even cause a second shallow mini-
mum in the potential curve of the diatomic molecule
at internuclear distances of about 10–30 nm besides
the deep minimum at the equilibrium distance Re ≈

0.2–0.3 nm [12.16]. A very ingenious method to pro-
duce Bose-Einstein condensation of molecules from
atoms in a BEC is based on the energy difference
of atoms with electron spin and of molecules in a
magnetic ﬁeld [12.18].
In Fig. 12.14 the potential energy of an atomic col-
lision pair Cs + Cs and that of the molecule Cs2 is
plotted as a function of the magnetic ﬁled strength B.
The ﬁeld dependence Epot(B) is stronger for the col-
lision pair with each atom in the hyperﬁne level with
the quantum numbers F = 3, MF = 3. L = 0 and the
magnetic moment μ = 1.5μB than for the molecule in
the 4g hyperﬁne level with F = 4 and μ = 0.93μB.
At a critical ﬁeld strength Bc the lines cross each oth-
er. This implies that at this magnetic ﬁeld strength the
energy of the atom pair is the same as that of the
molecule in the speciﬁc level (see insert in Fig. 12.14)
This resonant condition is called Feshbach resonance
[12.17]. At magnetic ﬁelds B < Bc the molecule has a
lower energy than the atom pair and is therefore sta-
ble. When the magnetic ﬁeld is slowly (adiabatically)
scanned from higher ﬁelds over the Feshbach reso-
nance to lower ﬁelds, stable molecule can be formed.
This can be monitored by the corresponding decrease
of the atomic density in the BEC. When the ﬁeld B
is again increased beyond Bc the molecules become
unstable and the atomic density increases again.
Since the dimer Cs2 has an integer total spin (S
= 0 and I = 3) it is a Boson and can form a Bose-
Einstein condensate [12.18]. These dimers represent
huge molecules with internuclear separation of about
100nm! Their spectroscopy gives information about
interatomic forces at large distances and allows deter-
mining the very last vibration level directly below the
dissociation energy.
The study of molecule formation at these extreme-
ly low temperatures gives information on the velocity
dependence of reactive collisions and on the depen-
dence of collision cross sections on the relative spin
orientation.

12.2 Time-resolved Spectroscopy
in the Femtosecond Range
With the development of femtosecond lasers, a whole
new area of research has begun. Now molecular vibra-
tions or the formation and dissociation of molecules
can be observed in real-time. The old dream of pho-
tochemists to be able to control chemical reactions by
light has, at least for some favorable examples, become
true.
In this section we will discuss some exciting exam-
ples regarding these new developments in the applica-
tion of femtosecond lasers.
12.2.1 Time-resolved Molecular Vibrations
Stationary spectroscopy measures time averages of
molecular states. For example, the average internuclear
distance of diatomic molecules in the vibrational lev-
el ⟨v| obtained from measurements of the rotational
constant Bv, is the time average over many vibrational
periods (see Sect. 9.5).
With femtosecond optical pulses the motion of the
vibrating nuclei can be made “visible” in a similar way
as fast periodic macroscopic motions can be visualized
by a stroboscopic technique where the body is made
visible by pulsed illumination with a repetition fre-
quency that is adapted to that of the motion. We will
illustrate the technique using the Na2 molecule as an
example (Fig. 12.15).
A femtosecond laser pulse (pump-pulse) with time
duration Δt excites the molecules from their ground
state into a superposition of vibrational levels v′ within
the energy interval ΔE = h/Δt in an electronically ex-
cited state. The different vibrational levels are excited
coherently and form a wave packet |ψ(R, t)|2, which
moves in the (R, t) diagram of Fig. 12.16 periodical-
ly between the minimum value Rmin and the maximum
value Rmax in the potential of the upper state (which is,
for our example, the D1&u state of Na2). If the excit-
ed molecule is now further excited by a second laser
pulse it can be ionized. The ionization depends on the
internuclear distance R at which the second pulse ﬁnds
the molecule. For R = Rmax the probe laser pulse can
reach the ionization limit for the dissociation

is measured as a
function of the delay time between the pump- and
probe-pulse, the oscillatory curve of Fig. 12.17 is ob-
tained, from which the vibrational period in the inter-
mediate level of the 1&u state can be inferred.
12.2.2 Femtosecond Transition State Dynamics
With femtosecond laser pulses, short-lived transient
states of molecular systems can be studied “in real-
time”. One example is the photo-dissociation of a di-
atomic molecule, which has a bound ground state |0⟩,
but a repulsive potential in the excited state |k⟩
(Fig. 12.18). If the pump laser pulse reaches the ex-
cited state potential at an internuclear distance R1 the
fragments of the dissociated molecule have a kinet-
ic energy Ekin(R) = Epot(R1) −Epot(R = ∞). Which
depends on the slope of the potential Epot(R) in the
upper state as a function of R. If the probe pulse has
a delay Δt, it excites the molecule further into the
state |i⟩at a separation R = R1 + ΔR with ΔR =
' Δt
0
vdt. The excitation into the state |i⟩can be detect-
ed by the ﬂuorescence emitted from |i⟩. The maximum
ﬂuorescence is reached when the separation R corre-
sponding to the time delay Δt has a value for which
ΔE(R) = Ei(R) −Ek(R) = hν2.
Varying the time delay Δt one can map out the
difference ΔE(R) of the two potential curves.

ciation on a femtosecond scale
EXAMPLE
The iodine atoms in the dissociating I2 molecule have
with Ekin = 15 meV a velocity v = 100 m/s. After
a time delay of Δt = 10 ps their separation R has in-
creased by 1 nm. In order to map out the potential curve
with a resolution of 0.1 nm, a time resolution of 1 ps is
demanded.
A second example is the photodissociation of the
NaI molecule, which shows at the internuclear distance
Rc an avoided crossing of the ground state potential,
dissociating into Na+ + I−and the excited state poten-
tial, which converges towards the lower energy of the
neutral products Na + I (Fig. 12.19a). If the molecule
is excited at the distance R1 into the repulsive part
of the excited state potential, the wave packet moves
“downhill” towards larger separations R. At the avoid-
ed crossing of the two potential curves part of the wave
packet is transmitted and forms neutral Na and I atoms.
The other part is reﬂected back towards small R values,
until it is again reﬂected at the inner part of the repul-
sive potential. It reaches the crossing point again where
it is partly transmitted and partly reﬂected, etc.

time Δt between pump and probe pulses with λ2 tuned to

When the wavelength λ2 of the probe laser is tuned
to the atomic Na transition, the laser-induced atomic
resonance ﬂuorescence is a measure for the number of
Na atoms formed by the molecular excitation (curve (a)
in Fig. 12.19b). If the wavelength λ2 is tuned to the
energy difference ΔE(R < Rc) the probe laser maps
the oscillatory movement of the reﬂected part of the
wave packet (curve (b)).
12.2.3 Coherent Control
If a polyatomic molecule is excited into a dissoci-
ating state, the dissociation products depend on the
preparation of the excited state by the excitation pulse
(Fig. 12.20). For example, when a molecule ABC is
excited, there are three different decay channels.
ABC + hν →(ABC)∗
AB + C
↗
→ABC + hν
↘A + BC
(12.21)
Which of the three channels is actually realized, de-
pends on the spatial distribution and on the phase of
the wave function ψ(r, t) in the excited state of ABC,
which in turn can be inﬂuenced by the wavelengths, the

The coherent control technique tries to optimize

This is performed by a learning algorithm and works as
follows [12.22].
The pump pulse is sent onto an optical grat-
ing, that diffracts the different wavelengths of the
pulse components into different directions (Fig. 12.21).

other due to the dispersion by the grating. The parallel
beam passes through a liquid crystal array consisting
of many pixels. When an electric voltage U is applied
to these pixels the molecules in the liquid crystal be-
tween the electrodes are partly oriented and the index
of refraction n changes, where Δn ∝U. This caus-
es a phase shift of the transmitted optical wave. Since
the voltage for each pixel can be chosen separately the
phase of each wavelength-component passing through
one of the pixels can be controlled separately.
A second lens focuses the parallel beam onto a sec-
ond grating, where the different wavelengths are again
superimposed and leave the system as a parallel out-
put beam. Because of the different phase shifts for the
different wavelengths the intensity distribution I(t) has
changed. The time proﬁle of the output pulse and the
intensity distribution I(λ) of the different wavelength
components can be varied within certain ranges by
changing the voltages across the different pixels of the
liquid crystal.
In order to optimize a speciﬁc reaction the out-
put pulse is sent into the reaction chamber and the
wanted products are measured. The signal is fed into
a computer that controls the different voltages of the
pixels. These voltages are now changed and the com-
puter checks whether the wanted signal has increased
or decreased. With a special learning algorithm (e.g.,
survival of the ﬁttest) the output laser pulse is opti-
mized in such a way, that it produces the maximum
wanted signal of the investigated reaction (Fig. 12.22).
For favorable cases the selectivity of the reaction could
be enhanced by one order of magnitude through this
optimized coherent control system.
For more details see [12.23, 24, 25, 26].
12.3 Optical Metrology
with New Techniques
For many scientiﬁc and technical applications, accurate
measurements of wavelengths, frequencies and time
are essential. One example is the precise determina-
tion of fundamental physical constants, such as the ﬁne
structure constant, the Rydberg-constant, the gravita-
tional constant and their possible changes with time.
Such changes must be very small, since they could not
be detected up to now. On the other hand they would
severely inﬂuence cosmological models and might lead
to a revision of fundamental physical principles.
A second example is the synchronization of the
detection systems in radio telescopes at different lo-
cations on earth, which demands very accurate and
stable frequencies in order to perform radio interferom-
etry with high angular resolution of radio signals from
distant galaxies.
On the technical side, the accuracy of the global
positioning system (GPS) is limited by the frequen-
cy stability of the signals superimposed from different
satellites.
It is therefore worthwhile to look for the optimum
method for generating ultrastable frequencies.
12.3.1 Frequency Comb
The frequency spectrum of a cw mode-locked laser,
emitting a regular train of short pulses, consists of
a comb of equally spaced frequency components that
represent the fundamental modes of the laser resonator
(see Sect. 8.5.2). The total spectral range Δν = 1/Δt
of the frequency comb depends on the width Δt of the
pulses. With femtosecond pulses (Δt = 50 fs) the spec-
tral range extends over Δν = 2 × 1013 s−1 = 20 THz.
This spectral range can be greatly increased by fo-
cusing the laser beam into a special optical ﬁber, where
the spectrum is considerably broadened by self-phase
modulation. The index of refraction depends on the in-
tensity of the laser pulses and a temporal phase change
causes a frequency shift, since δν = (1/2π) · dϕ/dt
(see Sect. 8.5.3). With sufﬁciently intense laser pulses,
a total spectral width of the frequency comb over more
than one decade (e.g., from λ = 1064 nm to 500 nm)
has been achieved, which corresponds to a frequency
interval of 320 THz.
EXAMPLE
With a resonator length d = 50 cm the spacing be-
tween the modes is Δνm = 300 MHz. With a total
spectral width of 320 THz the frequency comb includes
1.07 × 106 modes.
Measurements have proved that the spectral com-
ponents of the comb are precisely equidistant, even in
the far wings of the comb. This opens the possibility to
compare different frequency standards with very high

laser at λ = 3.39 μm with the optical frequency comb [12.27]
precision and to measure absolute optical frequencies.
The methods works as follows.
Presently, the cesium clock (Fig. 11.90) still repre-
sents the international frequency standard. The mode
spacing Δνm of the frequncy comb is locked to the
frequency νCs in such a way that νCs = mΔνm with
m ≈30. This locking can be realized by tuning the
length d of the laser resonator (Δνm = c/2d), until
the repetition rate of the mode-locked pulses equals
a subharmonic of the cesium frequency.
The frequency difference NΔνm between the n-th
and the (n + N)-th mode of the comb is now precisely
known.
In order to measure the absolute frequency of a sta-
bilized laser, the 4th harmonic of a He-Ne laser at
λ = 3.39 μm is compared with the frequency f1 of
the closest mode in the frequency comb (Fig. 12.23).
For a mode separation of 300 MHz the beat fre-
quency fc1 = 4νHe-Ne −f1 is smaller than 150 MHz
and can be therefore counted with a fast electronic
counter.
Now the frequency νHe-Ne is mixed in a non-
linear optical crystal with the doubled frequency 2 ·
4νHe-Ne and the difference frequency Δν = 8νHe-Ne −
1νHe-Ne = 7νHe-Ne is compared with the doubled
frequency 2νD of a tunable diode laser stabilized on

a mode f2 of the frequency comb, which is 584498
modes away from the mode f1 onto which 4νHe-Ne −
fc1 is stabilized. The difference frequency 7νHe-Ne −
2νD = fc2 is counted.
We have now the equations:
f1 −f2 = 584498 Δνm + fc1
4 fHe-Ne = f1 −fc1
7 fHe-Ne = 2 f2 −fc2
⇒fHe-Ne = 8 fHe-Ne −7He-Ne
= 2 × 584, 498 Δνm + fc2
which relates the cesium frequency νCs to the frequen-
cy νHe-Ne of the He-Ne laser since the matching fre-
quency fc1 is counted and known within 1 Hz [12.27].
In a similar way, the absolute frequency of the 1S →
2S transition in the hydrogen atom can be determined
with the help of the frequency comb (Fig. 12.24). In
order to realize this, the frequency-doubled output of
a dye-laser with λ = 486 nm is stabilized onto the
two-photon transition 1S–2S of atomic hydrogen at
λ = 121.5 nm, which has a natural line width of only
1.3 Hz (!), because the lifetime of the metastable 2S
level is about 0.13 s. Therefore the frequency of the
laser can be stabilized onto this narrow transition with
a stability of a few Hertz. The direct comparison of this
optical frequency with the microwave frequency of the
cesium standard can be performed with an accuracy of
Δν/ν ≤5 × 10−16 [12.28, 29].
12.3.2 Atomic Clocks with Trapped Ions
Very accurate and stable frequencies can be generat-
ed if the laser frequency is stabilized onto a narrow
transition of cold ions that are kept for a long time in an
ion trap [12.30]. This ion trap can be either a Penning
trap (Fig. 12.8) or an rf quadrupole trap (Fig. 12.25),
called a Paul trap after its inventor Wolfgang Paul
(Nobelprize 1989).
Here, a single ion can be trapped and optical-
ly cooled in the trap. After it has reached its lowest
temperature, it oscillates with very small amplitudes
around the trap center. The ion is excited from its
ground state by two different lasers into two upper
states. This is illustrated in Fig. 12.25 for the mercury
ion Hg+ with the ground state 5d106s(2S1/2), which
can be excited by the pump laser with λ = 194 nm in-
to the short-lived upper level 5d106p(2P1/2) with τ =
2.3 ns.
The ﬂuorescence, emitted from this level, serves as
a monitor for the excitation. With cw excitation the
ﬂuorescence photon rate is about 2.2 × 108 /s.
A second laser, called the clock laser, is tuned to
the dipole forbidden, but quadrupole-allowed transition
from the 2S1/2 ground state to the 2D5/2 level with
a lifetime of τ = 100 ms. This transition is very nar-
row (Δν = 1.5 Hz!). If the clock laser can be stabilized
onto the center of this narrow transition, a very high
frequency stability (ν/Δν ≥1016) can be achieved.
Since the cold ion is kept within a small volume

Fig. 12.26. Experimental demonstration of quantum jumps of
a single ion [12.31]
around the center of the trap, where the electric ﬁeld
is nearly zero, possible Stark-shifts are very small and
do not limit the absolute precision of the frequency
measurement.
With this system it is possible to observe single
quantum jumps. If only a single ion is present in the
trap, the ground state is empty for about 100 ms when
a clock transition has taken place before it is reﬁlled by
the ﬂuorescence photon from the 2D5/2 level. During
this time, the pump laser cannot excite the UV ﬂuo-
rescence and the signal is interrupted (Fig. 12.26). The
rate of these dark periods is a measure for the frequen-
cy of the clock transition. The longer the dark periods,
the closer is the clock laser frequency to the center of
the clock-transition [12.31].
When more than one ion is present in the trap, the
Coulomb repulsion between the ions pushes the ions
Fig. 12.27. Photograph of a Wigner crystal of seven trapped
ions, taken with a microscope and an image intensiﬁer. The
distance between the ions is about 20 μm [12.32]
away from the center and their positions in the trap are
determined by the minimum total potential energy of
the trap potential plus the Coulomb repulsion. Below
a critical temperature Tc, the ions arrange themselves
in a geometrical structure like in a solid crystal, how-
ever with distances between the ions, that are several
orders of magnitude larger than in the solid. Such an
arrangement is called a Wigner crystal (Fig. 12.27).
Such crystals, where the forces are well known, are
good candidates to study properties of solid crystals,
where the superposition of several effects often masks
the pure interaction between close neighboring atoms
[12.32, 33].
12.4 Squeezing
The electric ﬁeld of a monochromatic light wave can
be represented by
E(t) = E0(t)[cos(ωt + k · r + ϕ(t))]
(12.22a)
or by
E(t) = E1(t) cos(ωt + k · r) + E2(t) sin(ωt + k · r)
(12.22b)
with tan ϕ = −E2/E1. The electric ﬁeld amplitudes E1
and E2 are called the quadrature amplitudes.
Even when all technical noise has been eliminat-
ed there are still small ﬂuctuations of the amplitude
and the phase of the wave, because the wave consists
of N photons per second that are emitted in a ran-
dom way. Therefore the photon number N ﬂuctuates
within the range N ±
√
N and also the time sequence
of the photons (which corresponds to the phase of
the wave) shows similar ﬂuctuations. These ﬂuctua-
tions are caused by the quantum structure of light and
they represent principle limits, set by the uncertainty
relation, which generally cannot be overcome.
EXAMPLE
Assume an optical detector with the quantum efﬁciency
η < 1 is illuminated by N photons per sec. This leads
to a minimum relative ﬂuctuation ΔS/S of the signal S,
which for a bandwidth Δf is given by

For a radiation power of 1 mW at λ = 600 nm →N =

constant of 10 ms) and a quantum efﬁciency of 20%
we obtain a minimum ﬂuctuation ΔS/S = 4 × 10−7.
If the output signal is a voltage of 1 V it ﬂuctuates with
ΔU = 0.4 μ V.
In Fig. 12.28 the ﬂuctuations are illustrated in two
different ways. In the E(t) diagram the ﬂuctuation
ranges of amplitude and phase are indicated by the dot-
ted curves. In the E1-E2 diagram the uncertainty range,
due to the ﬂuctuations δE1 and δE2, are marked by the
area of the blue circle. It can be also characterized in
a polar vector diagram by the ﬂuctuations δϕ of the
direction of the vector E0 and δE0 of its length.
Assume, the ﬁeld amplitude in (12.22) represents
the electric ﬁeld of a single mode laser. If it is normal-
ized in such a way, that

where V is the volume of the mode, ε0 the dielectric

written as [12.30]
ΔE1ΔE2 ≥1 .
(12.25)
A coherent state of the single mode laser (also called
a Glauber state), can be written as a linear superpo-
sition of states with photon occupation numbers Nk.
This describes a Poisson distribution for the probability
of ﬁnding Nk photons, with the maximum at the mean
value < N >. For such a coherent state the uncertainties
have minimum values and are symmetric, i.e.,
ΔE1 = ΔE2 = 1 .
(12.26)
Such a state has the minimum possible uncertainty.

Fig. 12.28a,b. Amplitude and phase uncertainties of a laser
wave shown in an amplitude–time diagram (a) and in a polar
phase diagram (b)
The question is now whether it is possible to re-
duce the amplitude noise below this limit. Since the
uncertainty relation cannot be violated, the phase ﬂuc-
tuations then have to become larger. For certain experi-
ments this would still increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
For other experiments it might be desirable to reduce
the phase ﬂuctuations at the cost of higher amplitude
ﬂuctuations.
In the diagram of Fig. 12.28b this decrease of the
ﬂuctuations of one component at the cost of the oth-
er means a squeezing of the uncertainty circle into an
ellipse. The techniques used to change the relations
between amplitude-and phase-ﬂuctuations in favor of
the desired experimental results are therefore called
squeezing [12.34].
Coherent light shows phase-independent noise.
This can be experimentally demonstrated by the
two-beam Mach–Zehnder interferometer shown in
Fig. 12.29.
The monochromatic laser beam is split by the beam
splitter BS1 into two partial beams with amplitudes E1
and E2, which are superimposed again by BS2. One of
the beams passes through an optical wedge, where the
optical path-length can be continuously varied, which
causes a variable phase shift Δϕ between the two par-
tial waves. The two detectors PD1 and PD2 monitor the
mean intensities

averaged over many cycles of the optical ﬁeld with fre-

intensities are

⇒⟨I1⟩+ ⟨I2⟩= ⟨I0⟩.
(12.28)
The two detectors in Fig. 12.29 measure the projec-
tion of E in Fig. 12.28b onto the axes E1 and E2,
respectively. A variation of the phase ϕ in one arm of
the interferometer corresponds to a rotation of the vec-
tor E0. In Fig. 12.29b the intensity ⟨I(Δϕ)⟩is plotted
as a function of the phase-difference Δϕ between the
two beams. By a proper choice of Δϕ for the arrange-
ment in Fig. 12.29, one can measure the ﬂuctuations
⟨δE1⟩and ⟨δE2⟩separately. If the frequency spectra of
the intensities I1( f ) and I2( f ) are measured by a spec-
trum analyzer, it turns out that at higher frequencies,

(b) Detected mean intensity ⟨I⟩measured at f = 0, and
phase-independent photon noise power density, measured at

where the technical noise is negligible, the noise pow-
er spectral density ρn( f ) becomes independent of the
frequency f . The noise power densitiy ρn measured at
a frequency f = 10 MHz is independent of Δϕ. This
can be understood as follows.
The intensity ﬂuctuations are due to the random
emission of photons, which are uncorrelated in the two
interfering beams. Although the mean intensities ⟨I1⟩
and ⟨I2⟩depend on Δϕ, the ﬂuctuations do not! The
detected noise power density ρn ∼
√
N ∼√I0 shows
the same noise level for the minimum of I(Δϕ) as for
the maximum.
If the incident laser beam in Fig. 12.29a is blocked,
the noise level does not go to zero, but has a lower lim-
it ρ0 that is attributed to the zero-point ﬂuctuations of
the vacuum ﬁeld, which is also present in a darkroom.
This noise adds to the detector noise. The interferom-
eter has two inputs: the coherent light ﬁeld and the
vacuum ﬁeld, which is also present without the light

The preparation of squeezed states tries to mini-
mize the uncertainty of one of the two quantities δE
or δϕ at the expense of the increased uncertainty of
the other. The uncertainty area is then squeezed into
an ellipse. Although the area of this ellipse is slightly
larger than the circular area of the unsqueezed state,
one may still gain in the signal-to-noise ratio, if the
minimized quantity determines the noise level of the
detected signal.
This can be achieved by starting with a normal
coherent state of the incoming wave and introducing

12.4. Squeezing

a correlation between the ﬂuctuations of E1 and those
of E2, which means between amplitude and phase
ﬂuctuations. How can this be achieved?
The experimental realization of squeezing is based
on the nonlinear interaction of an optical wave in a non-
linear medium. One example is illustrated in Fig. 12.31,
which shows a Mach–Zehnder interferometer similar
to that in Fig. 12.29. However, one of the light beams
with amplitude E1(t) passes through a medium with
a nonlinear index of refraction
n(E) = n0 + n2E2
(12.30)
that depends on the intensity of the light wave. Assume
that the incident wave with amplitude
Ein(t) = Ein1 + δaE(t) + δphE(t)
(12.31)
has amplitude ﬂuctuations described by δaE(t) and
phase ﬂuctuations represented by δphE(t). If the medi-
um has negligible absorption the amplitude of the
outgoing wave is the same as that of the incident wave.
The phase of the wave, however, is affected by the
index of refraction. We obtain, after a pathlength L
through the medium,
ϕout = ϕin + 2πnL/λ
= ϕin + 2π L

Inserting this into (12.22a) we obtain

and
δEout

(12.33)
which means that the amplitude and its ﬂuctuation have
not changed for E1. For the phase ﬂuctuations the
situation is different. With δEph = E1δϕ one obtains

total noise has increased because the nonlinear medi-
um adds ﬂuctuations to the phase. In the quadrature
diagram, based on (12.22b), each point in the up-
per part of Fig. 12.32 represents certain instantaneous
ﬂuctuations δEa, δEph. If we look at the distribution
of the ﬂuctuations we obtain the upper diagrams in
Fig. 12.32, where each dot represents the instantaneous
value δEin

ph(t) on the left side and δEout

δEout
ph (t) on the right side. The lower graphs show the
corresponding histograms of the density of points. One
can see that the distribution of the amplitude ﬂuctu-
ations are narrower for the outgoing wave than for
the incident wave, while for the phase distribution, the
opposite is true.
This shows, that the arrangement of Fig. 12.31
reduces the amplitude ﬂuctuations at the expense
of increasing phase ﬂuctuations.
Squeezing can be detected by the interferometer
setup shown in Fig. 12.31, where the nonlinear medi-
um is placed in one arm of the interferometer. The
system acts as heterodyne detector where the local os-
cillator is the strong partial wave in the lower arm of the
interferometer, which interferes with the much weak-
er squeezed light in the upper arm. The two detectors
measure the two output signals Eout

signals is fed into a spectrum analyzer, which is set to
a ﬁxed frequency f . This gives a signal that represents
the ﬂuctuations of the output signals at the frequency f ,
that is proportional to the noise power density ρn( f ).
Now the phase of the local oscillator is continuously
changed by the optical wedge and the signal ΔS(Δϕ) is
measured as a function of the phase difference between
the two waves. The result is illustrated in Fig. 12.31b
and shows that for certain phase differences the ﬂuctu-
ations decrease below the noise level of two beams with
uncorrelated ﬂuctuations, which would be independent
of Δϕ.
Note the difference from Fig. 12.29, where the
output intensity ⟨I(ϕ)⟩is plotted, while here the ﬂuc-
tuations δI ∼ρn(Δϕ) are shown.
An interesting possible application of squeezing
might be the detection of gravitational waves by op-
tical interferometry [12.35]. Such waves travel with the
velocity of light through space and cause a contrac-
tion or expansion of space, depending on the amplitude
and phase of the wave. As predicted by Einstein, grav-
itational waves should be emitted from sources where
large masses are accelerated. Examples are supernovae
explosions of stars or close binary stars, which are two
stars bound by mutual gravitation that move around
their common center of mass. If the two components
have a small distance and therefore experience a large
acceleration, they can emit sufﬁciently intense grav-
itational waves that might be strong enough to be
detected on earth. The amplitude of the gravitational
wave depends on its frequency. In Fig. 12.33, cal-
culated amplitudes are shown for some astronomical
sources. Estimations show that a supernova explosion
in the Virgo cluster would generate gravitational waves
that cause a relative space contraction on earth as small
as 10−21! This means that a length of 1 m is changed by
10−21 m, which is 1011 times smaller than the diameter
of the hydrogen atom.
Up to now the sensitivity of gravitational wave de-
tectors has not been high enough to detect such small
effects, but new, large optical interferometers are under
construction that might reach the necessary sensitivi-
ty for detecting gravitational waves from supernovae
explosions in nearby galaxies [12.36].
The basic arrangement of these optical gravita-
tional wave antennas shown in Fig. 12.34 consists of
a Michelson-type interferometer with two long arms
that are orthogonal to each other. The side lengths of

depends on the reﬂectivity R of the beam splitter and
on the phase difference Δϕ between the two interfering
waves. The two polarizers P1 and P2 take care that the
two interfering waves are strictly linearly polarized and
the splitting ratio of the beam splitter, which depends
on the polarization state of the waves, remains constant.
If a gravitational wave arrives at the detector, the
arms of the interferometer are differently contracted
or expanded depending on the direction and on the
phase of the gravitational wave. Assume the gravita-
tional wave causes a change ΔL of one of the two long
arms resulting in a phase change Δϕg. Then the detec-
tor D1 with quantum efﬁciency η delivers for R = 0.5,

where Δϕ0 is the phase difference without gravitation-
al wave and δϕn is the phase ﬂuctuation due to noise.
The photon noise of the two interfering beams with
N/2 photons each is proportional to √N/2. The de-
tectors D2 and D3 measure the light powers and the
noise of the partial waves in the two arms before they
interfere. Part of the noise is due to random ﬂuctu-
ations of the photon number N. All three detectors
measure these ﬂuctuations. However, the difference
signal ΔS = S1 −(S2 −S3) does not depend on tech-
nical ﬂuctuations of the incident light power but is
sensitive to phase ﬂuctuations [12.36].
It turns out that the highest sensitivity can be
achieved if the power at the exit of the interferometer is
minimum, i.e., the phase difference should be Δϕ0 =π.
Then the average difference signal ΔS becomes for

It would be zero without a gravitational wave. The

The minimum detectable length change h = ΔL/L, in-

the length L of the interferometer arms, the maximum
available photon ﬂux N and the phase ﬂuctuations δϕn.
Recent improvements have allowed a sensitivity of h =
2 × 10−22/

Hz for the GEO 600 interferometer.
If a beam of squeezed light is coupled into the sec-
ond input port of the interferometer the phase noise
δϕn can be decreased (see above), which decreases the
noise level and increases the sensitivity.
There are deﬁnite plans to launch a huge interfer-
ometer, called LISA (large interferometer space an-
tenna) into space. It will consist of three satellites at
the corner of an equilateral triangle with distances of
5 × 106 km between the satellites (Fig. 12.35). The

center of the triangle moves 20◦behind the earth on
the earth’s orbit around the sun. The plane of the trian-
gle is inclined by 60◦against the ecliptic plane of the
earth’s path. It can be shown that for this conﬁguration
the three satellites sit in stable local potential minima
(Lagrange points), caused by the superposition of the
gravitational forces from sun and earth [12.37].
The side arms of this huge interferometer have to
be stabilized within a micron, which is certainly a chal-
lenge for the mechanical stability and the electronic
stabilization system [12.38].
12.5 New Trends in Quantum Optics
The experimental progress achieved in the develop-
ment of lasers with better frequency stability and of
high sensitivity detection techniques has allowed the
experimental realization of ideas that could only be
illustrated in former times with “Gedanken experi-
ments” and are related to fundamental principles of
quantum mechanics. Examples are the “which way”
experiments, the “quantum non-demolishing” experi-
ments, and “Schrödinger’s cat”, which we will brieﬂy
discuss in this section.
12.5.1 Which Way Experiments
Assume a light beam hits a 50% beam splitter
(Fig. 12.36a). The two detectors A and B then both
detect 50% of the incident intensity. If the intensity is
dropped to such a low value that only one photon is
ever on the way from the source to the detectors, then
either A or B is hit by the photon, because the photon
cannot split. Averaged over many measuring results the
number of counts will be, however, equal for A and B,
thus reproducing the classical result.

Now we supplement our device to the Mach–
Zehnder interferometer in Fig. 12.36b. The photon can
either travel along path 1 or path 2. One would again
expect that each of the two detectors A and B is hit
on the average by 50% of all incident photons. But
the experiment tells us that for a proper adjustment of
the two path lengths 1 and 2, only detector A receives
photons but not B. For another adjustment the oppo-
site is true. If we, however, block one of the paths 1
or 2, both detectors again receive 50% of all incident
photons.
The photon apparently has information about both
paths 1 and 2.
In Sect. 3.5 we discussed Young’s double-slit ex-
periment with electrons and photons. The astonishing
result was that interference structures could be ob-
served even if only one photon or one electron at a time
was passing through one of the slits. The essential
point was that we did not know through which of the
two slits the photon or electron had passed. When, in
a Gedanken experiment, the electron was illuminated
behind the slits by a photon, it could be decided through
which of the two slits the electron had passed. This
knowledge about “which way” the particle has taken
destroyed the interference pattern. Although the argu-
ment that the momentum, transferred to the electron by
absorption of the photon, would smear out the interfer-
ence structure, is convincing, this is not the real reason
for the disappearance of the interference.
This was experimentally conﬁrmed by Rempe and
his group [12.39] in a “which way experiment” based
on an atom interferometer, which is explained in
Fig. 12.37. An incoming collimated beam A of cold
rubidium atoms from a MOT (see Sect. 12.1) pass-
es through two separated standing light waves. The
detuning Δω = ωL −ω0 of the light frequency from
the atomic resonance ω0 is so large that spontaneous
emission is negligible. When entering the standing
light ﬁeld with intensity I = I0 cos2(kLz), the atoms
experience a periodic potential U(z) = U0 cos2(kLz)
with U0 ∼I0/Δω and some of the atoms are Bragg
reﬂected. This splits the incoming atomic beam into
two beams B and C: the Bragg reﬂected beam B and
the transmitted beam C. The angle between the two
beams corresponds to the relative transferred momen-
tum Δp/p.
When entering the second standing light ﬁeld both
beams B and C are again split into a diffracted and
a transmitted beam. Far away from the two light ﬁelds,

Fig. 12.37. Scheme of the atom interferometer. The incoming
atomic beam A is split into two beams. Beam C is transmitted
and beam B is Bragg-reﬂected from a standing light wave.
The beams are not exactly vertical, because a Bragg condi-
tion must be fulﬁlled. After free propagation for a time tsep
the beams are displaced by a distance d. Then the beams are
split again with a second standing light wave. In the far ﬁeld,
a spatial interference pattern is observed
the interference between beam D and E and between F
and G is observed.
Now a microwave with frequency ωmw ≈3 GHz is
added to the device, which induces transitions between
the hyperﬁne components F = 2 and F = 3 in the
2S1/2 state of 85Rb (Fig. 12.38). The laser frequency is
tuned halfway between the |2⟩→|e⟩and the |3⟩→|e⟩
transitions. The detuning then has equal magnitudes but
opposite signs.
The wave function of the atoms experience a phase
shift upon Bragg reﬂection, that depends on the inter-
nal state of the atom. For atoms in state |2⟩the detuning
is negative, the atom sees a negative light shift po-
tential and suffers a phase jump of π upon reﬂection
(which is equivalent to the reﬂection of a light wave at
an optically thinner medium), while atoms in state |3⟩
see a positive light shift potential and do not suffer a
phase shift.

Fig. 12.38a,b. Storage of which way information. (a) Sim-
pliﬁed level scheme of 85Rb. The excited state (52P3/2) is
labelled |e⟩. The ground state (52S1/2) is split into two hy-
perﬁne sates with total angular momentum F = 2 and F = 3,
which are labeled |2⟩and |3⟩, respectively. The standing light
wave with angular frequency ωlight induces a light shift for
both ground states which is drawn as a function of position.
(b) The beam splitter produces a phase shift that depends
on the internal and external degree of freedom. A Ramsey
scheme, consisting of two microwave π/2 pulses, converts
this phase shift into a population difference (see text)
This phase shift can be converted into a pop-
ulation difference when the microwave represents
a π/2-pulse converting the internal state of the atom in-
to a superposition (|3⟩+ |2⟩)/
√
2. After having passed
through the ﬁrst light ﬁeld, the internal state of the
Bragg-reﬂected atoms is changed into (|3⟩−|2⟩)/
√
2,
while the transmitted atoms are still in the superpo-
sition state (|3⟩+ |2⟩)/
√
2. Now the atoms are again
exposed to a π/2-pulse of the second microwave ﬁeld,
which brings the transmitted atoms back to state |3⟩and
the reﬂected atoms to state |2⟩. We can now distinguish
between the reﬂected and the transmitted beam, be-
cause the two beams contain atoms in different states.
The question is now, whether the “which way in-
formation” destroys the interference pattern behind the
second standing light ﬁeld. The experiment proves that
indeed the interference fringes disappear.
The mere fact that the information is stored
and could be read out always destroys the in-
terference, even if this information is not really
read out! Also when it is read out, there is no
interference observed.
The novelty of this result is, that there is a negligible
recoil by the absorption of the microwave. Therefore
the smearing out of the interference structure by the
momentum transfer in the Gedanken experiment for
the modiﬁed Young’s two-slit interference is not the
real reason for the disappearance of the interference
structure, but the possible knowledge about the path the
atoms have taken instead.
The somehow strange state that describes the situ-
ation where a particle can go one way, as well as the
other, is called an entangled state. Such a state does
not appear in classical physics and it is a typical quan-
tum mechanical phenomenon. Its properties lead to
some surprising results, which have been the subject of
great concern. After a controversial discussion between
Einstein and Bohr about the consequences, Einstein, to-
gether with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen wrote
a seminal paper that intended to illustrate, by a paradox
situation called the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox,
that quantum mechanics is incomplete. We will explain
it with the following example [12.40].
12.5.2 The Einstein–Podolski–Rosen Paradox
We consider the emission of two photons hν1 and
hν2 into opposite directions by an atom on a cascade
transition from the upper state 1S via an intermediate
state 1P to the ground state 1S (Fig. 12.39). Since the
angular momentum of the atom before and after the
emission is L = 0, the two photons have to have op-
posite spin orientations, i.e., one has σ + the other σ −
polarization. Unless ν1 ̸= ν2 and we can measure the
frequencies, we do not know, which of the two photons
is σ + and which is σ −polarized.

If, however, the detector D1 measures the polariza-
tion state of the photon emitted to the left side, we can
tell which polarization state of the photon emitted to
the right side is measured by D2. Even if the two detec-
tors are separated by a large distance, the measurement
of D2 is determined by the result of D1. For a long time
the controversial dispute was about the question, how
the information obtained by the measurement at D1 is
communicated to D2. The situation is even more as-
tonishing, when the polarizer in front of detector D1 is
switched to the other polarization state after the photon
has been emitted by the atom but before it reaches D1.
Even now the detector D2 measures the opposite state
of polarization as the new state of D1. Can informa-
tion between the detectors be transmitted with a speed
greater than the speed of light?
Einstein believed that quantum theory could not be
complete, that there might be “hidden parameters” that
had not yet been detected [12.40]. Theoretical proofs
given by J.S. Bell [12.41] and experiments performed
by A. Aspect [12.42], have shown, however, that there
are no hidden parameters. The paradox can be ex-
plained, if quantum theory is regarded as a nonlocal
theory. This means that the description of microparti-
cles is not bound to a speciﬁc location. The two photons
represent an entangled state, where the physical pa-
rameters of one photon are determined by those of the
other.
The paradox can also be explained in the following
way. Two particles with spin up or down are emitted by
a source into two opposite directions. We know that the
total spin of the two particles must be zero, because the
emitting source has zero angular momentum. The wave
function of the system can be described as
|ψ⟩=
1
√
2
(|↑⟩|↓⟩+ |↓⟩|↑⟩) .
(12.41)
After the particles are far apart and do not interact with
each other, we measure the spin of the particle emitted
to the right side. Then we know its spin and we can
predict the spin of the other particle. This means that
its spin is determined by the knowledge of the spin of
the other particle.
The situation of this paradox is similar to that of
Young’s two-slit experiment and can be explained in
the same way [12.40, 43].
12.5.3 Schrödinger’s Cat
Erwin Schrödinger used an illustrative example to
show that quantum mechanics at this time still had
some unanswered questions about the validity of en-
tangled states.
Assume a cat is put in a black box where two
switches can be activated by the cat. One switch does
nothing, the other opens a bottle with poisonous gas
that kills the cat immediately. There is no informa-
tion transferred from the inside to the outside of the
box. The observer from the outside only knows that
one of the switches has been opened by the cat, but
he does not know which of the two. He therefore does
not know whether the cat is dead or alive. From a quan-
tum mechanical point of view the cat is therefore in an
entangled state (12.46) and is simultaneously dead and
alive. Our common sense tells us that this is nonsense.
The question is, how far the concept of entangled
states can be transferred to the macroscopic world. We
remember that entangled states can only be formed
from a coherent superposition of states. The coher-
ence is destroyed by relaxation processes. The larger
the number of atoms, the higher the probability of re-
laxation. Therefore, systems with many atoms, which
have been coherently prepared at time t = 0 loose
this coherence within a time interval, which decreas-
es rapidly with increasing number of atoms. Haroche
and coworkers have shown that even for a system of
three atoms, the coherence generated by simultaneous
absorption of a pulse laser lasted for less than a few mi-
croseconds [12.44]. Therefore entangled states for a cat
with more than 1025 atoms cannot exist.
12.5.4 Entanglement and Quantum Bits
The which way experiments discussed in the previous

of quantum states, where ψa describes the quantum
state of the system when only path “a” is open and
path “b” is closed and ψb the state when path “b” is
open and “a” is closed. This coherent superposition
plays the possibly essential role in quantum comput-
ers [12.45]. While a classical computer operates with
bits (this is a system that allows two possible values 0

and 1), a quantum computer is based on qubits, which
are represented by a two-level system that can be in
the levels |0⟩and |1⟩. Unlike classical computers, the
quantum systems have the possibility of coherence and
superposition of states.
The general state of the system can be described by
the qubit
|Q⟩= α|0⟩+ β|1⟩
with
|α|2 + |β|2 = 1 ,
(12.43)
which is a coherent superposition of the two states |0⟩
and |1⟩. If we measure the qubit, we will ﬁnd that it
has the value |0⟩with the probability |α|2 and the val-
ue |1⟩with the probability |β|2. This seems to bear an
uncertainty, but the important point is that for a coher-
ent superposition one can always ﬁnd a basis in which
the value of the qubit |Q⟩is well deﬁned. This can be
illustrated by a simple example.
If we consider the speciﬁc state
|Q⟩= (|0⟩+ |1⟩) /
√
2
(12.44)
the qubit will be with 50% probability in state |0⟩and
with 50% in state |1⟩. With the so-called Hadamar
transformation
H(0) →
1
√
2
(|0⟩+ |1⟩) , H(1) →
1
√
2
(|0⟩−|1⟩)
(12.45)
the qubit |Q⟩of (12.44) is transformed into the well
deﬁned state |0⟩because H(Q) = |0⟩.
Note:
This Hadamar transformation is only possible for a co-
herent superposition of states. For an incoherent mix-
ture, such a transformation would not be possible
because in this case there will be a pure addition of
probabilities α2 and β2 (not of amplitudes α and β)
without any interference.
The Hadamar transformation can be physically re-
alized using a 50% beam splitter (Fig. 12.40). We will
denote a particle above the beam splitter to be in the
state |0⟩and below with |1⟩.
If α is the probability amplitude that the particle is
incident from above and β that for the particle incident
from below, the incident state can be characterized by

With a 50% beamsplitter the reﬂected and the transmit-
ted amplitudes are Aout = Ain/
√
2. If the amplitude of
the particle wave incident from below suffers a phase
jump of π upon reﬂection, its sign is reversed. Now
(α + β) is the probability amplitude for ﬁnding the par-
ticle in the upper outgoing direction and (α −β) for the
lower direction. The output state is therefore
|Q⟩out =

[(α + β)|0⟩+ (α −β)|1⟩]
= H|Q⟩in .

This is exactly the result of the Hadamar transforma-
tion (12.45).
The Mach–Zehnder interferometer in Fig. 12.41
corresponds to a sequence of two Hadamar transforma-
tions
|Q⟩out = H H|Q⟩in .

When the Hadamar transformations (12.45) are applied
to the general Qubit (12.42) one recognizes that

Fig. 12.42. Emission of two photon pairs in an entangled state
by the sequence S
This means that a Mach–Zehnder interferometer
has an output state that is identical to the input
state.
Assume a source S emits a pair of photons with
opposite momenta in such a way that one photon is
emitted to the right and the other in the opposite direc-
tion to the left (Fig. 12.42). If the photon to the left is
emitted into the upper half space the photon to the right
has to be emitted into the lower half space, because
both photons of a pair should be antiparallel, otherwise
the total momentum would not be zero. In our descrip-
tion by qubits, the left photon, which we call photon 1
is in the state |0⟩1 if it is in the upper beam and in the
state |1⟩1 if it is in the lower beam. Photon 2, emitted
to the right, is in the corresponding states |0⟩2 or |1⟩2.
Although we do not know which of the two photons
is in the upper or in the lower beam, we do know that
photon 1 is in the upper beam if photon 2 is in the low-
er one and vice versa. We can describe this situation by
a two-particle superposition state
|Q⟩e =
1
√
2
(|0⟩1|1⟩2 + |1⟩1|0⟩2) ,
(12.50)
which is an entangled state, as discussed above. It is
represented by a superposition of two qubits as prod-
uct states and has interesting properties. Neither of the
two qubits has a deﬁnite value. One cannot tell whether
qubit 1 is in the state “o” or in “1”. The same is true for
qubit 2. However, as soon as the value of one of the
two qubits has been determined by a measurement, the
other one has to have the opposite value.
The concept of entangled states plays a key role
for quantum computers and quantum communication
and cryptography. For entangled states the informa-
tion received by the right detector in Fig. 12.42 could
be predicted if a measurement at the left detector was
performed, even if the two detectors were far apart.
For more details see [12.45, 46, 47].
12.5.5 Quantum Gates
Any computer needs gates for performing mathemati-
cal operations. These can be, for example,“not-gates”,
“and-gates”, “or-gates” or “nor gates”. Their basic prin-
ciple is illustrated in Fig. 12.44. The “not-gate” can be
realized by a simple inverter: There is only one input
channel and one output. If the input is 1, the output is 0
and vice versa. The other gates consist of devices with
two input channels and one output channel. The input
signals can be 1 or 0 realized by different voltage steps.
The input voltages can trigger a ﬂip-ﬂop circuit to pro-
duce the output voltage. For the “or-gate” the output
is 1, if at least one of the input channels has the in-
put 1. For the “and-gate” the output is 1 only if both
input channels are 1, otherwise it is 0. The “nor-gate”
represents the inversion of the “or-gate”, i.e. the output
is 1 only if both input channels are 0.
These gates in a classical computer correspond to
quantum gates in quantum computers. One example is
the Hadamar gate
H =

√

which transfers the q-bit |0⟩at the input to the entan-
gled state (1/

(1/

Another example is the Pauli X-gate
X =

which corresponds to the classical NOT gate and trans-
fers the input q-bit |0⟩→|1⟩and |1⟩→|0⟩
or the Pauli Z-gate
Z =


which performs the transformations |0⟩→|0⟩and
|1⟩→−|1⟩.
If we would like to compute an arbitrary function by
reversible gates, we need another gate. One possibility
is the Toffoli gate, proposed in 1980 by Toffoli.
This gate has a 3-bit input and output. If the ﬁrst
two bits are set, it ﬂips the third bit as the following
table shows:

The Toffoli gate is universal; this means that
for any boolean function
f (x1, x2, . . . , xm), there
is a circuit consisting of Toffoli gates which takes
x1, x2, . . . , xm and some extra bits set to 0 or 1 and
outputs x1, x2, . . . , xm, f (x1, x2, . . . , xm), and some
extra bits (called garbage). Essentially, this means that
one can use Toffoli gates to build systems that will per-
form any desired boolean function computation in a
reversible manner [Wikipedia Toffoli gate].
The question is now how quantum gates can be re-
alized experimentally in such a way, that they can be
useful for quantum computers. There are several pro-
posals and we will here only mention one of them,
namely a linear array of ions, trapped in a linear Paul
trap (Fig. 12.44a). Such ions can interact with radiation
from two lasers tuned to speciﬁc wavelengths of a three
level scheme (Fig. 12.44b). The ground state |0⟩of the
ions is connected to an excited level |1⟩by a weak
transition, (e.g. a dipole forbidden transition), and to

Fig. 12.44. Realization of qubits and quantum gates by inter-
action of laser radiation with ions in a linear trap
another excited level |2⟩by a strong transition which
is used for cooling the ion and for detection of a quan-
tum jump from |0⟩to |1⟩. The two levels |0⟩and |1⟩
form a pair of entangled states and realize the qubit
|Q⟩= α|0⟩+ β|1⟩in (12.46). If a π/2-pulse is applied
to the transition |0⟩→|1⟩the two levels are equally
populated, while a π-pulse inverts the population. The
state of the qubit can be measured by the presence (the
ground state is occupied i.e. β = 0) or the absence (the
ground state is empty, i.e. α = 0) of ﬂuorescence in-
duced by the strong transition |0⟩→|1⟩. How can such
a qubit be transferred to another ion?
The Coulomb interaction between neighbouring
ions in the linear trap is by far the strongest interac-
tion. It differs for the different states |0⟩or |1⟩of the
ion. The laser-cooled ions perform small oscillations
around their equilibrium positions. Since they are all
trapped in the harmonic trap potential, there are certain
common normal oscillations of all ions (see Sect. 10.4,
where normal vibrations of linear molecules are dis-
cussed). Since the different ions are coupled by their
Coulomb interaction the excitation of one ion may
change the interaction with the neighbouring ions and
therefore the common normal oscillation mode of all
ions in the trap. If this change can be detected, the in-
formation has been transferred from one qubit of an
excited ion to the centre of mass motion of the ions.
From here it can be further transferred to the internal
state of another ion. This would represent a coherent in-
teraction between two qubits realizing the construction
of a quantum-gate.
If the laser beams are inclined against the axis
of the linear trap, the movement of the ion would
cause a deﬁnite Doppler-shift of its absorption frequen-
cy. The normal oscillation modes of the ions cause

sidebands in the absorption spectrum.The frequencies
of these sidebands differ for the different normal modes
If the laser wavelength is tuned to such a sideband, it
will only interact with ions, oscillating in this speciﬁc
mode.
As is shown in [12.48] a two qubit logic quantum
gate can be implemented with this device. In principle,
every quantum algorithm can be realised by using only
single- and two-qubit gates. This approach, however, is
unfavourable for more complex tasks and would rapid-
ly reach the limits of current implementations. Hence,
physicists worldwide strive for the efﬁcient realisa-
tion of multi-qubit gates. The scientists in Innsbruck
[12.48, 49] succeeded in implementing a three-qubit
gate acting on three trapped calcium ions representing
the qubits. The target qubit of the so-called Toffoli gate
will only be switched when both control qubits are set
to “1”, while in all other cases the target qubit will not
be changed.
This novel gate does not only augment the set of
available quantum gates, but also raises the achiev-
able efﬁciency. Thomas Monz, junior scientist at the
experiment, explains: “A Toffoli gate based on the con-
ventional approach would require a sequence of six
controlled switch operations. In comparison, our ap-
proach is three times faster while operating at a reduced
error rate.” Applications of the Toffoli gate lie with-
in quantum error correction or quantum mechanical
prime factorization. Thus, it represents an important
component of a future quantum computer.

Optical cooling of atoms means the reduction of
their velocity by momentum transfer from the ab-
sorbed photon to the counter-propagating atom.
Atoms in a gas are cooled in the three-dimensional
interaction region of six laser beams in the ±x,
±y, ±z directions, if the laser frequency is tuned
to the red side of the atomic absorption frequency.
•
Atoms can be trapped in a magneto-optical trap
(MOT) which consists of an anti-Helmholtz pair
of coils, producing a cylindrical symmetric inho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld which causes a Zeeman
splitting of the absorption line that increase with
increasing distance from the trap centre. The trap-
ping is caused by atomic recoil, due to photon
absorption which depends on the distance from
the trap centre.
•
The atomic ensemble inside the trap is called
optical molasses. The atoms in this molasses per-
form damped harmonic oscillations around the
trap centre.
•
The lower limit Tmin = hγ/kB of the tempera-
ture, achieved with optical cooling is set by the
random recoil of spontaneously emitted photons.
It depends on the homogeneous linewidth γ of
the optical transition. Lower temperatures can be
reached by evaporation cooling.
•
If the density of the cooled and trapped atoms
becomes so high, that the mean distance between
atoms becomes smaller than their deBroglie wave-
length, a phase transition to a new state of
matter occurs, called Bose–Einstein-condensation
(BEC).
•
Cold molecules can be produced by association of
two atoms with small relative velocity, achieved
by absorption of a photon by this atom pair
and subsequent stimulated emission into a sta-
ble molecular state. Another technique uses res-
onances with molecular bound states in a variable
magnetic ﬁeld (Feshbach resonances).
•
With femtosecond laser pulses online observa-
tions of dissociation of molecules are possible,
using a pump-and probe technique.
•
Coherent control means controlled shaping of
amplitude E(t) and phases ϕ(t) of ultrashort puls-
es by a thin mask of many liquid crystal pix-
els, with refractive indices that are controlled by
external voltages. If these pulses are absorbed
by molecules they can produce a wanted co-
herent superposition of wave-functions in the
excited molecular state and can suppress unwant-
ed combinations. This favours wanted chemical
reactions.
•
The output of a mode-locked laser consists of
many equidistant frequencies, called a frequency
comb. The separation of adjacent frequencies in
this comb equals the mode separation of the laser

518
12. Modern Developments in Atomic and Molecular Physics
cavity. The frequency comb can be used for ultra-
precise direct frequency-comparison between the
caesium clock in the microwave region with op-
tical frequencies and improves the measurements
of absolute optical frequencies by several orders
of magnitude.
•
New and more precise atomic clocks can be real-
ized with single ions, trapped in a Penning trap.
The very narrow forbidden transition in such ions
is used as the clock transition.
•
Squeezing means the reduction of amplitude noise
or phase noise below the uncertainty limit. If
the amplitude noise is pushed below this limit
the phase noise increases accordingly and vice
versa. It can be experimentally realized by Mach–
Zehnder interferometers where a nonli near ab-
sorption medium is placed in one of the interfer-
ometer arms.
•
Which way-experiments investigate the loss of co-
herence in the superposition of two partial beams
of a light source, if the way of the photons through
the device is known.
•
Entangled states represent a coherent superposi-
tion of atomic states. Such states are speciﬁc for
quantum mechanics. They do not exist in classical
physics. If one of the components of an entan-
gled state is measured, the other is known, even
if the pair of states is separated by long distances.
This is proved by measurements of the Einstein–
Rosen–Podolsky paradoxon, which can be only
explained if it is assumed that quantum mechanics
is a nonlocal theory.
•
Entangled states play an essential role in tele-
transportation of information and in quantum
computers, where they are used as q-bits instead
of bits in the classical computer.

d = 0.99803 ⇒β2 = 86.40◦.
The difference is Δβ = 0.6◦. For α = 88.94◦we
would obtain: Δβ = 0.75◦.

In order to set L = 4 f one has to determine
the focal length f . This is achieved by shifting
the aperture A2 until maximum transmission is
reached.
Assume the maximum deviation of the electrons
from the axis is a = 5 mm;
with
L = 100 mm
we obtain
⇒sin α ≈5
25 = 0.2 rad
(Fig. S.4). If the position of the focus is shift-
ed by ΔL from its optimum value, the radius
of the convergent electron beam is enlarged by
ΔL tan α from r0 to r0 + ΔL tan α. If the current I
of electrons ﬂows through the aparture with radius
r0 = 0.5 mm (can be measured within ΔI/I =
10−3) the shift can be seen, if the area of the

⇒ΔL/L = 1.25 × 10−5 .
The geometrical uncertainty of ΔL from the mea-
surement of L is therefore much larger than that
of the uncertainty of measuring the transmitted
current. The maximum relative error is therefore
not affected by the uncertainty of optimising the
transmitted current but rather by the mechanical
accuracy of length measurement.
b) The maximum deﬂection from the straight path
is δx < 10−3b, because the current I ∝b can
be measured within ΔI/I = 10−3. The deviation

The vertical deﬂection is
Δ1z = 1

2 · 9.81 · 6.72 · 10−6 m

= 2 × 10−5 .
The width of the beam at a distance d2 = 200 cm
downstream of S1 is:
Δ2z = d2 · Δϑ = 4 × 10−3 m .
The deﬂection by gravity therefore changes the
beam intensity, transmitted through a slit S2 by
the fraction 2.2 × 10−4/4 × 10−3 = 5.5 × 10−2 =
5.5%.

and a sensitivity of Δzmin = 10 μm than the min-
imum value of Δq is Δqmin = 6 × 10−35 C =
3.8 × 10−16 e.
c) The change Δz of the deﬂection is 2Δz =

If a relative change of 10−4 can be still measured,

The time difference ΔT for ions of equal mass,

For m =100 AMU= 1.66 × 10−25 kg, b = 2 mm,
d = 30 mm, L = 1 m one obtains:
ΔT1 = 1.018 × 10−5(5.769 −6.143)s
= −3.811 μs .
The ion with s = (d + b)/2 has a shorter ﬂight
time than an ion starting from s = (d −b)/2, be-
cause it is accelerated longer and has a larger
velocity.
Two ions, with masses m1 and m2, both starting
from the middle of the ionization volume (s =
d/2) have the ﬂight time difference:
ΔT2 = d + L

Inserting the numerical values for m1 =110 AMU,
m2 = 100 AMU gives:
ΔT2 = 1.49 × 108 × 2 × 10−14 s
≈3 μs .
Two masses can be separated if their ﬂight time
difference ΔT2 is at least ΔT1 or larger. The mass
resolution of our example is only Δm/m ≈10.
It can be greatly increased by the McLaren
arrangement with two different accelerating elec-
tric ﬁelds.
b) The increase of mass resolution in the reﬂec-
tron can be seen as follows: Assume the lengths of
the two arms of the reﬂectron to be L1 = L2 = L.
Two ions, generated at two different locations have
velocities v1 and v2 with vi = (2eE · si/m)1/2.
Their ﬂight time is: Ti = 2L/vi without penetrat-
ing into the reﬂection ﬁeld Er. Here they penetrate
a distance dr determined by the energy balance:
m
2 v2
i = e · Er · dr ⇒dr = mv2
i / (2eEr) .
The deceleration time is obtained from
dr = 1
2e Er
m t2 .
Their time for penetration and reﬂection is there-
fore
t = 2 · (2dr · m/eEr)1/2 .
Inserting si = (d ± b)/2 we obtain for the total
ﬂight time of an ion through the reﬂectron:
Ti = 2L
vi
+ 2mvi
eEr
.
Inserting si = (d ± b)/2 ⇒vi = [(2eE/m)(d ±

We can calculate the maximum time difference for
ions generated at si = (d ± b)/2 as:

where F is the force acting on the particle at
a distance r from the center.
For centro-symmetric force ﬁelds is

In order to estimate the maximum value of b (i.e.,
the smallest deﬂection angle ϑ) we assume bmax =
d/2, where d is the average distance between two
gold atoms in the scattering gold foil. In this case
the α-particle passes between two gold atoms and
experiences a net deﬂection force of zero.

This means that photoabsorption by a free electron

in the presence of an atom, which can compensate
the photon recoil. In the Compton effect the scat-

Since the left side of this equation depends solely
on t, the right side solely on r, both sides have to
be constant, which we name C. The right side gives
the time-independent Schrödinger equation (4.6)

For a potential well with depth E0 the potential
energy is Epot < 0 if we choose Epot = 0 outside
the well. In (4.26a) one has to change the sign
of E0. With the numerical data of Problem 4.2

Inserting the numerical values a = 0.7 nm, E0 =

c) With the exact solution for the potential well
with ﬁnite wall heights the wave functions are no
longer zero for x = 0 and x = a, but they penetrate
a little bit into the wall regions (Fig. S.6). As was
discussed in Sects. 4.2.2 and 4.2.4 we now have the

ψIII = A3e−αx

From the boundary conditions
ψIII(0) = ψII(0) ;
ψII(a) = ψIII(a)

we obtain:
A1 = A2 sin ϕ ,

A3 = A2 sin(ka + ϕ)e−αa .

From the continuity of the derivatives one obtains:

II(0) ⇒αA1 = k A2 cos ϕ .
This gives with (2):
α = k cot ϕ ⇒ϕ = arctan(k/α) .

ϕ = −ka −arccot(k/α) + nπ .

⇒Δm2 = 6.6 × 10−6m0 .
The difference is:
δm = Δm1 −m2

b) The energy difference is:
ΔE = E(2s) −E(1s) = 10 eV = 1.6 × 10−18 J .
The potential energy Epot = −2Ekin. Since
E = Epot + Ekin = 1
2 Epot ⇒Epot = 2 · E .
The difference in potential energy corresponds to
a mass difference
Δm = m1 −m2 = 2ΔE/c2
= −3.6 × 10−35 kg .
Both effects are opposite in sign. Because the rel-
ative velocity effect mv(1s) > mv(2s) is only 1/2
of the potential energy effect, the mass of the atom
is larger in the 2s state than in the 1s state.

For r = 10−18 m ⇒v = 2.5 × 1014 m/s. This is
a contradiction to the special theory of relativity
and shows that the model of a charged sphere for
the electron is not correct. The deﬁnition of the
electron spin as the angular momentum of a sphere

The potential energy of a magnetic dipole in a mag-
netic ﬁeld is:
E = −μ · B .
The magnetic moment of the proton is
μp = 2.79μK .
The separation of the two hyperﬁne components

partly from the fact that we have neglected the

A similar calculation for the 3s state gives:

⇒ΔEpot = 4.2 eV
because Ekin ≈−1

ΔE = ΔEpot + ΔEkin
≈1
2ΔEpot ≈2.1 eV .
This agrees fairly well with the experimental value
ΔEexp = 2.3 eV, obtained from the difference of
the wavenumbers ν(3s ↔1s) −ν(2s ↔1s) of the
two-photon allowed transition.
6.
The largest mean distance between the electrons
is realized if the total spin of all electrons has

546
Solutions to the Exercises
its maximum allowed value. Since for this case
the spin function is symmetric, the spatial part of
the wave function is antisymmetric with respect
to exchanging two electrons. This means that the
wave function ψ(r1, r2) has nodes for r1 = r2.
Therefore the potential energy of the mutual repul-
sion is minimized, which gives a minimum for the
total energy.
7.
With the screening constant S, the potential energy
of a Rydberg electron can be written as
Epot = −(Z −S)e2
4πε0r
.
For the total energy (note that Ekin = −1
2 Epot) we
obtain
E = −(Z −S)e2
8πε0r
= Ekin + Epot .
According to the Rydberg formula (6.32) the
energy can be also expressed by
E = −−(Z −S)2Ry∗
n2

Ry∗
(n −δ)2 .
The comparison yields the relation
S = Z −

between the screening constant S and the quantum
defect δ. For δ →0 we obtain S = Z −1, which
means a Coulomb potential with Zeff = Z −S =1.

The radius r μ

The potential energy of the electron with the wave
function ψ(r) is (see Problem 6.1)
Epot = +e

|ψ(r)|2φ(r) dr .
For the 3s electron the probability to ﬁnd the elec-
tron inside the n = 2 shell is larger than for the
3p electron, because the 3p-functions has a node
at r = 0. Therefore the shielding of the nuclear
charge is smaller for the 3s electron than for the
3p electron. The potential energy is lower and
therefore its total energy.
10. The potential energy of the second electron in the

The crude approximation gives a binding energy

of the second electron. It is higher than the ex-
perimental value of −2.5 eV, because we have
neglected the repulsion between the two electrons.

With Ry∗= 13.6 eV one obtains:
Z2

⇒Zeff = 1.26 .
The nuclear charge Ze with Z = 3 is screened by
the two 1s electrons by 1.74e.
For the Rydberg level with n = 20 we obtain:
Z2
eff(n = 20) = 400 × 0.034
13.6
≈1
⇒Zeff = 1 .
For high Rydberg levels the screening of the nu-
clear charge Ze is nearly complete by the (Z −1)
electrons of the atomic core.
12. For all alkali atoms there is a single electron in the
valence shell with principal quantum number n =
2 (Li), n = 3 (Na), n = 4 (K), n = 5 (Rb), n = 6
(Cs). The larger the n is, the better the shielding
of the nuclear charge Ze by the Z −1 electrons
in the core. This implies that Zeff decreases with
increasing n and the binding energy of the valence
electron (this is the ionization energy of the atom)
decreases with increasing n.
The experimental technique for the determination
of the binding energy is, for instance, the photoion-
ization of the atom.
A(En) + hν →A+ + e−(Ekin) .
One can measure the frequency νg, where
Ekin(e−) = 0 ⇒−En = hν .
The approximate calculation of the binding energy
is based on the Hartree method (see Sect. 6.4.2),
which converges rapidly because the charge dis-
tribution of the core electrons, which form closed
shells is spherically symmetric. The valence elec-
tron moves in a spherical potential, which is nearly
a Coulomb potential (∼1/r) for larger r, but
deviates from it for small r.

Since the nozzle diameter is small compared to b
we can regard the nozzle as a point-like source of
atoms. The transverse velocity distribution f (vx) is
determined by |vx| < v sin ε. The reduced Doppler
width is then:
(δνD)beam = δνD(v) sin ε .
With sin ε = 5 × 10−3 and δνD = 3.06 × 1010 s−1

10. a)
From
the
Einstein
coefﬁcient
Aik = 3 ×
10−15 s−1 = 1
τ we obtain the natural line width of
the HFS transition with λ = 21 cm
δνn = Aik
2π = 5 × 10−16 s−1 .
The natural line width of the HFS transition is
therefore extremely narrow. The Doppler width is
δνD = 7.16 × 10−7 3 × 108
0.21
√
10 s−1 = 3.2 kHz .
The collision broadening is:

With vr =

πm = 460 m/s with m =
m1m2
m1+m2
⇒δνcoll = 7.3 × 10−20 s−1 .
The collisional broadening is therefore completely
negligible. For the Lyman α-line we obtain:
δνn = Aik
2π = 1.6 × 108 s−1 ,
δνD = 5.6 × 109 s−1 ,
δνcoll = 7.3 × 10−13 s−1 .
The Doppler width is by far the prominent broad-
ening.
b) At a temperature T = 10 K the ratio of the
populations is
N(F = 1)
N(F = 0) = 3 · e−hν/kT ≈3 · 0.994 .
The population difference is
ΔN = N(F = 0) −1
3 N(F = 1)
= 0.006 · N(F = 0) .
The absorption coefﬁcient is
α =
(
N(F = 0) −1
3 N(F = 1)
)
· σabs
= 0.006 · N(F = 0) · σabs .
With σabs = 3 × 10−26 m2, N = 106 m−3 and L =
3 × 1016 m we obtain
α · l = 5.4 × 10−6 .
The absorption of the 21 cm line is therefore
negligible. For the Lyman α-line the situation is
different:
α = σ · N = 1 × 10−15 · 106 m−1 = 10−9 m−1 .
After 109 m the intensity has decreased to (1/e)I0.
The interstellar cloud with L = 3 × 1016 m is
therefore completely opague. Lyman-α-light is
completely absorbed.
c) The natural line width of the methane transition

a) The frequencies νm of the resonator modes are
ν = c
λ = m · c
2L
because
L = mλ/2 .
With L =1 m, ν =5×1014s−1 ⇒m =3.33×106,
L = L0(1 + αT ) ,
ΔL = L −L0 = L0αΔT
= 1 × 12 × 10−6 × 1 m
= 1.2 × 10−5 m ,

= ΔL
L
= 1.2 × 10−5
⇒Δν = 1.2 × 10−5 × 5 × 1014 s−1
= 6 × 109 s−1 .
Since the mode distance is only ΔνL = 150 MHz
the laser frequency jumps during the temperature
change after a shift of about Δν/2 ≈75 MHz back
to the next mode. Temperature tuning alone does
not allow a continuous frequency shift of more than
75 MHz, unless the resonator contains additional
frequency selective optical elements.
b) The refractive index n can be written as
n = 1 + aN ⇒n −1 ∝N ,
where N is the number density of air molecules.
If the air pressure changes by Δp = 10 mbar =
1%, the same relative change occurs for (n −1).
For air at atmospheric pressure is n −1 = 2.7 ×
10−4. The change for Δp = 1% is then Δ(n −1)
= 2.7 × 10−6. The optical path length inside the
resonator changes then by
Δ(nL) = 2.7 × 10−6 × 0.2 m = 5.4 × 10−7 m
⇒Δν = Δ(nL)
L
ν0 = 2.7 × 108 s−1 .
Also in this case the laser frequency jumps back to
the next resonator mode, if Δν > Δνm/2.

a circular aperture with diameter d the angular
divergence of the central diffraction maximum

c) Only 10% = 1 W can be used for the evapo-
ration. The mass of the evaporated material with
thickness D is
M = ϱ · πw2
0 D
= 8 × 103 π × 422 × 10−12 × 10−3 kg
= 4.4 × 10−11 kg .
The heat of evaporation is
We = 6 × 106 J/kg .
The necessary energy for evaporation is
W = We · M = 2.6 × 10−4 J .
The time needed for the evaporation of the mass M
is:
t = W/P = 2.6 × 10−4 s = 0.26 ms .
Since a considerable fraction of the absorbed en-
ergy is lost by heat conduction into the cold sur-
roundings, one needs, in fact, about ten times as
long, i.e. t = 2.6 ms.
6.
a) The minimum spectral width is
Δν ≥0.5/ΔT .
With ΔT = 10−14 s
⇒
Δν ≥0.5 × 1014 s−1.
For a wavelength λ = 600 nm this corresponds to
a spectral width
Δλ = 6 × 10−8 m = 60 nm .
b) The spatial pulse length is in the beginning:
Δs0 = cΔT
n
= 2 × 10−6 m = 2 μm .
After passing through a dispersive medium with
length L, the pulse length has broadened. The
difference of optical path length for the different
wavelengths λ within the spectral pulse proﬁle is
Δ(nL) = L dn
dλΔλ = L · 4.5 × 104 × 6 × 10−8
= 2.64 × 10−3 L .
In order to keep Δs ≤4 μm, the condition
1
n Δ(nL) = (Δs −Δs0) ≤2 μm
has to be fulﬁlled.
⇒L = n 2.0 × 10−6 m
2.64 × 10−3
= 1.1 × 10−3 m
= 1.1 mm ,
for n = 1.5. This means that after the passage
through a 1.1-mm thick glass plate the pulse length
has already doubled from 2 to 4 μm.
c) Because of the nonlinear, intensity-dependent
part of the refractive index the wavelength λ is red-
hifted during the pulse rise time (dI/dt > 0). It is
blue-hifted at the trailing edge (dI/dt > 0).
If the material is chosen in such a way that the
linear part of n in the surrounding of λ0 (cen-
tral wavelength of the spectral pulse proﬁle) shows
anomalous dispersion (dn/dλ > 0), the red part is
delayed more than the blue part of the pulse. This
compensates the opposite effect of the nonlinear
part of n. Complete compensation demands
d
dλ (n0(λ) + n2I) = 0 .

The resonator quality factor is deﬁned as
Qk = −2πν
Wk
dWk/dt ,
where
Wk(t) = Wk(0)e−γkt
is the energy stored in the kth mode of the res-
onator. If γk are the losses per round trip, the power
after one round trip has decreased to
P = P(0)e−γL .
The loss factor γL is composed of reﬂection losses
and other losses (diffraction, scattering, absorp-
tion). The reﬂection losses per round trip are
γ R = −ln(R1R2) = 0.02 .
If the other losses together are also 0.02, we obtain
γL = 0.04 .
Since the round trip time of a light wave in a res-
onator with mirror separation d is
T = 2d
c
the losses per sec and are
γ = γL/T = c
2d γL .
With d = 1 m
⇒
γ = 1.5 × 108 × 0.04 s−1 =
6 × 106 s−1. The quality factor is then for a fre-
quency ν = 5 × 1014 s−1:
Qk = 2π 5 × 1014
6 × 106
= 5.2 × 108 .
Per oscillation period of the light the power de-
creases by the fraction
η =
2π
5.2 × 108 = 1.2 × 10−8 .
It takes 1/γ ≈1.7 × 10−7 s until the power in the
resonator mode has decreased to 1/e of its initial
value.
8.
After one round trip the power has increased by the
factor
P1
P0
= e−(2αd+γ ) .
With a net gain −(2αd + γ ) = 0.05 we obtain
P1
P0
= e0.05 = 1.05 .
The time T for a round trip is
T = 2d
c = 2
310−8 s .
The time-dependent power then becomes:
P(t) = P0 exp
(
−2αd + γ
2d/c
t
)
.
With a mirror transmission T = 0.02 the output
power of 1 mW demands a power of 50 mW inside
the resonator. The initial power P(0) is given by
one photon, i.e.,
P(0) = hνc
2d = 4.5 × 10−10 W .

The kinetic energy of the electron can be obtained
from the energy relation
Ekin(e−) + Epot(e−) + Epot(protons)
= E(H) + EB ,
where EB is the binding energy of H+
2 and E(H) is
the energy in the groundstate of the H-atom.
⇒Ekin(e−) = −13.6 eV −2.65 eV + 32.2 eV
−13.6 eV
= 2.35 eV
This approximate method gives a too small val-
ue. The real value is Ekin = 12 eV, compared to
Ekin(H) = 13.6 eV.
2.
For R →0 the H2-molecules converge towards the
He-atom 2
2He. Therefore the energy of the electrons
has to converge towards the groundstate energy of
the He-atoms. (Note that the two missing neutrons
do not affect this energy.) This is, according to
Sect. 6.1:
E(He) = −78.9 eV .
This value can be composed of the energy
E1 = −2 × 4 × 13.6 eV = −108.8 eV
without repulsion between the two electrons, and
the Coulomb energy
E2 = +29.9 eV
of this repulsion.
The energy of the electron is:
Eel(H2, R = Re) = 2 · E(H) + EB(H2) −
e2
4πε0Re
,
where E(H) = −13.6 eV is the electronic energy
of the H-atom, EB(H2) = −4.7 eV is the bind-
ing energy of the H2-molecule and e2/(4πε0Re) =
0.3 × 10−17 J = 19.4 eV is the nuclear Coulomb
repulsion at a distance Re = 0.074 nm between the
two protons. The result is:
Eel(H2, R = Re) = −51.1 eV .

560
Solutions to the Exercises
This energy is composed of negative potential en-
ergy, due to electron–proton attraction, positive
potential energy of electron–electron repulsion and
positive kinetic energy of the two electrons.

a) The total energy of the rigid H2-molecule
(including Coulomb repulsion between the two
nuclei) is, according to (9.2)
E(H2) = 2E(H) + EB(H2)
= −27.2 eV −4.7 eV
= Eel(H2, Re) +
e2
4πε0Re
⇒Eel(H2, Re) = −19.4 eV −31.9 eV
= −51.3 eV .
In order to separate the H2-molecule into 2 elec-
trons and 2 protons one has to put the ener-
gy E = Eel(H2, Re) −e2/(4πε0Re) = 31.9 eV in-
to the molecule.
b) At a temperature of 300 K the mean vibrational
energy is: Evib = kT (potential + kinetic energy of
the vibrating nuclei). The rotational energy (2 de-
grees of freedom for rotations around two possible
axis perpendicular to the internuclear axis) is
Erot = 2 · 1
2kT = kT
⇒Evib + Erot = 2kT .
The relation between kT and E is:
1 eV ˆ= kT
for
T = 11,604 K .
⇒at T = 300 K:
2kT ˆ= 2 ·
300
11.604eV = 52 meV .
This is very small compared to the electronic ener-
gy difference Eel ≈10 eV between the ﬁrst excited
electronic state and the groundstate of H2.
The correct calculation of Evib and Erot has to take
into account the quantization of the energy levels.
The population of a level (v, J) is:
N(v, J) =
(2J + 1)e−(Erot+Evib)/kT

v,J=0(2J + 1)e−(Erot+Evib)/kT

The linear molecule C2H2 with 4 atoms has 3 ·

are therefore 5 different vibrational frequencies

vibrational ground state to excited vibrational
states are infrared active, if the dipole moment of

where μ is the reduced mass.
For the normal vibration ν1 the C-atom remains at
rest and the two O-atoms oscillate with opposite
phases (Fig. S.16). The restoring forces for the two

reduced mass is

According
to
the
Walsh diagram in Fig. 10.11 the energy of the
(2a1)-orbital and of the (1b2)-orbital decreases
from α = 90◦to α = 180◦, while that of the
(3a1) strongly increases. The total energy has
a minimum (from an estimation of the curves in
Fig. 10.11) at α ≈125◦–135◦. The correct value is
α = 131◦.
b) In the ﬁrst excited state the electron in the
(3a1)-orbital is excited into the (1b1)-orbital.
The energy of this orbital is independent of α
and therefore the excited state leads to a lin-
ear conﬁguration (α = 180◦) which is labelled as
(2σg)2(2σu)2(1πu)1A2πu.

The energy width of the femtosecond pulse with
Gaussian time proﬁle, for which Δν·ΔT =0.44 is
ΔE = h · Δv = 0.44h/ΔT .
With ΔT =2 × 10−14 s ⇒ΔE =1.5 × 10−20 J =
0.09 eV. The energy separation of the vibrational
levels is
ΔE = 1
2(E(v + 1) −E(v −1))
= 1
2hc [2ωe −(4v + 2)ωexe] .
For v = 20 this gives with ωe = 30 cm−1, ωexe =
0.04 cm−1
ΔE = 1
2hc [2ωe −82ωexe]
= 5.61 × 10−22 J = 3.5 × 10−3 eV .
The laser pulse can therefore excite

The intensity at the output of the Michelson inter-
ferometer is:

where Δϕ = 2π · Δs/λ is the phase difference be-

The phase of a plane wave is sensitive to the po-
sition of the plane mirror surface, averaged over
the whole surface. Deviations from an ideal plane,
caused by the atomic structure, are averaged out.
