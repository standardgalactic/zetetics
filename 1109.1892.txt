Abstract: This essay is a discussion of  the concept of eigenform
and its relationship with the foundations of physics.
I. 
Introduction
Our  essay begins with explication of the notion of eigenform as
pioneered by Heinz von Foerster in his papers [4, 5,6,7] and
explored in papers of the author [11, 12, 22, 23]. In [5] The familiar
objects of our existence can be seen as tokens for the behaviors of
the organism, creating apparently stable forms.
Such an attitude toward objects makes it impossible to discriminate
between the object as an element of a world and the object as a
token or symbol that is simultaneously a process.
The notion of an eigenform is inextricably linked with  second order
cybernetics. One starts on the road to such a concept as soon as one
begins to consider a pattern of patterns, the form of form or the
cybernetics of cybernetics. Such concepts appear to loop around
upon themselves, and at the same time they lead outward to new
points of view.  Such circularities suggest a possibility of
transcending the boundaries of a system from within.  When a
circular concept is called into being, the boundaries turn inside out.
 An object , in itself , is a symbolic entity, participating in a network
of interactions, taking on its apparent solidity and stability from
these interactions. We ourselves are such objects, we as human
beings are "signs for ourselves",  a concept originally due to the
American philosopher C. S. Peirce [10]. Eigenforms are mathematical
companions to Peirce's work.
In an observing system, what is observed is not distinct from the
system itself, nor can one make a separation between the observer

and the observed. The observer and the observed  stand together in
a coalescence of perception. From the stance of the observing
system all objects are non-local, depending upon the presence of the
system as a whole. It is within that paradigm that these models begin
to live, act and enter into conversation with us.
The central metaphor of this paper is the temporal nexus where
time is implicit, and time is explicit and keeping time. In the nexus
there is neither form nor sign, motion nor time. Time, the
measurement of time and time's indication all emerge at once from
the nexus in the form of action that is embodied in it. The metaphor
suggests that it is no accident that deeper physical reality is revealed
when mere numerical time t is replaced by the time of the nexus it.
The time of the nexus is at once flowing, beyond motion, an
eigenform, a geometric operator and a discrete dynamics counting
below where counting cannot go. The author hopes that Heinz will
understand his attempt to say what cannot be said. The sound of the
nexus is silence when it is truly read.
II. Objects as Tokens for Eigenbehaviours
In his paper "Objects as Tokens for Eigenbehaviours" [5] von
Foerster suggests that we think seriously about the mathematical
structure behind the constructivist doctrine that perceived 
worlds
are worlds created by the observer.  At first glance such a statement
appears to be nothing more than solipsism.  At second glance, the
statement appears to be a tautology, for who else can create the rich
subjectivity of the immediate impression of the senses? In that paper
he suggests that the familiar objects of our experience are the fixed
points of operators.  These operators a r e  the structure of our
perception. To the extent that the operators are shared, there is no
solipsism in this point of view.  It is the beginning of a mathematics
of second order cybernetics.
Consider the relationship between an observer O and an "object" A.
"The object remains in constant form with respect to the observer".
This constancy of form does not preclude motion or change of
shape.  Form is more malleable than the geometry of Euclid.  In fact,
ultimately the form of an "object" is the form of the distinction that
"it" makes in the space of our perception.  In any attempt to speak
absolutely about the nature of form we take the form of distinction
for the form. (paraphrasing Spencer-Brown [3]). It is the form of
distinction that remains constant and produces an apparent object
for the observer. How can you write an equation for this?  We write

O(A) = A.
The object  A  is a fixed point for the observer O .  The object is an
eigenform.  We must emphasize that this is a most schematic
description of the condition of the observer in relation to an object
A .   We record only that the observer as an actor (operator)
manages to leave the (form of) the object unchanged.  This can be a
recognition of symmetry, but it also can be a description of how the
observer, searching for an object, makes that object up (like a good
fairy tale) from the very ingredients that are the observer herself.
And what about this matter of the object as a token for
eigenbehaviour?  This is the crucial step. We forget about the object
and focus on the observer.  We attempt to "solve" the equation
O(A) = A with A  as the unknown. Not only do we admit that the
"inner" structure of the object is unknown, we adhere to whatever
knowledge we have.
We can start anew from the dictum that the perceiver and the
perceived arise together in the condition of observation. This is
mutuality. Neither perceiver nor the perceived have priority over
the other. A distinction has emerged and with it
a world with an observer and an observed. The distinction is itself
an eigenform.
III. The Eigenform Model
We have seen how the concept of an object has evolved.  The notion
of a fixed object has become the notion of a process that produces
the apparent stability of an object. This process can be simplified in
modeling to become a recursive process where a rule or rules are
applied time and time again.  The resulting object is the fixed point
or eigenform of the process, and the process itself is the
eigenbehaviour.
In this way we have a model for thinking about object as token for
eigenbehaviour.   This model examines the result of a simple
recursive process carried to its limit.
For example, suppose that

F(X) = 
X
Figure 1
Each step in the process encloses the results of the previous step
within a box. Here is an illustration of the first few steps of the
process applied to an empty box X:
X
F(X)
F(F(X))
F(F(F(X)))
Figure 2
If we continue this process, then successive nests of boxes resemble
one another, and in the limit of infinitely many boxes, we find that
...
X=F(F(F(...)))=
...
F(X) =
= X
Figure 3
the infinite nest of boxes is invariant under the addition of one more
surrounding box. Hence this infinite nest of boxes is a fixed point
for the recursion. In other words, if X denotes the infinite nest of
boxes, then

 X = F(X).
This equation is a description of a state of affairs.  The form of an
infinite nest of boxes is invariant under the operation of adding one
more surrounding box.
In the process of observation, we interact with ourselves and with
the world to produce stabilities that become the objects of our
perception. These objects, like the infinite nest of boxes, often go
beyond the specific properties of the world in which we operate.
We make an imaginative leap to complete such objects to become
tokens for eigenbehaviours. It is impossible to make an infinite nest
of boxes. We do not make it. We imagine it. And in imagining that
infinite nest of boxes, we arrive at the eigenform.
Sometimes one stylizes the structure by indicating where the
eigenform X reenters its own indicational space by an arrow or
other graphical device. See the picture below for the case of the
nested boxes.

Figure 4
An object is an amphibian between the symbolic and imaginary
world of the mind and the complex world of personal experience.
The object, when viewed as process, is a dialogue between these
worlds. The object when seen as a sign for itself, or in and of itself,
is imaginary. The perceiving mind is itself an eigenform of its own
perception.
IV. The Square Root of Minus One

The purpose of this section is to place i, square root of minus one,
and its algebra in the context of eigenform and reflexivity.
We describe a process point of view for complex numbers.
Think of the oscillatory process generated by
R(x) = -1/x.
The fixed point would satisfy
i = -1/i
and multiplying, we get that
ii = -1.
On the other hand the iteration of R  yields
+1, R(1) = -1, R(R(1)) = + 1, -1, +1, ....
The square root of minus one is a perfect example of an eigenform
that occurs in a new and wider domain than the original context in
which its recursive process arose. The process has no fixed point in
the original domain.
Looking at the oscillation between +1 and -1, we see that there are
naturally two viewpoints that we denote by [+1,-1] and [-1,+1].
These viewpoints correspond to whether one regards the oscillation
at time zero as starting with +1 or with -1.
We shall let I{+1,-1} stand for an undisclosed alternation or
ambiguity between +1 and -1 and call I{+1,-1} an iterant. There are
two iterant views: [+1,-1] and [-1,+1].
Given an iterant [a,b], we can think of [b,a] as the same process
with a shift of one time step.
These two iterant views, seen as points of view of an alternating
process, will become the square roots of negative unity, i and -i.
We introduce a temporal shift operator  !!!!   such that
[a,b]!!!!  = !!!!  [b,a] and !!!!  !!!!   = 1
for any iterant [a,b], so that concatenated observations can include
a time step of one-half period of the process
...abababab... .

We combine iterant views term-by-term as in
[a,b][c,d] = [ac,bd].
We now define i by the equation
i = [1,-1]!!!!  .
This makes i both a value and an operator that takes into account a
step in time.
We calculate
ii = [1,-1]!!!!  [1,-1]!!!!   = [1,-1][-1,1]!!!!  !!!!   = [-1,-1] = -1.
Thus we have constructed the square root of minus one by using an
iterant viewpoint.  i represents a discrete oscillating temporal
process and it is an eigenform for R(x) = -1/x, participating in the
algebraic structure of the complex numbers.
The Temporal Nexus
We take as a matter of principle that the usual real variable t for
time is better represented as it so that time is seen to be a process,
an observation and a magnitude all at  once.
This principle of "imaginary time" is justified by the eigenform
approach to the structure of time and the structure of the square
root of minus one.
An example of the use of the Temporal Nexus, consider the
expression x2 + y2 + z2 + t2, the square of the Euclidean distance
of a point (x,y,z,t) from the origin in Euclidean four-dimensional
space. Now replace t by it, and find
x 2  + y2 + z2  + (it)2
= x2  + y2  + z2  - t2 ,
the squared distance in hyperbolic metric for special relativity. By
replacing t by its process operator value it we make the transition
to the physical mathematics of special relativity.
V. Quantum Physics, Eigenvector, Eigenvalue and Eigenform

The reader should recall the Temporal Nexus from Section IV.
We take as a matter of principle that the usual real variable t for
time is better represented as it so that time is seen to be a process,
an observation and a magnitude all at  once.
The reader should recall that a vector is a quantity with magnitude
and direction, often pictured as an arrow in the plane or in three
dimensional space.
A vector V
V
Figure 5
In quantum physics [11], the state of a physical system is modeled
by a vector in a high-dimensional space, called a Hilbert space. As
time goes on the vector rotates in this high dimensional space.
Observable quantities correspond to (linear) operators H  on these
vectors v that have the property that the application of H  to v
results in a new vector that is a multiple of v by a real factor """".
(An operator is said to be linear if H(av +w) = aH(v) + H(w) for
vectors v and w, and any number a. Linearity is usually a simplifying
assumption in mathematical models, but it is an essential feature of
quantum mechanics.)
In symbols this has the form
Hv = """"v .
One says that v is an eigenvector for the operator H , and that """" is
the eigenvalue.
The  theory of eigenforms is a sweeping generalization of quantum
mechanics shifting eigenvectors to eigenforms.
This is a reversal of epistemology, a complete turning of the world
upside down. Eigenform has tricked us into considering the world of
our experience and we find that it is our world, generated by our

actions. The world has become objective through the self-generated
stabilities of those actions.
VI. The Wave Function in Quantum Mechanics
One can regard  a wave function such as #### (x,t) =exp(i(kx - wt))
as containing a micro-oscillatory system with the  special
synchronizations of the iterant view  i = [+1,-1]!!!!  . It is these
synchronizations that make the big eigenform of the exponential
#### (x,t) work correctly with respect to differentiation, allowing it to
create the appearance of rotational behaviour, wave behaviour and
the semblance of the continuum.
One can blend the classical geometrical view of the complex
numbers with the iterant view by thinking of a point that orbits the
origin of the complex plane, intersecting the real axis periodically
and producing, in the real axis, a periodic oscillation in relation to
its orbital movement in the higher dimensional space.
VII. Time Series and Discrete Physics
We have just reformulated the complex numbers and expanded the
context of matrix algebra to an interpretation of i as an oscillatory
process and matrix elements as combined spatial and temporal
oscillatory processes (in the sense that [a,b] is not affected in its
order by a time step, while [a,b]!!!!  includes the time dynamic in its
interactive capability, and 2 x 2 matrix algebra is the algebra of
iterant views [a,b] + [c,d]!!!! ).
We now consider elementary discrete physics in one dimension.
Consider a time series of positions
x(t), t = 0, $$$$ t, 2$$$$ t, 3$$$$ t,,,,    ... . We can define the velocity v(t) by
the formula
v(t) = (x(t+ $$$$ ) - x(t))/$$$$ t    ====    D x ( t )
where D denotes this discrete derivative. In order to obtain v(t) w e
need at least one tick  $$$$ t of the discrete clock.  Just as in the iterant
algebra, we need a time-shift operator to handle the fact that once
we have observed v(t), the time has moved up by one tick.
Thus we shall add an operator J that in this context accomplishes
the time shift:
x(t)J = Jx(t+$$$$ t).

We then redefine the derivative to include this shift:
Dx(t) = J(x(t+ $$$$ ) - x(t))/$$$$ t    ....
The result of this definition is that a successive observation
of the form x(Dx) is distinct from an observation of the form
(Dx)x. In the first case, we observe the velocity and then x is
measured at t + $$$$ t . In the second case, we measure x at t and then
measure the velocity.
We measure the difference between these two results by taking a
commutator [A,B] = AB - BA and we get the following formula
where we write  $$$$ x = x(t+ $$$$ t) - x(t).
[x,(Dx)] = x(Dx) - (Dx)x
= (J/$$$$ t)(x(t+ $$$$ t) - x(t))2
= J ($$$$ x)2/$$$$ t
This final result is worth marking:
[x,(Dx)] = J ($$$$ x)2 /$$$$ t .
From this result we see that the commutator of x and Dx will be
constant if ($$$$ x)2/$$$$ t = K is a constant. For a given time-step,  this
means that ($$$$ x)2 = K $$$$ t  so that  $$$$ x =  + %%%%(K $$$$ t ) or  - %%%%(K $$$$ t ).
This is a Brownian process with diffusion constant equal to K .
VIII. Epilogue and Simplicity
Finally, we arrive at the simplest place.
Time and the square root of minus one  are inseparable in the
temporal nexus. The square root of minus one is a symbol and
algebraic operator for the simplest oscillatory process.
As a symbolic form, i is an eigenform satisfying the equation
i = -1/i.
One does not have an increment of time all alone as in classical $$$$t.
One has i$$$$t, a combination of an interval and the elemental dynamic
that is time. With this understanding, we can return to the
commutator for a discrete process and use i$$$$ t for the temporal
increment.

We found that discrete observation led to the commutator equation
[x,D x] = J ($$$$ x)2/$$$$ t
which we will simplify to
[q, p/m] = ($$$$ x)2 /$$$$ t .
taking q for the position x and p/m for velocity, the time derivative
of position.
Understanding that $$$$t should be replaced by i$$$$t, and that, by
comparison with the physics of a process at the Planck scale one can
take
 ($$$$ x)2 /$$$$ t = h/ m ,
we have
[q, p/m] = ($$$$ x)2 /i $$$$ t = -i h/ m ,
whence
[p,q] = ih,
and we have arrived at Heisenberg's fundamental relatiionship
between position and momentum. This mode of arrival is predicated
on the recognition that only  i $$$$ t represents a true interval of time.
In the notion of time there is an inherent clock or an inherent shift
of phase that is making a synchrony in our ability to observe, a
precise dynamic beneath the apparent dynamic of the observed
process. Once this substitution is made, once the correct imaginary
value is placed in the temporal circuit, the patterns of quantum
mechanics appear.
The problem that we have examined in this paper is the problem to
understand the nature of  quantum mechanics. In fact, we hope that
the problem is seen to disappear the more we enter into the present
viewpoint. A viewpoint is only on the periphery. The iterant from
which the viewpoint emerges is in a superposition of
indistinguishables, and can only be approached by varying the

viewpoint until one is released from the particularities that a point
of view contains.
