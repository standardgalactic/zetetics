Introduction
A
re you thinking about building your own electronic gizmos? Ever wonder
how transistors, capacitors, and other building blocks of electronics
work? Do you have an interest in finding out how to solder or make your own
circuit boards?
Well, you’ve come to the right place! Electronics For Dummies is the key that
opens the fun and exciting door of modern electronics. No dry and boring
tome, this; what you hold in your hands is a book that gives you just what
you need to know to make and troubleshoot your own electronic gadgets.
Why Buy This Book?
Electronics is a huge — no, make that HUGE — subject. Like any science, it
consists of a lot of concepts and all sorts of highly complicated mathematical
equations. For any really in-depth study of electronics, you need to spend
hours and hours memorizing a lot of facts and figures.
But this book takes a different path. It provides you with just what you need to
understand the basics of electronics, get to work building electronic circuits,
and even tackle a dozen fun projects that you can build in under an hour each
for just a few dollars. This book doesn’t pretend to answer all your questions
about electronics, but it does give you a good grounding in the essentials and
makes this exciting science fun!
Why Electronics?
This is a rhetorical question because you no doubt already know why you
have an interest in electronics, or you wouldn’t have picked up this book. But
we’ll take a moment to review the things that make electronics well worth
your while.
First off, electronics is fun! You get to build things that beep, whir, flash lights,
and even move around the room. You acquire skills so that you can work with
neat tools and proudly hold your head up at any gathering of electronics geeks.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

And don’t forget that electronic products are all around us. They make up
a growing part of our lives. Some people are content just accepting these
gadgets, gizmos, and widgets, but others want to know how they all work.
Obviously, you’re in that second group, which is definitely the cooler group
out there. The science of electronics has advanced to the point that you can
now hold a very powerful computer in the palm of your hand. With that com-
puter, you can build something that controls the lighting in your entire house,
a robot that vacuums the living room all on its own, or a sensor system that
sounds an alarm if somebody tries to get at your collection of 1950s comic
books.
Here’s the amazing part: You can make electronic gadgets that do these things
for just a couple of bucks! At the same time that the art and science of electron-
ics is rapidly advancing, the price for building a circuit that can do something
incredibly nifty is dropping like a stone. Unless you’re constructing a time
machine, or the world’s largest robotic rabbit, the typical home-brewed elec-
tronics project costs less than dinner for four at a no-frills restaurant. If you’re
looking for a cool hobby, electronics is one of the least expensive ones around.
Oh, and did I mention that electronics is fun?
You may also want to consider this possibility: People who know the practi-
cal side of electronics — what things are, how they work, and how to put
them together — can find some really great jobs on the market right now. If
you’re interested in a career in electronics, make this book your first step to a
fun and rewarding new job.
Also, many other hobbies rely on knowledge of electronics in some way. Maybe
you’re into model railroading. You can figure out how to build your own auto-
mated track switchers. Or perhaps you like racing radio-controlled cars. With
an understanding of electronics, you may discover how to improve the perfor-
mance of your car and beat your best friend in the next race. Knowing more
about how electronics stuff works can make your other hobbies more fun.
And, last but not least, electronics is fun. Or maybe I mentioned that already?
Foolish Assumptions
This book assumes that you know diddly about electronics. From the very
first chapter, we introduce you to basic concepts that you need to master
in order to follow what we say in later chapters. But if you already have a
handle on the basics, you can easily jump to a later chapter and dive right in.
(If you need to know something really important to keep you safe from some-
thing such as electrocution, we provide a cross reference to send you back to
the relevant chapter for a refresher course.)

You can also use the most-excellent table of contents at the front of the book
and the index that Wiley has thoughtfully provided at the back to quickly find
the information that you need.
Safety Is Number 1
Reading about electronics is pretty safe. About the worst that can happen is
that your eyes get tired from too many late nights with this book. But actually
building electronics projects is another matter. Lurking behind the fun of the
electronics hobby are high voltages that can electrocute you, soldering irons
that can burn you, and little bits of wire that can fly into your eyes when you
snip them off with sharp cutters. Ouch!
Safety is Numero Uno in electronics. It’s so important, in fact, that we devote an
entire chapter of this book (Chapter 2) to it. If you’re brand new to electronics,
please be sure to read this chapter. Don’t skip over it, even if you think you’re
the safest person on earth. Even if you’ve dabbled in electronics before, it
never hurts to refresh your safety memory. When you follow proper precau-
tions, electronics is a very safe and sane hobby. Be sure to keep it that way!
Although we try to give you great advice about safety throughout, we can’t
possibly give you every safety precaution in the world in one book. In addi-
tion to reading our advice, use your own common sense, read manufacturer’s
instructions for parts and tools that you work with, and always stay alert.
How This Book Is Organized
Electronics For Dummies is organized so that you can quickly find, read, and
understand the information that you want. It’s also organized so that if you
have some experience with electronics, you can skip chapters and move on
to the parts that interest you.
The chapters in this book are divided into parts that also help you find the
information that you’re looking for quickly and easily.
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics
Start with Part I if you’re brand-spanking new to electronics. Because this book
is designed to get you on the road to electronics as quickly as possible, this
part has only two chapters, an overall introduction to electronics concepts and
safety information. Please read Chapter 2, “Keeping Humans and Gadgets Safe,”
even if you decide to skip the introduction to electronics you find in Chapter 1.

Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack:
Stocking Up
If you’re just starting out in electronics, you probably need a couple of tools.
Read about the most important ones in Chapter 3, “Outfitting Your
Electronics Bench.”
You can’t make a project out of thin air. You need resistors, diodes, capacitors,
and other building blocks of today’s electronics. Chapters 4 and 5 explain
what each of the most important electronics components does and how often
you use each in building a circuit.
Part III: Putting It on Paper
If you’ve ever seen an electronics diagram, you probably thought it looked like
Egyptian hieroglyphics. In Chapter 6, we explain all about how to read these
diagrams (they’re called schematics), and you can discover how to follow a
schematic to determine the basic functionality of a circuit in Chapter 7.
Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty
At this point, you’re ready to start building your own electronics projects.
The chapters in Part IV tell you how to solder and how to use three of the
most important testing tools in electronics — the multimeter, logic probe,
and oscilloscope. You don’t absolutely need the last two to get started with
electronics, so you can come back to Chapter 10 a few months from now if
you’re just starting out.
Part V: A Plethora of Projects
In Chapters 11 and 12, we demonstrate how to build your own circuits. We
cover how to construct temporary circuits on something called a solderless
breadboard. Then you discover how to produce permanent circuits using
several methods, or by designing and ordering printed circuit boards from
a supplier. Chapter 13 introduces you to the exciting universe of microcon-
trollers, electronic circuits that you can program to do any of a million things.
And finally, in Chapters 14 and 15, you can play with over a dozen fun (and
not too complicated!) projects that you can build yourself.

Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part contains several chapters laid out in top-ten-list format. Here, you
explore some optional testing tools that you can add to your electronics
bench as you gain more experience; get advice about where to find electron-
ics parts; and finally, study useful electronics formulas that don’t require a
degree in math.
Icons Used in This Book
We’re a graphical society, bombarded with images from blockbuster movies
and computer games, and so this book uses little graphic icons to visually
point out useful information that you may want to know about.
The Tip icon indicates information that may help save you time, headaches,
or money (or all three!). These icons tend to point out tasty morsels that
make electronics more enjoyable, so don’t just skip ‘em!
Uh-oh! Something bad is about to happen — if you don’t read the text that
follows the Warning icon, that is. Some of these point out cautions to avoid
personal injury, and others give you advice on avoiding damage to tools,
components, circuits, or your pocketbook.
Think of Remember icons as gentle nudges about important ideas or facts that
you really should keep in mind while exploring the electronics world. We also
use these icons to note where in the book some subject is originally introduced,
so you can flip back to those chapters for a refresher, if you need one.

hen you plug in the coffee maker in the morning, you’re using electric-

That’s great. But before you can jump into playing with wires and batteries, it
helps to understand what puts the elec in electricity and electronics.
In this chapter, you discover all about how electrons make electricity and how
harnessing that electricity is the basis of electronics. You also get an introduc-
tion to some of the tools and parts that you can play with in the electronics
projects in Chapters 14 and 15.
Just What Is Electricity?
Like most things in life, electricity is more complex than you may think. A lot
of conditions have to come together to make that little spark when you touch
a doorknob or provide the power to run a supercomputer. To understand
how electricity works, it helps to break it down into its parts.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

First, you take an electron
Electrons are one of the building blocks of nature. Electrons are buddies with
another of nature’s building blocks, protons. Electrons and protons are very
small and are contained in . . . well, everything. A speck of dust contains mil-
lions and millions of electrons and protons, so you can imagine how many
there are in your average sumo wrestler.
Electrons and protons have equal and opposite electric charges, with elec-
trons having the negative charge and protons the positive. Opposite charges
are attracted to each other. You can visualize a similar type of attraction by
putting the ends of two magnets together. If the ends of the magnets are
opposite poles, the magnets cozy right up to each other and stick together.
If the ends of the magnets are the same pole, the magnets will move apart like
two politicians in a heated debate. In a similar way, because electrons and
protons have opposite charges, they are attracted to each other just as you
can see opposite magnetic poles attracting. The attraction between electrons
and protons acts like glue on a microscopic scale, holding matter together.
Although protons stay reasonably static, electrons are adventurous little fel-
lows who don’t like to just sit around at home. They can, and often do, move
from one object to another. Walk across a carpet on a dry day and touch a
doorknob; electrons traveling between your finger and the doorknob cause
the spark that you feel and sometimes see. Lightning is another example of
electrons traveling between two things — in this case, between a cloud and
the ground. These examples both show electricity in an unharnessed state.
Moving electrons around 
through conductors
What do electrons use to travel from one place to another? The answer to that
question gives you the next piece of the electricity puzzle. Although you may
use your old Chevy to get around, electrons use something called a conductor.
Electricity is simply the movement of electrons through a conductor.
A lot of materials can act as conductors, but some are much better at it than
others. Electrons can move more easily through metal than through plastic.
In plastic, even though all the electrons are moving around their proton bud-
dies, they pretty much stay in their own backyard. But in metal, the electrons
are free to move all over the place. Free electrons in metal act like marbles
thrown on an ice-skating rink. The electrons glide through the metal like the
marbles slide across the ice. Plastic, an insulator, is more like sand. Marbles
don’t go much of anywhere if you throw them into a sandbox, and neither do
electrons in an insulator.
10
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics

So which materials are good conductors and which are good insulators? Most
folks use copper and aluminum as conductors. In fact, electronics projects
often use copper wire conductors. Plastic and glass are commonly used
insulators.
Resistance is the measurement of the ability of electrons to move through a
material. A copper wire with a large diameter has lower resistance to the flow
of electrons than a copper wire with a small diameter. You need to understand
resistance because almost every electronics project you do involves a resistor.
Resistors have controlled amounts of resistance, which allows you to control
the flow of electrons in a circuit.
Voltage, the driving force
The previous sections in this chapter explain how electrons move and that
they move more freely in a conductor. But some kind of force has to pull the
electrons from one place to another. This attractive force between positive
and negative charges is an electromotive force called voltage. Negative elec-
trons move toward a positive voltage by way of a conductor.
Remember Ben Franklin’s adventure flying a kite in a storm? The spark he
produced that night gave him an understanding of how an electric current
moves. In Ben’s case, electrons traveled down the wet string, which acted as
a conductor. (This was at least in part because the string was wet. Try this
same stunt with dry string and it doesn’t work nearly as well). The voltage
difference between the negatively charged clouds and the ground pulled the
electrons down the wet string.
Don’t try Franklin’s experiment yourself! By flying a kite in a storm, you’re
basically playing with lightning — which can effectively turn you into toast.
11
Chapter 1: From Electrons to Electronics
What happened to protons?
You may have noticed that we stopped talking
about protons. Although you should understand
the positive and negative charges in protons and
electrons, we’re focusing on electrons because
they’re more mobile than protons. In most cases,
it is electrons, and their negative charges, that
move through conductors and generate elec-
tricity. But in special cases, such as batteries,
positive charges also move through conductors.
To explain this process, you also have to get into
things called ions, atoms, electrochemical reac-
tions, and maybe even the concept of holes as
used in semiconductor physics. Because you
don’t need to understand these concepts to
complete the projects shown in this book (or
most hobbyist level projects), we’ll leave the
more complex physics to Einstein and keep our
focus on electrons.

An important combo: Electrons,
conductors, and voltage
Say that you have a wire (a conductor), and you attach one of its ends to the
positive terminal of a battery and the other end of the wire to the negative ter-
minal of the battery. Electrons then flow through the wire from the negative to
the positive terminal. This flow of electrons is referred to as an electric current.
When you combine electrons, a conductor, and voltage you create an electric
current in a form that you can use.
To help you picture how conductors and voltage affect the flow of electric
current in a wire, think of how water pressure and pipe diameter affect the
flow of water through a pipe. Here’s how this analogy works:
 Increasing water pressure causes more water to flow through the pipe.
This is analogous to increasing voltage, which causes more electrons to
flow, producing greater electric current.
 Using a larger diameter pipe allows more water to flow through the pipe
for a given amount of pressure. This is analogous to using wire with a
larger diameter, which allows more electrons to flow for a given voltage,
producing greater electric current.
Where Do You Get Electricity?
Electricity is created when voltage pulls an electric current through a conduc-
tor. But when you sit down and run a wire between a switch and a light, just
where do you get the juice (the electricity) to power that light?
12
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics 
Conventional current versus real current
Early experimenters believed that electric cur-
rent was the flow of positive charges. So they
described electric current as the flow of a pos-
itive charge from positive to negative voltage.
Much later, experimenters discovered electrons
and determined that the flow of electrons in
wires goes from negative to positive voltage.
The original convention is still with us today, —
so the standard is to depict the direction of elec-
tric current in diagrams with an arrow that
points opposite to the direction that electrons
actually flow. Conventional current is the flow
of a positive charge from positive to negative
voltage and is just the reverse of real current.

There are many different sources of electricity — everything from the old
walking-across-a-carpet-and-touching-a-doorknob kind to solar power. But to
make your life simple, this book takes a look at the three sources that you’re
likely to use for electronics projects: batteries, your wall outlet, and solar cells.
They just keep on going: Batteries
A battery uses a process called electrochemical reaction to produce a positive
voltage at one terminal and a negative voltage at the other terminal. The bat-
tery creates these charges by placing two different metals in a certain type of
chemical. Because this isn’t a chemistry book, we don’t get into the guts of a
battery here — but trust us, this is essentially what goes on.
Batteries have two terminals (a terminal is just a fancy word for a piece of
metal to which you can hook up wires). You often use batteries to supply
electricity to devices that are portable, such as a flashlight. In a flashlight,
the bulb has two wires running to the battery, one to each terminal. What
happens next? Something like this:
 Voltage pulls electrons through the wire from the negative terminal of
the battery to the positive terminal.
 The electrons moving through the wire pass through the wire filament in
the light bulb, causing the bulb to light up.
Because the electrons move in only one direction, from the negative terminal
through the wires to the positive terminal, the electric current generated by a
battery is called direct current, or DC. This is in contrast to alternating current
(AC) which is discussed in the following section, “Garden-Variety Electrical
Outlets.”
The wires on a battery must connect to both terminals. This setup allows
electrons to flow from one terminal of the battery, through the bulb, and all
the way to the other terminal. If the electrons can’t complete this kind of loop
between negative and positive, electrons don’t flow.
Garden-variety electrical outlets
When you plug a light into an electrical outlet in your wall, you’re using elec-
tricity that originated at a generating plant. That plant may be located at a dam
or come from another power source, such as nuclear power. Or it may be fired
by coal or natural gas. Because of the way electricity is generated at a power
13
Chapter 1: From Electrons to Electronics
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

plant, the direction in which the electrons flow changes 120 times a second,
making a complete turnaround 60 times a second. This change in electron
flow is called alternating current, or AC.
When the change in electron flow makes a complete loop, it’s called a cycle.
The number of cycles per second in alternating current is measured in Hertz,
abbreviated Hz. The example of a cycle in the previous paragraph is based on
the fact that the United States uses a 60 Hertz standard frequency; some
other countries use 50 Hertz as a standard, which means that the electrons
change direction 100 times a second. 
Electricity generated at a dam uses water to turn a coil of wire inside a huge
magnet. One of the properties of magnets and wires is that when you move a
wire near a magnet, a flow of electrons is induced in the wire. First, the magnet
causes the electrons to flow in one direction, and then, when the wire loop
rotates 180 degrees, the magnet pulls the electrons in the other direction. This
rotation creates alternating current.
Just plugging a cord into a wall outlet sounds easy enough, but you need
direct current for most projects, rather than alternating current. If you use
wall outlets to supply electricity for your project, you have to convert the
electricity from AC to DC. You can do this conversion with something called
a power supply. For an example of a power supply, think of the charger that
you use for your cell phone; this little device essentially converts AC power
into DC power that the battery uses to charge itself back up. You can find out
more about power supplies in Chapter 3. 
Safety, safety, safety. It’s an important issue for you to consider when decid-
ing whether to use the AC electricity that you get from wall outlets. Using the
electricity from a battery is like petting a house cat. Using the electricity from
wall outlets is more like cozying up to a hungry lion. With a cute tabby, you
may get your hand scratched; with the king of the jungle, you may be eaten
alive. If you think that you need to use electricity from a wall outlet for a pro-
ject, make sure that you know what you’re doing first. See Chapter 2 for spe-
cific advice about safety.
14
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics 
Which came first, voltage or current?
Batteries produce a voltage that drives an elec-
tric current. Generators at dams drive a current
that produces a voltage. Which comes first?
This is like asking yourself the well-known ques-
tion about the chicken and egg. Voltage, cur-
rents, and conductors all work together. If there
is a voltage applied across a conductor, electric
current flows. If you have an electric current
flowing through a conductor, there will be volt-
age across the conductor. Bottom line: Don’t
worry about which comes first.

Solar cells
Solar cells are a form of semiconductor. Like batteries, solar cells have wires
attached to two terminals. Shining light on a solar cell causes an electric cur-
rent to flow. (This reaction to light is a property of semiconductors and is
discussed in the sidebar “Getting fancy with semiconductors,” later in this
chapter.) The current is then conducted through wires to devices, such as a
calculator or a garden light beside the pathway to your front door.
Using a calculator containing a solar cell, you can demonstrate that the calcu-
lator depends on the light shining on the solar cell for its power. Turn the
calculator on and punch some numbers into the screen (choose a nice big
number, like your income tax). Now, use your thumb to cover the solar cell.
(The solar cell is probably near the top of the calculator in a rectangular
area with a clear plastic cover.) After you’ve covered up the solar cell for a
moment, the numbers fade away. Take your thumb off the solar cell, and the
numbers reappear. Things powered by solar cells need light to work.
Where Do Electrical Components Fit In?
Electrical components are parts you use in electronics projects. Simple enough,
right? You use some electrical components to control the flow of electricity,
such as a dimmer switch that adjusts the brightness of a light. Electricity
simply powers other electrical  components, such as speakers blasting out
sound. Still other electronic components, called sensors, detect something
(such as light or heat) and then generate a current to do something in
response, such as set off an alarm.
In this section, you meet some basic electrical components. Chapters 4 and 5
provide much more detail about components.
15
Chapter 1: From Electrons to Electronics
A simple choice: AC or DC
What difference does it make to you if you use
alternating or direct current? A lot of difference!
AC costs less to generate and send over trans-
mission lines than DC. That’s why you use AC for
many household electricity needs, such as
powering light bulbs and heaters.
However, DC is simpler to use for the pro-
jects discussed in this book (and many other
electronics applications). It’s just plain harder to
control AC current because you don’t know
which way it’s headed at any point in time. It’s
the difference between controlling traffic on a
two-way, six-lane highway, and controlling traf-
fic on a one-lane, one-way street. So, most of
the circuits you read about in this book use
direct current.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Controlling electricity
Electrical components, or parts, can control electricity. For example, a switch
connects a light bulb to electric current. To disconnect the light bulb and
make it go dark, the switch simply makes a break in the circuit.
Some other parts that control electricity are resistors, capacitors, diodes,
and transistors. You can find more information on these parts in Chapter 4.
Controlling electricity even better (ICs)
Integrated circuits, or ICs, are components that contain a whole bunch of
miniature components (such as resistors, transistors, or diodes, which you
hear about in Chapter 4) in one device that may not be much bigger than an
individual component. Because each IC contains many components, one little
IC can do the same job as several individual parts.
16
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics 
Getting fancy with semiconductors
Transistors, diodes, LEDs, integrated circuits, and
many other electronic devices use a semicon-
ductor instead of a conductor. A semiconductor
is a material, such as silicon, that has some of the
properties of both conductors and insulators.
Silicon is pretty cool stuff. In fact, they’ve named
a whole valley in California after it. In its pure
state, silicon conducts an electric current poorly.
But if you add contaminates, such as boron or
phosphorus, to the silicon, it conducts. When you
add phosphorus, silicon becomes an “n”-type
semiconductor. When you add boron, silicon
becomes a “p”-type semiconductor. An “n”-type
semiconductor has more electrons than a pure
semiconductor and a “p”-type semiconductor
has fewer electrons than a pure semiconductor.
When the regions containing boron and phos-
phorus are next to each other in silicon, you have
a “pn” junction. Current flows in only one direc-
tion across a “pn” junction. Diodes, components
that can convert AC to DC by limiting the flow of
current to one direction, are an example of a
component that contains a “pn” junction.
A “pn” junction generates an electric current
when exposed to light; this property is used when
building solar cells. On the other hand, when you
run an electric current through a “pn” junction, it
emits light, as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) do.
Transistors use junctions in which three adja-
cent areas have contaminants added. For
example, one region with phosphorus, one with
boron, and another with phosphorus result in an
“npn” junction. In a transistor, you apply a cur-
rent to the middle of the three regions (the
base), allowing a current to flow.
Most electronics projects you work on use com-
ponents such as transistors, diodes, and inte-
grated circuits, and these are made with
semiconductors. It’s semiconductors that have
made possible much tinier electronic gadgets
(like handheld computers and palm-sized radios).

An audio amplifier is one example of an IC. You can use audio amps to increase
the power of an audio signal. For example, if you have a microphone, its small
output signal is fed through an audio amplifier to make a strong enough signal
to power a speaker.
Another type of IC used in electronics projects is a microcontroller, a type of
integrated circuit that you can actually program to control cool gadgets like
robots. We discuss microcontrollers in more detail in Chapter 13.
Sensing with sensors
Certain electrical components generate a current when you expose them to
light or sound. You can use the current generated, together with a few of the
components listed in the previous sections that control electricity, to turn on
or off electronic devices, such as light bulbs or speakers.
Motion detectors, light sensors, microphones, and temperature sensors all
generate an electrical signal in response to a stimulus (motion, light, sound,
or temperature, respectively). These signals can then be used to turn other
things on or off. A high signal level might turn something on and a low signal
level turn something off. For example, when a salesperson walks up to your
house, a motion detector can turn on a light (or better yet, sound a general
alarm).
These signals take different forms, depending on the component supplying
them. For example, a microphone supplies an AC signal, and a temperature
sensor supplies a DC signal.
Figure 1-1 shows diagrams of a few signals that you run into often when work-
ing with electronics. These signals include
 + 5 Volt DC signal: A high input.
 0 volt DC signal: A low input.
 0 to 5 volt DC square wave: The output of an oscillator (a device that
cycles between high and low voltage); if you use this signal as input to a
light bulb, it causes the light to blink on and off.
 - 5 volt to + 5 volt AC sine wave: A signal, such as from a microphone,
that generates alternating current that a device, such as an amplifier,
uses as input. A microphone generates the waveform in Figure 1-1 when
it receives the sound produced by a tuning fork. Notice in Figure 1-1 that
the transitions from +5 volts to -5 volts are gradual for the sine wave and
more abrupt in the square wave.
You can find out more about various types of sensors in Chapter 5.

Powering up
Electricity can power electrical components to produce light, heat, sound,
motion, and more. For example, an electric current supplied to a DC motor
causes the shaft of the motor to rotate, along with anything you’ve attached
to that shaft.
You can power speakers, light bulbs, LEDs, and motors with electricity. If you

How Electricity Becomes Electronics
When you need to use electricity to make something work, such as a boom
box, you’ve entered the world of electronic gadgets. No doubt you’re eager to
start making your own electronic gadgets. We cover the basics of how elec-
tronics and gadgets interact in the following sections.
Creating a simple circuit
Take a battery, a resistor, an LED, and some wires, put them together, and you
have a simple electronic circuit. That’s all an electronic circuit is — wires con-
necting components so that a current can flow through the components and
back to the source.
Figure 1-2 shows a simple circuit. You place the parts in this circuit (also
called components) on something called a breadboard and connect those
parts with wires. If you’ve ever played with Mr. Potato Head, you understand
the principle of a breadboard. You stick things in the potato (ears, a hat,
eyes, and so on) to form a potato person. In the same way, a breadboard has
slots for you to insert electronic components to build a sample circuit. If
you’re really happy with what you’ve created, you can then use that design
to get a printed circuit board made. (See Chapter 11 for more information on
building circuits on breadboards.)

Figure 1-2 shows wires connected to both terminals of the battery in the cir-
cuit. This connection allows the current to flow from the battery, through the
LED and other components, and back to the battery to complete the circuit.
You can also complete the circuit by connecting parts of the circuit to the
metal chassis of a gadget, such as the metal housing of a stereo. We call this
connection a ground because it is used as the reference for all voltages in the
circuit. Ground may or may not be connected to the actual earth, but it is
always the reference from which you measure all other voltages. We discuss
grounding in detail in Chapter 6.
You can represent a circuit as a schematic. A schematic is just a drawing
showing how components are connected together by wires. Check out the
schematic for the circuit in Figure 1-2 in Figure 1-3. You can go to Chapter 6
for more on schematics.
Deciding what to build
If you’re itching to build a simple circuit to try out your skills, you can find sev-
eral circuits in Chapter 14. For example, you can create a breadboard circuit
that sounds an alarm when someone turns on a light in your room. Building
these projects is a fun way to get familiar with how to put together a circuit.
(But don’t jump right into projects if you’re a beginner — not until you’ve read
through a few chapters in this book, especially Chapter 2 about safety.)
After you put together some of the breadboard projects in Chapter 11 and
build up your basic skills, you can move on to the projects in Chapter 15,
such as constructing a small robot. These projects take more time, but they
can result in some truly neat gadgets.
After you’ve developed your skills building some of the projects in this
book, you can go farther. One place to get additional ideas is on the
Internet. Two sites we recommend are discovercircuits.com/ and www.
electronics-lab.com.

Along the Way You Get
to Play with Tools
One of the best things about building electronics projects is that you get to
tinker with tools and parts and see what you can make from them. You use
some tools to put the circuits together and some tools to check out how the
circuits you build are working.
Tools to build things
You’re probably glad to hear that you don’t need that many tools to get
started. You just need a wire cutter, needle-noise pliers, a wire stripper, and
a few screwdrivers to get started with the projects covered in Chapter 14.
If you design a circuit that you want to make more permanent, you need to
get a soldering pencil (also called a soldering iron) to attach the elements of
a circuit together. We cover choosing a soldering pencil in Chapter 8.
As you work with projects, no doubt other miscellaneous tools pop up that
you may want to get your hands on. You can use a magnet to retrieve screws
and other tiny things that you inevitably drop in hard-to-reach places, for
example. Check out Chapter 3 for details on outfitting your workbench.
Tools to measure things
When building or troubleshooting a circuit, you need to make measurements
to check that parts are working the way they should and that you designed
and built the circuit correctly. Tools that you can use to measure things
include a multimeter, an oscilloscope, and a logic probe. Chapters 9 and 10
cover the use of these tools.
We’ll take a moment to briefly tell you what you can use a multimeter for
because it’s the measuring tool that you buy first and possibly the only one
that you ever need.
Say you build a circuit, and you’ve just turned it on. What if the circuit doesn’t
work? With a multimeter, you can find out which part of the circuit is causing
the problem. You can measure voltage, resistance, and current at different
points on the circuit. For example, if there are 5 volts at one location on the
circuit and further along at another location your voltage suddenly drops to
0 volts for no logical reason you can make a good guess that your problem lies
between those two locations. You can then check (after the power is discon-
nected, please!) for loose wires or damaged parts between those two locations.

Before troubleshooting a circuit for problems, read Chapter 2 on safety. You
can very easily hurt yourself or your electronic gadget if you’re not careful.
The Wonderful World of Units
To understand the results of your multimeter measurements, you need to
understand electrical units. In the following sections, we run through the
basics with you.
Measuring things in units
Units simply tell you how much of something you have. For example, when
you buy apples, you measure how much they weigh in pounds (lbs). Similarly,
a multimeter measures resistance in ohms, voltage in volts, and current in
amperes (amps for short).
Table 1-1 shows common units and abbreviations used in electronics.

Getting to bigger or smaller units
If you’re measuring apples, you may have a tiny wedge of an apple (a fraction
of an apple) or a few pounds of apples, right? Electronics has much larger
ranges of units. You can have a single circuit using millions of ohms or
another one with a very small current (maybe a thousandth of an amp).
Talking about these very, very big numbers and very, very tiny numbers
requires some special terminology.

Electronics uses things called prefixes and scientific notation to indicate
small or large numbers. Table 1-2 shows common prefixes and scientific nota-
tions used in electronics.

So how does this 10-6 or 106 stuff work? Scientific notation is basically a short-
hand method of telling how many zeros to add to a number using our decimal
system, which is based upon powers of 10. For example, the superscript ‘6’ in
106 means place the decimal point six places to the right. 10-6 means move the
decimal point six places to the left. So, with 1 x 106, you move the decimal
point 6 places to the right of the 1, which gives you 1,000,000 or 1 million.
With 1 x 10-6, you move the decimal point 6 places to the left, giving you
0.000001 or 1 millionth. With 3.21 x 104, you move the decimal point 4 places
to the right, for a result of 32,100.
Prefixes + units = ?
The previous section shows you the abbreviations for prefixes and units.
This section tells you how to combine them. Combining these two results in
very compact notation. For example, you can write 5 milliamps as 5 mA or 3
megahertz as 3 MHz.

Just as you usually use a pound or so of apples to bake your average pie or
several tons of steel to build a suburban office park, in electronics, some things
just naturally come in small measurements and others in large measurements.
That means that you typically see certain combinations of prefixes and units
over and over. Here are some common combinations of notations for prefixes
and units:
 Current: pA, nA, mA, µA, A
 Inductance: nH, mH, µH, H
 Capacitance: pF, nF, mF, F
 Voltage: mV, V, kV
 Resistance: Ω, kΩ, MΩ
 Frequency: Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz
24
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics 
Exploring some new terms
Although we discussed resistance, voltage, and
current earlier in this chapter, some other terms
in this section may be new to you.
Capacitance is the ability to store a charge in an
electric field. This stored charge has the effect
of making decreases or increases of voltage
more gradual. You can use components called
capacitors to provide this property in many cir-
cuits. This figure shows the signal that occurs
when you decrease voltage from +5 volts to 0
volts, both with and without a capacitor.
+ 5 VOLTS
0 VOLTS
WITHOUT CAPACITOR
WITH CAPACITOR
Frequency is a measurement of how often an
AC signal repeats. For example, voltage from a
wall outlet undergoes one complete cycle 60
times a second. The following figure shows a
sine wave. In this figure, the signal completes
one cycle when the current goes from -5 to +5
volts then back down to -5 volts. If a signal
repeats this cycle 60 times a second, it has a
frequency of 60 hertz.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Using the information in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, you can translate these notations.
Here are some examples:
 mA: milliamp or 1 thousandth of a amp
 µV: microvolt or 1 millionth of a volt
 nF: nanofarad or 1 billionth of a farad
 kV: kilovolts or 1 thousand volts
 MΩ: megohms or 1 million ohms
 GHz: gigahertz or 1 billion hertz
The abbreviations for prefixes representing numbers greater than 1, such as
M for mega, use capital letters. Abbreviations for prefixes representing num-
bers less than 1, such as m for milli, use lowercase. The exception to this rule
(there’s always one) is k for kilo, which is lowercase even though it stands
for 1,000. 
25
Chapter 1: From Electrons to Electronics
Inductance is the ability to store energy in a
magnetic field; this stored energy resists
changes in current just as the stored charge
in a capacitor resists changes in voltage.
Components called inductors are used to pro-
vide this property in circuits.
Power is the measure of the amount of work
that electric current does while running through
an electrical component. For example, when
voltage is applied to a light bulb and current is
driven through the filament of the bulb, work is
done in heating the filament. In this example,
you can calculate power by multiplying the volt-
age applied to the light bulb by the amount of
current running through the filament.

The use of capital K is a special case reserved for kilohms; when you see a
capital K next to a number such as 3.3k, this translates as 3.3 kilohms.
You have to translate any measurement expressed with a prefix to base units
to do any calculation, as you can see in the following sections.
Understanding Ohm’s Law
Say that you’re wiring a circuit. You know the amount of current that the
component can withstand without blowing up and how much voltage the
power source applies. So you have to come up with an amount of resistance
that keeps the current below the blowing-up level.
In the early 1800s, George Ohm published an equation called Ohm’s Law that
allows you to make this calculation. Ohm’s Law states that the voltage equals
current multiplied by resistance, or in standard mathematical notation
V = I x R
Taking Ohm’s Law farther
Remember your high school algebra? Remember how if you know two things
(such as x and y) in an equation of three variables, you can calculate that
third thing? Ohm’s Law works that way; you can rearrange its elements so
that if you know any two of the three values in the equation, you can calcu-
late the third. So, here’s how you calculate current: current equals voltage
divided by resistance, or
I
R
V
=
You can also rearrange Ohm’s Law so that you can calculate resistance if you
know voltage and current. So, resistance equals voltage divided by current, or
R
I
V
=
So far, so good. Now, take a specific example using a circuit with a 12-volt bat-
tery and a light bulb (basically, a big flashlight). Before installing the battery,
you measure the resistance of the circuit with a multimeter and find that it’s 9
ohms. Here’s the formula to calculate the current:

What if you find that your light is too bright? A lower current reduces the
brightness of the light, so just add a resistor to lower the current. Originally,
we had 9 ohms; adding a 5-ohm resistor to the circuit makes the total resis-
tance 14 ohms. In this case, the formula for current is
.

Dealing with numbers both big and small 
Say that you have a circuit with a buzzer that has resistance of 2 kilohms and
a 12-volt battery. You don’t use 2 kilohms in the calculation. To calculate the
current, you have to state the resistance in the basic units, without using the
“kilo” prefix; in this example that means that you have to use 2,000 ohms for
the calculation, like this:
,

You now have the calculated current stated as a fraction of amps. After you
finish the calculation, you can use a prefix to restate the current more suc-
cinctly as 6 milliamps or 6 mA.
Bottom line: You have to translate any measurement expressed with a prefix
to base units to do a calculation.
The power of Ohm’s Law
Ohm (never one to sit around twiddling his thumbs) also expressed that
power is related to voltage and current using this equation:
P = V x I; or power = voltage x current
You can use this equation to calculate the power consumed by the buzzer in
the previous section:
P = 12 volts x 0.006 amps = 0.072 watts which is 72 milliwatts (or 72 mW)
What if you don’t know the voltage? You can use another trick from algebra.
(And you thought Mrs. Whatsit wasted your time in Algebra 101 all those years
ago!) Because V = I x R, you can substitute I x R into this equation, giving you
P = I2 x R; or power = current squared x resistance
27

You can also use algebra to rearrange the equation for power to show how
you can calculate resistance, voltage, and current if you know power and any
one of these parameters.
Do you really hate algebra? Did Mrs. Whatsit fail you those many years ago?
You’re probably happy to hear that online calculators can make these calcu-
lations much easier. Try searching on www.google.com using the keyword
phrase “Ohm’s Law Calculator” to find them. Also, check out Chapter 18. It

 Soldering without fear
 Wearing the right clothes for safety
You probably know that Benjamin Franklin “discovered” electricity in 1752
by flying a kite during a lightning storm. But actually, Franklin already
knew about electricity. He was really just testing a form of lightning conductor.
Though his experiment proved modestly successful, it was anything but safe.
Franklin almost killed himself, and if he had, whose picture would be on the
$100 bill?
Respect for the power of electricity is necessary when working with electron-
ics. In this chapter, we take a look at keeping yourself — and your electronic
projects — safe. This is the one chapter that you really should read from
start to finish, even if you already have some experience in electronics.
The Sixth Sense of Electronics
The sixth sense of electronics isn’t about seeing dead people. In this case, the
sixth sense is common sense, the smarts that help you stay among the living.
Common sense is that voice inside you that tells you not to stick your fingers
in an empty lamp socket without first unplugging the lamp.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

No book can ever teach you common sense. You have to cultivate it like an
exotic flower. But a few words to the wise may help get you started in your
quest for electronics common sense. For starters:
 Never assume. Always double-check. Pretend that your soldering pencil
is out to get you. Your family may think you’re crazy, but you’re less
likely to burn or electrocute yourself.
 If you’re not sure about how to do something, read up on it first. Not
everything in electronics is as obvious as it first appears.
 Don’t take chances. If you can make a 50/50 bet that something is plugged
in, give some thought as to what happens if you lose the bet this time.
Never let your guard down. Don’t ruin the fun of a wonderful hobby or voca-
tion because you neglected a few basic safety measures.
The Dangers of Electrical Shock
By far, the single most dangerous aspect of working with electronics is the
possibility of electrocution. Electrical shock results when the body reacts to
an electrical current — this reaction can include an intense contraction of
muscles (namely, the heart) and extremely high heat at the point of contact
between your skin and the electrical current. The heat leads to burns that
can cause death or disfigurement. Even small currents can disrupt your
heartbeat.
The degree to which electrical shock can harm you depends on a lot of fac-
tors, including your age, your general health, the voltage, and the current. If
you’re over 50 or in poor health, you probably won’t stand up to injury as
well as if you’re 14 and as healthy as an Olympic athlete. But no matter how
young and healthy you may be, voltage and current can pack a wallop, so it’s
important that you understand how much they can harm you. 
Electricity = voltage + current
To fully understand the dangers of electrical shock, you need to know the
basics of what makes up electricity. In Chapter 1, we state that electricity is
made up of two elements: voltage and current.
Voltage and current work hand-in-hand and in ways that directly influence the
severity of electrical shock. Consider the analogy of water flowing through a
pipe. Think of the water as representing the electricity. Increasing the diame-
ter of the pipe to let more water through is like increasing current. Imagine
being under a drain pipe for the Hoover Dam! Increasing the pressure of the
30
Part I: Getting Started in Electronics 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

water in the pipe is like increasing voltage. You know that even small
amounts of water at high pressure can be devastating. The same is true of
electricity, where even low voltages at high currents can potentially kill you.
Is it AC or DC?
You can describe electrical current as being either of the following
 Direct (DC): The electrons flow one way through a wire or circuit.
 Alternating (AC): The electrons flow one way, then another, in a 
continuing cycle.
If this stuff is new to you, you may want to go back and read Chapter 1 for a
more detailed discussion.
Household electrical systems in the U.S. and Canada operate at about 117
volts AC. This significantly high voltage can, and does, kill. You must exercise
extreme caution whenever you work with it.
Until you become experienced working with electronics, you’re best off
avoiding circuits that run directly off household current. Stay with circuits
that run off standard-size batteries, or those small plug-in wall transformers.
Unless you do something silly, like lick the terminal of a 9-volt battery (yes,
you get a shock!), you’re fairly safe with these voltages and currents.
The main danger of household current is the effect it can have on the heart
muscle. High AC current can cause severe muscle contraction, serious burns,
or both. And many electrocution accidents occur when no one is around to
help the victim.
Burns are the most common form of injury caused by high DC current.
Remember that voltage doesn’t have to come from a souped-up power plant
to be dangerous. For example, don’t be lulled into thinking that because a
transistor battery delivers only nine volts, it’s harmless. If you short the ter-
minals of the battery with a piece of wire or a metal coin, the battery may
overheat — and can even explode! In the explosion, tiny battery pieces can
fly out at high velocity, burning skin or injuring eyes.
Trying to not get electrocuted
Most electrocution accidents happen because of carelessness. Be smart
about what you’re doing, and you will significantly reduce the risk of being
hurt by electricity.
31
Chapter 2: Keeping Humans and Gadgets Safe
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Here are a few handy electrocution prevention tips:
 Avoid working with AC-operated circuits. Of course, you can’t always
do this. If your project requires an AC power supply (the power supply
converts the AC to lower-voltage DC), consider using a self-contained
one, such as a plug-in wall transformer. They’re much safer than a home-
made power supply.
 Physically separate the AC and DC portions of your circuits. This
helps to prevent a bad shock if a wire comes loose.
 Make sure you secure all wiring inside your project. Don’t just tape the
AC cord inside the project enclosure. It may pull out sometime, exposing
a live wire. Use a strain relief or a cable mount to secure the cord to the
enclosure. A strain relief clamps around the wire and prevents you from
tugging the wire out of the enclosure. You can buy a strain relief for elec-
trical cords at almost any hardware store or electronics shop. 
 Whenever possible, use a metal enclosure for your AC-operated pro-
jects, but only if the enclosure is fully grounded. You need to use a 3-
prong electrical plug and wire for this. Be sure to firmly attach the green
wire (which is always the ground wire; ground is used as a reference for
all voltages in a circuit) to the metal of the enclosure. 
 If you can’t guarantee a fully-grounded system, use a plastic enclosure.
The plastic helps insulate you from any loose wires or accidental electro-
cution. For projects that aren’t fully grounded, only use an isolated power
supply, such as a wall transformer (a black box with plug prongs which is
attached to a wire, such as you may have on your cell phone charger). You
plug the transformer into the wall, and only relatively safe low-voltage DC
comes out.
 Don’t be the class clown. Be serious and focused while you’re working
around electricity.
 Don’t work where it’s wet. “Yeah, duh!” you say. But you’d be surprised
what people sometimes do when they’re not paying attention. And
remember, just because you put liquid in a cup, that doesn’t mean you
don’t run the risk of knocking it over and getting things wet; consider
leaving your soft drink or coffee on an out of the way shelf when working
on your electronics project.
Practice the buddy system. Whenever possible, have a buddy nearby if you’re
working around AC voltages. You want someone around who can dial 9-1-1
when you’re lying on the ground unconscious. Seriously.
Getting a first aid chart
Of course, you’re the safest person on earth, and you will never be electro-
cuted. But just in case, get one of those emergency first aid charts that

Zaps, Shocks, and Static Discharge
One type of everyday electricity that is dangerous to both people and elec-
tronic gizmos is static electricity. They call it static because it’s a form of
current that remains trapped in some insulating body, even after you remove
the power source. With conventional AC and DC current, static electricity
disappears when you turn off the power source.
The ancient Egyptians discovered static electricity when they rubbed cat fur
against the smooth surface of amber. After they rubbed the materials together,
they tended to cling to one another by some unseen force. Similarly, two pieces
of cat fur that they rubbed against the amber tended to separate from each
other when the Egyptians drew those pieces together. Although the Egyptians
didn’t understand this mysterious force, they were aware of it. And they had
the scratched-up arms to prove it! (Note to Pharaohs: Best not to use live cats
for your electricity experiments.)

Carpets don’t shock, people do
Carpet shock hasn’t killed anyone (that we
know of, anyway). The amount of current is 
usually too low to harm your body. But, because
of their extremely small size, the same isn’t true
for electronic components. Static electricity of
just a few thousands volts, a mere tingle to
you (because the current is so very, very low),
can cause great harm to sensitive electronic
components.
As an electronics experimenter, remember to
take specific precautions against electrostatic
discharge, or ESD. See the section “Tips for
reducing static electricity,” later in this chapter,
for specific pointers. You can all but eliminate
damage from static discharge by taking just a
few simple steps to protect yourself, your tools,
and your projects from static buildup. The cost
for protecting against static electricity is mini-
mal; without knowing it, you may already be on
the road to preventing dangerous static buildup
in your electronics workshop.

Static electricity hangs around until it dissipates in some way. Most static
dissipates slowly over time, but in some cases, it gets released all at once.
Lightning is one of the most common forms of static electricity.
Designers make certain common electronic components to hold a static
charge, such as the ordinary capacitor (a component that provides the ability
to store energy in an electric field). Most capacitors in electronic circuits store
a very minute amount of charge for extremely short periods of time. But some
capacitors, most notably those used in bulky power supplies, can store near-
lethal doses for several minutes or even hours. Use caution when working
around capacitors that can store a lot of charge so you don’t get an unwanted
shock.
That guy from the $100 bill again
Benjamin Franklin, like other scholars of his time, understood quite a bit
about static electricity. One of Franklin’s many inventions was an early motor
that ran completely on static electricity. While Ben’s motor is little more than
a scientific curiosity today, it shows that static is a form of electricity, just
like AC or DC electricity.
Imagine a motor without a battery. Ben Franklin had to imagine this because
batteries weren’t invented until after he died. The honor of inventing the bat-
tery in the year 1800 goes to Alessandro Volta — hence the name of the unit
of measure for electromotive force (an attractive force between positive and
negative charges), the volt . And even though Franklin didn’t come up with
the battery, he first coined the term to describe his apparatus that collected
static in charged glass plates.
You can encounter static electricity now and then by doing nothing more
than walking across a carpeted floor. As you walk, your feet rub against the
carpet and your body takes on a static charge. Touch a metal object, such as
a doorknob or a metal sink, and the static quickly discharges from your body.
You feel that discharge as a slight shock.
How static can turn components
to lumps of coal
Electrostatic discharge involves very high voltages at extremely low currents.
Combing your hair on a dry day can develop tens of thousands of volts of
static electricity, but the current is almost so negligible you seldom notice it.
The low current prevents the static discharge from really hurting you when
you receive a shock. Instead, you just get an annoying tickle (and maybe a
bad hair day).

Many components that you use in electronic equipment, from simple transis-
tors to complex integrated circuits, are quite sensitive to even low amounts
of electrostatic discharge. Transistors and integrated circuits can be particu-
larly sensitive to high voltages, regardless of the amount of current. These
components include CMOS transistors, integrated circuits, and most com-
puter microprocessors. Other electronic components also are sensitive to
very high levels of electrostatic discharge, but you don’t normally encounter
these levels in everyday life. (You can read more about CMOS, transistors,
and other components in Chapter 4.)
Not all electrical components are static sensitive, but for safety’s sake, develop
static-safe work habits for all the components that you handle. Table 2-1 lists
the major electronic components and how susceptible they are to damage from
static discharge. Read Chapters 4 and 5 for more information on what these
components do.

Tips for reducing static electricity
You can bet that most of the electronic projects you want to build contain at
least some components that are susceptible to damage from electrostatic dis-
charge. You can take a number of simple steps to prevent exposing your pro-
jects to the dangers of electrostatic discharge:
 Use an anti-static mat. An anti-static mat acts to reduce or eliminate the
chance of static building up on your table and yourself as you work with
an electronic device. You can find anti-static mats in both table-top and
floor varieties. The table-top mats look like a sponge, but it’s really con-
ductive foam. You can (and should) test the conductivity of the mat by
placing the leads of a multimeter (a piece of testing equipment you can
35
Chapter 2: Keeping Humans and Gadgets Safe
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

read more about in Chapter 9) on either side of a length of the mat. Dial
the meter to ohms. You should get a definite reading and not an infi-
nitely open circuit (a circuit that has a break in it; see Chapter 7 for more
about circuits).
 Use an anti-static wrist strap. As a further aid in reducing static electric-
ity, also wear an anti-static wrist strap when working on electronic gear.
This wrist strap, like the one shown in Figure 2-1, grounds you at all
times and prevents static build-up. This strap is one of the most effec-
tive means of eliminating electrostatic discharge — and it’s one of the
least expensive. Most anti-static wrist straps cost under $5 and are
worth every penny. To use the strap, roll up your shirt sleeves and
remove watches, bracelets, rings, and any other metallic objects. Wrap
the strap around your wrist and make sure that it’s tight. Securely attach
the wire from the wrist-strap to a proper earth ground, as the instruction
sheet that comes with the strap explains.
 Wear low-static clothing. Your choice of clothing can affect the amount
of static build-up in your body. Whenever possible, wear natural fabrics,
such as cotton or wool. Avoid wearing polyester and acetate clothing
because these fabrics have a tendency to develop a whole lot of static. A
cotton lab overcoat not only looks trendy (in that geeky sort of way),
but it can reduce static electricity. Many chemical and industrial supply
houses sell lab coats for reasonable prices. You also can find suitable
overcoats, smocks, and aprons at many hardware stores.

Grounding your tools
The tools you use when building electronics projects can also build up static
electricity. A lot of it, in fact. If your soldering pencil operates from AC cur-
rent, ground it as a best defense against electrostatic discharge. There’s a
double benefit here: A grounded soldering pencil not only helps prevent
damage from electrostatic discharge but also lessens the chance of a bad
shock if you accidentally touch a live wire with the pencil.
Cheapo soldering pencils use only two-prong plugs and don’t have a ground
connection. You can’t find a really safe and sure means of attaching a ground-
ing wire to the soldering pencil, so the best bet is to just buy a new and better
pencil. You can purchase a grounded soldering pencil for less than $30, includ-
ing an assortment of tips.
As long as you ground yourself by using an anti-static wrist strap, you gener-
ally don’t need to ground your other metal tools, such as a wire wrapping
tool, screwdrivers, and wire cutters. Any static generated by using these
tools is dissipated through your body and into the anti-static wrist strap.
Working with AC Current
The vast majority of hobby electronics projects run on batteries. Simple
enough, but some projects need more current or higher voltages than batteries
can easily provide. Instead of building a power supply that converts household
AC current to a DC voltage for your project, you can make things much safer
for yourself by using a wall transformer to convert AC to DC (see Figure 2-2).
All the working parts are self-contained in the wall transformer. As long as
you don’t try to take it apart, you don’t expose the AC house current.
37
Chapter 2: Keeping Humans and Gadgets Safe
Where to get wall transformers — cheap!
You can purchase wall transformers (called
“wall warts” by some because they stick out of
the wall like an ugly wart) new or as surplus. Try
Radio Shack or a similar electronics store to buy
new wall transformers. You can get used and
surplus wall transformers by mail-order surplus;
check out Chapter 17 for some good leads.
And, of course, you may have a wall transformer
saved from a discarded cordless phone or other
electronic gadget. Check the voltage and cur-
rent rating, usually printed on the transformer, to
see if it’s suitable for your next project.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Sometimes, you need to work on a project that uses your 117 volt AC house
current directly. In those cases, you can’t resort to relatively safer batteries.
No hiding behind a wall transformer either. For these projects, always exer-
cise caution. Although you’re being super careful, you can further minimize
the hazards of working with circuits powered by AC house current by follow-
ing these basic guidelines:
 Always keep AC circuits covered. A little sheet of plastic works wonders.
 Never circumvent any fuse protection used on the device. Don’t use a
fuse with a too-high rating and don’t bypass the fuse altogether.
 When troubleshooting AC circuitry, keep one hand in your pocket at
all times. This prevents you from accidentally touching things with your
hand that you shouldn’t. Use the other hand to manipulate the testing
apparatus. Avoid the situation where one hand touches ground and the
other a live circuit. The AC can flow from one hand to the other, straight
through your heart.
 If possible, use the buddy system when working with AC circuits.
Always have someone nearby who can help you in case you get a nasty
shock.

Part I: Getting Started in Electronics 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Double- and triple-check your work before applying power. If possible,
have someone who knows a little about circuits inspect your handiwork
before you switch the circuit on for the first time.
 Periodically inspect AC circuits for worn, broken, or loose wires and
components and make any necessary repairs.
When testing AC-operated circuits, first remove the power. Unplug the power
cord, don’t just switch off the power at an outlet strip. You can easily tell
when you’ve pulled the plug from the socket, but it’s harder to tell if those
little electrons are still swirling around the outlet strip.
The Heat Is On: Safe Soldering
When soldering, you use a hot soldering pencil or gun, working with tempera-
tures in excess of 700 degrees Fahrenheit. To get an idea of what that tempera-
ture means, it’s the same as an electric stove burner set at high heat. You can
imagine how much that hurts if you touch it.
Most electronic projects or fix-it jobs call for a soldering pencil rather than
those big soldering guns that look like they’re rejects from a Buck Rogers
movie. Chapter 8 discusses soldering in more detail, but for now, keep the fol-
lowing safety tips in mind:
 Always place your soldering pencil in a stand designed for the job.
Never place the hot soldering pencil directly on a table or workbench.
You can easily start a fire or burn your hands that way.
 Be sure that the electrical cord doesn’t snag on the table or any other
object. Otherwise, the hot soldering pencil can get yanked out of its
stand and fall to the ground. Or worse, right into your lap!
 Soldering produces mildly caustic and toxic fumes. Make sure that
your electronics workshop has good ventilation to prevent a buildup of
these fumes. Avoid hunching over the soldering work because the fumes
can waft into your face. Yuck. If you’re having trouble seeing the solder-
ing joint at a distance, use a magnifying glass to enlarge the image of the
work.
 If your soldering pencil has an adjustable temperature control, dial
the recommended setting for the kind of solder that you’re using.
 If you’re concerned about stunting your growth and other health
issues, you may want to avoid solders that have lead in them. As an
alternative, you can use lead-free rosin-core solder specifically designed
for use on electronic equipment. Never use silver solder or acid-flux
solder in electronics, by the way. They wreck your circuits.
39
Chapter 2: Keeping Humans and Gadgets Safe
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Don’t try to solder on a live circuit — a circuit to which you’ve applied
voltage. You run the risk of damaging the circuit or the soldering pencil,
and you may receive a nasty shock.
 Never grab a soldering pencil as it falls to the ground. Just let it hit, and
buy a new one if the pencil is damaged. There’s an unwritten Murphy’s
Law in electronics that you will always grab the hot end. Trust me, a
burn from a hot soldering pencil is something you don’t ever want to
experience.
Wearing Body Armor
Okay, so we may sound like overprotective mothers advising you to bundle
up against the winter chill, but in the interest of practicing safe electronics,
be sure to wear proper clothing and body part protectors while you work.
Here are some specifics:
 Wear ear protection when using a high-speed drill or similar tool. Over
time, the loud noise of the motor can harm your hearing.
 Wear protective glasses when assembling circuits, especially during
soldering (this measure keeps out the solder fumes that can irritate
your eyes) and when cutting wires. You don’t want little wire bits flying
into your eyeballs, after all.
 Wear comfortable clothing, but avoid anything dangling or loose-fitting.
Roll up your sleeves, tuck in your shirttail, and if you’re the formal type,
remove your tie.
Avoid wearing metal jewelry when working around dangerous voltages. The
metal can burn you if you’re ever a victim of electrical shock. You probably
don’t need to worry about a ring, but you may want to reconsider that solid
gold necklace.

orget all this voltage, current, and resistor stuff. You probably want to
get down to the really fun part of electronics — the tools!
Every hobby has its special assortment of tools and supplies. Electronics is
no exception. From the lowly screwdriver to the high-speed drill, you enjoy
playing with electronics much more if you have the right tools.
You may have some or all of these tools already. If you do, you’re ahead of
the game. Gather them up, toss them into a toolbox, and skip on to the next
chapter. But if you’re tool-challenged in any way, don’t let it get you down.
You don’t have to own every tool discussed in this chapter, and you can col-
lect the ones you want as you go.
By the way, this chapter isn’t totally comprehensive. It doesn’t discuss sol-
dering tools or test equipment, for example. You can read more about tools
for soldering in Chapter 8. We cover test equipment, such as multimeters,
logic probes, and oscilloscopes, in Chapters 9 and 10. And finally, you can
find out about some tools specifically geared toward constructing printed cir-
cuit boards in Chapter 11.
Oh, the Hand Tools You Will Use
Hand tools are the mainstay of any toolbox. These tools tighten screws, snip
off wires, bend little pieces of metal, and do all those other mundane tasks.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

The following sections outline the basic hand tools that you need and what
you need them for.
Screwdrivers (the tool, not the cocktail)
Unless you were brought up in the woods by wolves, you know what a screw-
driver is. You use screwdrivers to put things together and take them apart
with screws. Screwdrivers come in all sorts of sizes. You use fairly small ones
for electronics. You may find a set of tiny, so-called “jeweler’s screwdrivers”
particularly handy for all the miniature stuff that you work with in electronics.
You can get screwdrivers just about anywhere, including hardware stores and
discount stores, such as Wal-Mart. Buy them in sets to save money.
Driving Miss Phillips
Screws come with different types of drive heads, such as Phillips heads with
their little (plus) + shape and slotted with a single score in the head (see
Figure 3-1). You need to use a screwdriver that matches your screw head.
Be sure to use the correct size of screwdriver for any drive style. This tip is
especially important when you use Phillips and specialty screws. Each drive
style comes in several different sizes, and using the wrong size screwdriver can
damage the head of the screw. So you may find it handy to buy an assortment
of screwdrivers — that way, you’re sure to have the right one when you need it.
44
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
Different screws for different jobs
Why the heck do screws have different types of
drive heads? No one really knows for sure, but
it may have to do with crop circles made by
alien visitors to Earth. No, just kidding! Each
drive type has its own advantages, depending
on the application. Here’s a quick rundown:
 Most screwdriver-using folks prefer slotted
screws for general use because they work
with a wider variety of blade sizes. (Even so,
only one blade size is absolutely correct for
any given screw head.)
 Phillips screws are easier to use in auto-
mated and semi-automated production. The
screwdriver naturally slips into the screw’s
slots and makes positive contact with the
screw head. This certainty makes Phillips-
head screws perfect for manufacturing
lines, and most of the electronics gadgets,
toys, and other products that you buy use
them.
 Hex and specialty screw heads provide a
positive, no-slip drive between screwdriver
and screw. You want to use these heads
when the screw has to be really tight, such
as with the assembly of a high-speed
machine or one that gets jostled a lot, like
your car.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

How many types of screws can there be, anyway? Here’s a list:
 Slotted screws: Probably the most common of all, these screws have a
single slot. Use with a flat-blade screwdriver.
 Phillips screws: These screws have a plus (+) shaped slot. Use with
a Phillips screwdriver. After slotted screws, you probably come across
Phillips screws most often.
 Hex screws: These screws have a hexagon-shaped socket. Use with a
hex screwdriver or a set of L-shaped hex wrenches. (You may hear these
tools also called Allen or key wrenches.) No matter what specific tool
you use, with a hex screw it must be the right size!
 Specialty screws: These screws use a variety of slot styles. Manufacturers
make many of these screws for specific projects or distributors, and you
don’t see them often. They go by names like Torx and Pozi-Drive. Don’t
bother buying specialty screwdrivers until you need them. Like hex
screws, you need to exactly match the specialty screw with the right
screwdriver.
Screwdrivers with a magnetic personality
When working with small screws, having a magnetized screwdriver really
helps. You can then use the screwdriver to pick up the screw and align the
screwdriver (with the screw magnetically stuck to the end) with the hole or
Figure 3-1:
Two screw
head styles.
45
Chapter 3: Outfitting Your Electronics Bench
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

slot — all with one hand and no cussing! If you don’t already have magnetized
screwdrivers, purchase a screwdriver magnetizer at the hardware store. The
magnetizer lets you magnetize and demagnetize your screwdrivers and other
metal tools.
Not all screws are metal. Some are made of nylon or another plastic material,
so obviously magnetizing your screwdrivers doesn’t help much with these
screws. Even some metal screws are non-magnetic, so your magnetic screw-
driver doesn’t have any supernatural powers over those little guys. These
non-magnetic metal screws are often made of brass, aluminum, or some type
of stainless steel.
Here’s a trick if you’re using non-magnetic screws and can’t seem to hold them
in position. Get a small package of rubber holdup putty, available at any office
supply store. Pull off a very small portion of the putty and cram it into the head
of the screw. Insert the screwdriver into the screw head. The screw should stay
attached to the screwdriver long enough for you to start screwing it into the
hole.
Take it off: Wire cutters and strippers
The wire cutter and stripper tool is a must-have for any electronics work. As
the name suggests, you use the wire cutter and stripper to both cut wire and
strip off the wire’s plastic insulation. You can see a combination cutter and
stripper in Figure 3-2. Look for these tools at Radio Shack and other electron-
ics parts stores, or check out one of the better-stocked hardware and home
improvement outlets.
With many strippers, you can “dial in” the gauge of the wire. (See the sidebar
titled “What the Heck Is Wire Gauge, Anyway?” if you want to know about
wire gauge.) This tool allows you to more easily remove just the insulation,
without cutting or nicking the wire underneath.
46
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
What the heck is wire gauge, anyway?
You measure wire thickness in gauge or AWG
(which stands for American Wire Gauge, if
you’re interested). The smaller the gauge, the
larger the wire. The smallest wire commonly
used in electronics is 30 gauge, for construct-
ing wire wrap circuit boards (see Chapter 12 for
more info on this technique). You should use
wire strippers especially made for this small
size.
Hookup wire for general electronics work is 20
to 22 gauge. You use this size for most projects.
For heavier-duty applications, like wiring up
large motors, you may use 16- or 18-gauge wire.
As a point of reference, 20-gauge wire mea-
sures 0.032 inches in diameter, whether it’s
made of one solid conductor or a twine of many
conductors twisted together. You read more
about wire and wire gauge in Chapter 5.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Some folks prefer to buy wire cutters and wire strippers as separate tools.
Either the cutter or stripper tends to get dull faster than the other (depend-
ing on the type of work that you do and the wire that you use). The separate
tools tend to be cheaper than one of the combo deals, and you don’t have to
pay as much down the road if you replace them one at a time.
Another form of wire cutter is the flush or nippy cutter, which you can see
in Figure 3-3. It cuts flush with a printed circuit board, and is useful when
you need to get in close. The tool works well with wire from 30 to 16 gauge.
Thicker wire may damage the tool or dull the cutting blades. For thicker
wires, use diagonal cutters, also called lineman’s pliers.
Getting a grip with needle-nosed pliers
Pliers help you grip stuff, bend wires, and hold parts in place during project
assembly. For intricate work, use a 5-inch, needle-nosed pair of pliers, such as
those that jewelry makers use. You can use larger pliers for general-purpose
work. (By the way, the size of the pliers reflects the overall dimensions of the
tool, not how large the jaws open.)
Figure 3-2:
A combina-
tion wire
cutter and
stripper.
47
Chapter 3: Outfitting Your Electronics Bench
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Be sure that you use the proper size pliers for the job. Using pliers that are
too small may ruin the tool. And using a tool that’s too large may damage
components or cause unnecessary frustration.
Magnifiers: The better to see you with
A 4X to 8X magnifying glass helps you zoom in close and inspect your handi-
work. You may find the magnifying glass particularly handy when you’re look-
ing for solder bridges, cold solder joints, or incomplete joints. (We cover
these soldering gotchas more fully in Chapter 8.)
4X or 8X means the magnifier enlarges the image by four or eight times,
respectively. You can get magnifiers with other magnification powers.
Anything less than 4X may not enlarge the image enough to be of any use to
you, and anything more than 8X may be too powerful to do the kind of detail
work that electronics requires.
Take a look at the magnifying glass in Figure 3-4. It’s attached to a set of
adjustable clips that hold small parts while you’re working. You can find this
type of rig, called “helping hands” or “third hand,” particularly useful when
you’re soldering or at any other time that you need to work with small parts.

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Another option for you to consider is magnifying glasses that you wear on
your head. Sounds painful, but it’s not. The unit slips over your head like a
baseball cap, with the magnifying glasses positioned in front of your eyes.
You can flip the magnifiers out of the way when you don’t need them.
A place for everything, and
everything in its place
Over the months and years that you play with electronics, you can amass
quite a few bits and pieces of junk. You want to keep track of it all, and you
can do this bit of organization easily using a parts bin, also affectionately
called a junk box. These bins have drawers for storing nuts, screws, resistors,
capacitors, and other little parts. Choose the bin that has the number and
size of drawers that you want. I like the type with both small and large draw-
ers; the large drawers accommodate the bigger parts, as well as some tools
and supplies, such as solder.
You may find that making labels to mark what’s in each drawer is really useful.
You can hand-write labels or use a labeler machine, such as the Brother 
P-Touch. For drawers that hold several different things, you can use dividers
that keep parts separated. Provide a separate label for each section. Don’t
write directly on the drawer with a marker or anything else that’s permanent.
You want the flexibility of being able to change what you keep in each drawer.

Filling out the toolbox
From time to time, you may need to use ordinary workshop tools when con-
structing an electronics project (for example, you probably need a saw or a
drill when you’re building a motorized ghost display for Halloween). But
don’t think that you have to rush out and buy one of every tool. Depending
on the type of projects that you build, you use some of these tools only occa-
sionally. Borrow what you don’t have. Just be sure to return them when
you’re done!
Here are some of the basics that you may want to get for yourself, or you can
always figure out which neighbor has these tools and go borrowing door to
door:
 Claw hammer: Used for just about anything you can think of that
involves banging things in and prying things up. An ordinary 16-ounce
claw hammer is all that you need.
 Rubber mallet: For gently bashing pieces together that typically resist
going together. Also use a mallet for forming sheet metal, in case you’re
building Robby the Robot or other metal project enclosures.
 Hacksaw: To cut anything. Get an assortment of blades. Coarse-tooth
blades cut wood and PVC pipe plastic well; fine-tooth blades work best
for cutting metal.
 Miter box: To make angled cuts with your hacksaw. A miter box includes
a three- or four-inch wide flat area where you place a board; two sides
with slots in them go up on either side of the flat area forming a U-shaped
channel. You put the board on the flat area, and place the saw through
the slots on the sides to keep it straight while cutting the wood at an
angle. Buy a good miter box and attach it to your worktable. Avoid
wooden miter boxes; they don’t last. An aluminum or plastic miter box
is better, and only slightly more expensive.
 Adjustable wrenches: Sometimes called Crescent wrenches (a popular
brand of wrenches), you may find these tools helpful additions to your
shop.
 Locking pliers: Such as Vice-Grips (that’s a brand name). The locking
mechanism helps hold pieces for cutting, sanding, drilling, or whatever
procedure that you need to do. See Figure 3-5 for an example of this tool. 
 Nut drivers: These tools make it easy for you to attach hex nuts to
machine screws. Get the assortment set because they’re cheaper that
way and you never know when you may need a particular size.
 Measuring tape: Get a cheap cloth tape at a fabric store. You don’t need
anything fancy or terribly long.

 File assortment: Use these files to smooth the rough edges of cut wood,
metal, and plastic. Purchase a set of miniature files at the hobby store.
They work just like the big-size files — they’re just smaller, and therefore
ideal for electronics.
 Drill motor: Get a reversible motorized drill with a variable speed con-
trol. You need to put the drill on a slow setting when working with metal
and plastic. For light-duty intricate work, you can use a hand-operated
drill. A drill motor with a 1⁄4-inch or 3⁄8-inch chuck works fine for the elec-
tronics shop. (The chuck is what holds the drill bit in place. The larger
the chuck, the larger the bits that can be used with the drill.)
 Drill bit assortment: You need drill bits for your drill motor. Be sure that
they’re sharp, and replace or sharpen them as needed. Buy an assort-
ment of bits; the assortment that ranges from 1⁄32 inch to 1⁄4 inch is most
suitable for electronics projects.
 Vise: Used for holding parts while you work. You don’t need to get elabo-
rate — a small vise that you clamp to the edge of your worktable gets
the job done.
 Clear safety goggles: Wear them when hammering, cutting, drilling, and
any other time when flying debris can get in your eyes. Be sure that you
use the goggles. Don’t just display them in your workshop.
Where to Park Your Tools
We talk about the basic tools that you need for electronics in the section “Oh,
the Hand Tools You’ll Use,” earlier in this chapter. Now comes the question of
where you put those tools so they’re out of the way when you don’t need

them but readily available when you do. If you have a permanent place in
your house to work on electronics, you can hang some of the tools on the
wall. Reserve this special treatment for the tools that you use the most —
wire cutters, pliers, and that sort of thing.
You can stash all the other tools in a small toolbox, which you can keep on
your workbench. You can purchase basic toolboxes for under $10. One low-
cost approach is to use a plastic fishing tackle box. (Plastic should work well
because tools for electronics don’t tend to be big or heavy.) A tackle box has
a lot of small compartments that you can use to store screws and little parts
you strip off of old projects, and the box includes a large section where you
can store your basic tools.
Tools You Don’t Absolutely Need
(But May Find Handy)
You can use a number of tools to make your time in the electronics shop
more productive and less time-consuming. These tools aren’t must-haves, but
if they’re already out in the garage, you’re sure to find a good use for them
every once in a while.
Getting ‘hole-istic’ with a drill press
This little gadget helps you drill better holes than you can drill using a hand-
held drill motor. Why? You have more control over the angle and depth of
each hole. Use a drill press vice to hold the pieces — never use your hands.
You find a drill press really handy when constructing your own printed cir-
cuit boards (see Chapter 11 for more about making printed circuit boards). If
you outfit yourself with a small #58 drill bit, you can quickly and efficiently
drill the component mounting holes in any circuit board.
You’re probably most familiar with fractional size drill bits: 3⁄32-inch, 1⁄8-inch,
1⁄4-inch, and so on. You refer to drill bits in between the standard fractional
sizes by a number value. A #58 drill bit, common in electronics because it’s
just the right size for making holes for component leads in printed circuit
boards, is a wee 0.042 inches in diameter. The closest common fractional
size is 1⁄16 inch (0.040 inch). In non-fractional terms, you call a 1⁄16-inch drill bit
a #60 drill bit.

Cutting things to size with a
table saw or circular saw
A table, or circular, saw is a handy item that makes cutting through large
pieces of wood and plastic easier. Use a guide fence, or fashion one out of
wood and clamps, to ensure a straight cut. Consult the user’s guide that came
with your saw if you’re unsure what a guide fence or any other part of your
saw is, or how to use it. Remember: safety first. 
Be sure to use a fine-tooth saw blade if you’re cutting through plastic. Using a
saw designed for general woodcutting can cause the plastic to shatter.
Getting intricate with a
motorized hobby tool
The motorized hobby tool, such as the model in Figure 3-6, may look like a
small drill motor, but it spins much, much faster: 25,000 revolutions per
minute and higher. (By comparison, most drill motors spin at under 2,500 rev-
olutions per minute.) The better hobby tools, such as those made by Dremel
and Weller, have adjustable speed controls.
Use the right bit for the job. For example, don’t use a wood rasp bit with metal
or plastic because the flutes of the rasp fill with metal and plastic debris too
easily. The instructions that come with the hobby tool help you match the bits
to the material that you’re dealing with and the work that you’re doing.

Keeping Things Clean and Well-Oiled
It’s a fact of life: Electronics don’t like dirt. Circuitry, components, and every-
thing you use in your electronics projects must be bright, shiny, and clean, or
things may not work right. You especially should start with a clean slate if
you’re soldering parts to a circuit board. Dirt makes for bad solder joints; bad
solder joints make for projects that either don’t work at all or work only
some of the time. Here are some products and techniques you can use to
keep your electronics clean and tidy.
Spic-and-span electronics
You may already have most of the cleaning supplies that you need for elec-
tronics, so you may just want to make a quick run around your house to be
sure that you’re stocked up. Here’s a checklist that you can use:
 Soft cloth: Keep your workshop and tools dust-free by using a soft cloth.
Avoid using household dusting sprays because some generate a static
charge that can damage electronics.
 Compressed air: You can remove dust from delicate electronic innards
with a shot of compressed air. You can buy compressed air in cans, such
as the one in Figure 3-7.

it’s great for

dust and dirt

electronics.

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Household cleaner: Lightly spray a household cleaner, such as Formula
409 or Fantastik, to remove stubborn dirt and grease from tools, work
surfaces, and the exterior surfaces of your projects. Because these
cleaners are water-based, don’t use them around powered circuits or
you may short something out.
 Electronics cleaner/degreaser: Use only a cleaner/degreaser made for
use on electronic components when applying directly on parts and cir-
cuit boards. You can find the cleaner in a spray can and a bottle with a
brush applicator.
Some electronics parts, especially motors, require a certain amount of grease
or oil to operate. Be careful not to clean off the grease or oil that these parts
need to function. If you must clean a part that requires lubrication, be sure to
add fresh oil or grease when you’re done.
Oil and grease to keep parts slippery
Electronics projects that use mechanical parts may require both initial lubri-
cation and periodic re-lubrication. Case in point: a walking robot. The leg
joints need a dab of oil now and then to keep things running smoothly.
Whether you use oil or grease depends on what you’re lubricating:
 For parts that spin, use a light machine oil, such as the kind you use for
sewing machines or musical instruments. Avoid using oil with anti-rust
ingredients because these ingredients may react to plastic parts and
cause them to melt.
 For parts that mesh or slide, use a synthetic grease, such as lithium
grease.
You can buy both light machine oil and synthetic grease at Radio Shack and
other electronics stores, as well as many music, sewing machine, hobby, and
hardware stores.
The Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz may have needed a honking big oilcan to
keep himself lubed up, but in most electronics projects, a little oil goes a long
way. A great alternative to oil in squeeze bottles or cans is the syringe oiler.
As its name suggests, the oil is packed in a small tube that looks like a med-
ical syringe. The “needle” is a thin, long spout, ideal for getting into hard-to-
reach places. You can buy this oil at many electronics stores, as well as at
some camera and music stores.
Some mechanical components don’t require oil or grease, and in fact, some
pieces can be harmed by lubricants. Certain self-lubricating plastics can
break down if you expose them to a petroleum-based lubricant. So, unless
you know for sure that a mechanical assembly or part needs oil or grease,
55
Chapter 3: Outfitting Your Electronics Bench
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

don’t automatically apply it. If you’re fixing some piece of electronic gear,
such as a VCR or CD player, check with the manufacturer for instructions
regarding use of lubrication.
Finally, although they’re convenient to use, spray-on synthetic lubricants
(such as WD-40 and LPS) don’t mix with electronics projects. There are two
main reasons to avoid spray-on lubricants:
 You may have trouble controlling the coverage of the spray. The spray
gets on a lot of parts that you don’t want it to reach, and it makes a big
mess.
 Many synthetic lubricants are non-conductive. The fine mist of the spray
can settle on goodies that should make electrical contact with one
another. If the lubricant interrupts that contact, your circuit doesn’t
work.
You should apply a lubricant directly and specifically to the part that needs it.
Yet more cleaning and 
construction supplies
You may find a variety of other cleaning, maintenance, and construction sup-
plies handy when you’re working on electronics. These supplies include
 Artist brushes: These brushes let you dust out pesky dirt. Don’t get any-
thing fancy, but avoid cheap brushes whose bristles fall out. Get both a
small brush and a wide brush so that you can tackle all kinds of jobs.
You can also use old toothbrushes (rinse and dry first, please).
 Photographic bulb brush: Combines the whisking action of a soft brush
with the cleaning action of a strong puff of air. Get these brushes at any
photo shop.
 Contact cleaner: Enables you to clean electrical contacts. The cleaner
comes in a spray can, but you can apply it by spraying the cleaner onto
a brush and then whisking the brush against the contacts.
 Cotton swabs: Help you soak up excess oil, lubricant, and cleaner. You
can find them in quantity at any drug store.
 Gauze bandage: The larger the sheet, the better. The gauze is clean (in
fact, sterile) and lint-free. You may find this material useful as a sterilized
cleaning cloth for electronic parts.
 Cuticle sticks and nail files: Break out that manicure set! These personal
grooming items let you scrape junk off circuit boards and electrical
contacts. 
56

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Pencil eraser: This bit of pink rubber goes a long way to rubbing electri-
cal contacts clean, especially contacts that have been contaminated by
the acid from a leaking battery. However, use care because rubbing the
eraser against the circuit board may create static electricity. Be sure to
use a pink eraser and not the white polymer kind. Non-pink erasers can
leave a residue that can be hard to remove.
 Modeling putty: The kind of putty that you use to assemble plastic
models can fill cracks and chips on the plastic exterior of your elec-
tronic projects.
Sticky Stuff to Keep Things Together
Many electronics projects require that you use adhesive of some type. For
example, you may need to secure a small printed circuit board to the inside of
a pocket-sized project box. A dab of glue or other adhesive does the job nicely.
Depending on the application, you can use ordinary household glue, epoxy,
cyanoacrylate glue (more commonly known as super glue), double-sided
foam tape, or a hot-melt glue gun. Here’s the rundown on the best uses for
each of these adhesives:
 White household glue is available in supermarkets, hardware stores, and
home improvement stores. Household glue comes in small bottles and
dries in 20 to 30 minutes (the glue takes about 12 hours to cure, how-
ever). White glue is best for projects that use wood or other porous
materials. If you’re using metal or plastic, opt for one of the other adhe-
sives listed here.
 Epoxy cement comes in two tubes. To use, you mix equal parts of the
tubes together and then apply the guck to the parts that you want stuck
together. Most epoxies set up in five to thirty minutes and cure com-
pletely in about 12 hours. Epoxy bonds are strong and resist moisture.
 Cyanoacrylate (CA) glue bonds almost anything, almost instantly. Use it
with caution because it can easily bond your fingers together. Use ordi-
nary CA glues when bonding smooth and perfectly matching parts; use
the heavier-bodied gap-filling CA glue if the parts don’t mate 100 percent.
 Double-sided foam tape is a quick-and-dirty method of attaching parts.
The tape works ideally in securing circuit boards to enclosures or
making sure that loosely fitting components remain in place. You can cut
the foam tape to almost any size that you need, and you can stack layers
if you need to fill a large gap. Be sure that you get the tape and the
mating surfaces dry and free of dirt before applying the tape.
 A hot-melt glue gun, such as the kind in Figure 3-8, is for the person who
doesn’t like to wait hours for glue to dry. Slip in a stick of glue, turn the
gun on, wait a minute for it to warm up, and you can glue things with a
57
Chapter 3: Outfitting Your Electronics Bench
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

drying time of only about 30 seconds. The glues are waterproof and gap-
sealing. You apply the glue at about 250 to 350 degrees — hot enough to
burn skin (so be careful!), but not hot enough to melt solder or damage
most electronic components.
Setting Up Your Electronics Lab
Where you put your workshop is just as important as the projects you make
and the tools you use. Just as in real estate, the guiding word for electronics
work is location, location, location. By staking out a comfortable spot in your
house or apartment, you’ll be better organized and enjoy your electronics
experiments much more. There’s nothing worse than working with a messy
workbench in dim lighting while breathing stale air.
The top ingredients for a great lab
The prime ingredients for the well-set-up electronics laboratory are
 A comfortable place to work, with a table and chair
 Good lighting

 Ample electrical outlets, with at least 15 amp service
 Tools and toolboxes on nearby shelves or racks
 A comfortable, dry climate
 A solid, flat work surface
 Peace and quiet
The ideal workspace won’t get disturbed if you have to leave it for hours or
days. Also, the worktable should be off-limits or inaccessible to young chil-
dren. Curious kids and electronics don’t mix!
So where in your house can you find an electronics haven, and how should
you set it up to work best for your projects? The following sections give you a
hand in figuring this stuff out.
Picking a perfect place 
to practice electronics
Before setting up shop, consider the best place in your house for building
your projects. The garage is an ideal setting because it gives you the freedom
to solder, hammer, and etch without having to worry about soiling the new
carpet. You don’t need much space; about 3 by 4 feet ought to do it. You can
set aside an area for your electronics in the garage and still park the car
(assuming that you don’t already have that space clogged with bikes, lawn-
mowers, old toys, and who knows what else). 
You can use a room in the house if you don’t have or can’t get into your
garage, but only if that room conforms to some basic requirements. When
working in a carpeted room, you may want to spread another material or
some protective cover over the floor to prevent static electricity — for exam-
ple, use an anti-static mat. You can read more about anti-static safety mea-
sures in Chapter 2.
Putting something down to cover the floor gives you a benefit besides reduc-
ing static electricity: When the floor cover fills with solder bits and little
pieces of wire and component leads, you can take the floor covering outside,
beat it with a broom, and put it back as good as new. (The cover is as good as
new; the broom may be a little the worse for wear.)
A bedroom, den, or family room can be an acceptable location for your elec-
tronics lab, but try to clear away a corner or section of the room for the dedi-
cated electronics hacking. Odds are, you need to leave projects overnight or
for even longer periods of time from time to time, and your work needs to
stay undisturbed.

If your work area is in a main area of the house, you may want (or need) to
hide it when you’re not experimenting. You can make quite a mess working
with electronics, especially if you’re in the middle of troubleshooting your
latest project. A folding screen works wonders to hide your work area, espe-
cially if you have your work surface situated in the corner of a room.
If your work area is exposed to other family members be sure to keep inter-
grated circuits and other sharp parts off the floor — they’re painful when
stepped on! Find ways to make the area off-limits to those with less knowledge
about electronics safety. Kids are naturally curious about electronic gizmos,
so if you have to, keep your projects, tools, and supplies out of reach on a
shelf, or behind lockable doors.
If you’re working in a bedroom or den, you may want to consider placing the
electronics bench in the closet. Close the closet doors, and no one knows
that you’re building that intergalactic spaceship with built-in espresso maker.
Triple threat: Heat, cold, and humidity
No matter where you set up shop, consider the climate. If you find a work
area chilly, warm, or damp, don’t use that area for electronics work. Extremes
in heat or cold and humidity not only make you uncomfortable; they can
have a profound effect on your electronics circuits, as well.
Use these climactic clues to guide you:
 If you’re working in a garage, attic, or basement, consider adding insula-
tion if the area doesn’t already have it. You can get rolls of fiberglass
insulation that are relatively cheap, and installing it requires little more
than a staple gun. But fiberglass can be dangerous if inhaled: Be sure to
follow the installation directions carefully. For fiberglass insulation, wear
gloves, eye protection, and a respirator while you’re installing it.
 Some basements and garages pose a problem because they contain too
much moisture. If your basement is at or below the water table level,
moisture may accumulate on the floor. For safety reasons, never work in
an area where the floor is wet or even slightly damp.
 When working in the garage, keep your electronics bench away from
doors and other openings. This step prevents moisture from the outside
from entering and ruining your projects. It also helps keep grass, bugs,
and dust out of your circuit boards. (In our garage, black widow spiders
like to make nests under the electronics bench. Yipes!!)

Workbench basics
You don’t need a large or elaborate workbench. The types of projects that you
do determine the size of the workbench, but for most applications, you need a
table measuring only about 2 by 3 feet. You probably already have a small
desk, table, or drafting table that you can use for your electronics bench.
Here are some other ideas for your workbench:
 Use a door as a table surface. Build legs using 30-inch lengths of 2-by-4
lumber and attach the legs using joist hangars. (You can buy all this stuff
at any home improvement store.) You can get hollow-core doors for less
money, but the solid-core doors last longer and don’t bow with age and
weight. As an alternative, you can build your work surface using 3⁄4-inch
plywood or particle board.
 If you prefer, forget the 2-by-4 legs and make a simple table surface using
a door and two sawhorses. The advantage of this get-up is that you can
take apart and store your workbench in the corner when you’re not
using it.
 Many electronics technicians prefer to cover their work surface with a
layer of carpeting. The carpeting acts as a cushion to protect circuit
boards, cabinets, and other components. If you use a piece of carpet, get
a new, clean remnant and cut it to size. The shorter the nap, the better
(so that you don’t constantly lose little parts in the shag). If you can, get
a carpet that has been treated with an anti-static spray or, better yet,
contains anti-static metallic threads.
Remember, as you work on projects, you crouch over the worktable for hours
at a time. You can skimp and buy or build an inexpensive worktable, but if
you don’t already own a good chair, put one on the top of your shopping list.
Be sure to adjust the seat for the height of the worktable. A poor-fitting chair
can cause backaches and fatigue.

lectronics folks refer to the assortment of odds-and-ends that go into
a circuit, collectively, as components. These are the things that make a
circuit work. Although you can make a complete circuit with just a battery,
some wire, and a light bulb, most electronics projects use a few more compo-
nents, such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and integrated cir-
cuits. You can think of these components as the common building blocks of
the typical electronics gizmo.
The variety of components, and the way they connect to one another, deter-
mines what a circuit does. Wired one way, a collection of a few resistors,
capacitors, and transistors can build an electronic siren; wired another way,
the circuit can become a flashing crossing sign for a model railroad.
In this chapter, you can read about the most common electronic components
used in circuits: what they are, what you can use them for, and what they do.
And because part of becoming an electronics pro includes being able to iden-
tify components just by the way they look, you discover how to do that in
this chapter, as well.

Viva la Resistors
Electric current is simply the motion of electrons from one place to another
through a wire. The more electrons that are flowing, the higher the current.
Resistors have an apt name: They “resist” the electrical current going through
them. You can think of resistors as “brakes” for electrons. By controlling the
electrons going through a resistor, you can make a circuit do different things.
Resistors may be the primary building block of circuits, so you see them
quite a bit in electronics projects. Here are some of the things you can use
them for:
 Limiting current to another component: Some parts, such as light emit-
ting diodes (LEDs), eat up current. Like a kid eats candy bars they try to
gobble up as much as you give them. But LEDs run into a problem —
they burn themselves out if they eat too much current. You can use a
resistor to limit the amount of current that reaches an LED.
 Reducing voltage to part of the circuit: In many circuits, you need to
provide different voltages to different parts of the circuit. You can do
this easily with resistors. Two resistors joined, as Figure 4-1 shows you,
form what’s called a voltage divider. Assuming that you have two identi-
cal resistors, that is, they apply their brakes in the same amount, the
voltage in between the two is exactly half that of the rest of the circuit.
 Controlling the voltage/current going into another component:
Combine a resistor and a capacitor, for example, and you create a kind
of hourglass timer. Or put a resistor at the input of a transistor to control
how much the transistor amplifies a signal. Or . . . well, you get the idea.

 Protecting the inputs of sensitive components: Too much current
destroys electronic components. By putting a resistor at the input of a
sensitive transistor or integrated circuit, you limit the current that
reaches that transistor or circuit. Although not foolproof, this simple
technique can save you a lot of time and money that you would lose
fixing accidental blow-ups of your circuits.
Ohming in on resistor values
If resistors act like brakes, then you have to have some way to change how
hard you push the pedal, in order to have control over the flow of electrons.
That control involves modifying the resistance of a resistor.
Electronics dabblers know the amount of resistance in a resistor as the ohm,
typically represented by the Greek capitalized letter omega: Ω. The higher
the ohm value, the more resistance the component provides.
To understand how you can adjust resistance, you should know that there
are two basic types of resistors, fixed and variable. Here’s how they differ:
 A fixed resistor supplies a pre-determined resistance to current. Color
coding identifies the value of most fixed resistors. The color coding starts
near the edge of the resistor and is comprised of four, five, and some-
times six bands of different colors. Figure 4-2 shows the order of bands
marked on the body of the resistor along with what each represents.
 A variable resistor, called a potentiometer, allows for the continual
adjustment from virtually no ohms to some maximum value. The poten-
tiometer usually has the maximum value printed on it somewhere. See
the section “Dialing with potentiometers,” later in this chapter, for
detailed info on these puppies.

Not all resistors use color coding. Sometimes, the exact value may be printed
on the resistor. This is typical of so-called precision resistors: The actual resis-
tance of the component is very close to or exactly what you see printed on
them. You can read more about the precision of resistors in the following 
section.
Color me red, green, and blue
As we noted in the previous section, the vast majority of resistors use color
coding to tell you what resistance, in ohms, they provide. The color code
is a world-wide standard, and we’ve been using it in electronics for many
decades. Although the colors are standardized, a resistor can have either
four or five bands of color, depending on whether it’s standard-precision or
high-precision.
Standard-precision resistors use four color bands. These resistors come
within at least 2 percent of their marked value. That is, the markings on the
resistor and the actual value of the resistor when you test it fall within at
least 2 percent of one another. You use standard-precision resistors for
99 percent of your hobby projects. High-precision resistors have five color
bands, and they come within 1 percent or less of their marked value. You
can find out more about high-precision resistors in the section “A word (or
two) about high-precision resistors,” later in this chapter.
Here’s what the bands on a standard-precision resistor represent:
 Bands one, two, and three indicate the value of the resistor.
 Band four indicates the tolerance of the resistor and typically falls
within +5 percent or +10 percent of the resistor’s actual tolerance (a
range of resistance value; read more about this in the following section).
Table 4-1 shows the meaning of the color codes used on the bands so that
you can determine the value of the resistor. Assume that the resistor has
yellow-violet-red-silver markings. The first two bands indicate the first two
digits of the value of the resistor. Referring to Table 4-1, yellow represents
4 and violet stands for 7, so the significant digits of a resistor with a yellow-
violet-red-silver band scheme are 47. The third band indicates the multiplier,
in this example that band is red, so the value is 100. Multiply 47 by 100, and
you get 4700 ohms. You express values over 1000 in K (for kilo, or 1000), so
you say that the resistor has a value of 4.7K ohm. Note that in this table cer-
tain colors will never be used for certain bands, hence no value is noted.

Understanding resistor tolerance
The last band of the resistor indicates its tolerance. Tolerance takes into
account unavoidable variations in resistor manufacturing. Though a resistor
may have a 2,000 ohms marking, for example, its actual value may be slightly
higher or lower. You refer to the potential variation in value as tolerance,
expressed as a percentage (for example, +5-percent tolerance means the resis-
tor value may vary plus or minus 5 percent from the stated value). In most
cases, being a little off doesn’t significantly affect the operation of the circuit.
Knowing the tolerance of the resistor lets you decide if a resistor is adequate
for a particular circuit. Tolerance appears in the last column of Table 4-1.
Take a look at the yellow-violet-red-silver resistor example from the previous
section. By looking at Table 4-1, you can see that silver, the last band, denotes
+10-percent tolerance. This value means that the resistor can vary in toler-
ance 10 percent higher or lower than its indicated value. If the resistor has an
indicated value of 4.7K with a 10 percent tolerance, the actual value can fall
anywhere between 4,230 and 5,170 ohms.

Most circuits tell you the safe resistor tolerance to use, either for all the resis-
tors in the circuit or for each resistor. Look for a notation in the parts list or
as a footnote at the bottom of the circuit diagram. If the schematic doesn’t
state a tolerance, then you can assume that you may safely use standard +5
percent or +10 percent tolerance resistors.
If you aren’t sure of the resistance of a particular resistor, you can use a mul-
timeter to check it, as we describe in Chapter 9.
Let there be heat
Whenever electrons flow through something, they generate heat. The more
electrons, the higher the heat. Resistors also come rated by their power.
Power is measured in watts — the higher the watts, the higher the heat.
Electronic components can only stand so much heat (how much depends on
the size and type of component) before they sizzle into a charred mass. The
power rating tells you how many watts can safely go through the resistor.
You calculate watts by using this formula:
P = I x V
P stands for power, measured in watts; I represents the current, in amps,
going through the resistor; and V represents the voltage as measured across
the resistor. For example, suppose that the voltage is 5 volts, and 25 mil-
liamps of current go through the resistor. To calculate watts, multiply 5 by
0.025. You get 0.125, or 1⁄8 watt.
Unlike the value in ohms, the component seldom has the resistor wattage
printed on it, either written out or as part of the color code. Instead, you
have to figure out the wattage by the size of resistor, or, if you know where
you bought the resistor, check with the manufacturer. Resistors that you use

A word (or two) about high-precision resistors
Many high-precision resistors use a five-band
color coding system (on those that don’t, the
actual value of the resistor is printed on its body).
These resistors have a tighter tolerance than
standard-precision resistors. You use high-pre-
cision resistors in a circuit where you need to
have a resistor of a very specific value. For
example, a resistor used in a timing or voltage
reference circuit may need such a precise value.
In a high-precision resistor, here’s what the
bands represent:
 Bands one through four indicate the value
of the resistor.
 The fifth band indicates the tolerance of the
resistor, typically +1 percent.

in high-load applications, such as motor or lamp control, require higher
wattages than those resistors that you use in low-current applications. The
majority of resistors that you use for hobby electronics are rated at 1⁄4 or even
1⁄8 watt.
High-wattage resistors take many forms, some of which you can see in Figure
4-3. Resistors over five watts commonly come encased in epoxy or other
waterproof and flameproof coating and have a rectangular, rather than cylin-
drical, shape. Higher-wattage resistors may even include their own metal
heat sink where the fins help draw heat away from the resistor.
Dialing with potentiometers
Variable resistors, more commonly known as potentiometers (or in electron-
ics slang as pots), let you “dial in” a resistance. The upward value of the
potentiometer determines the actual range of resistance. Most potentiometers
are marked with this upward value — 10K, 50K, 100K, 1M, and so forth. For
example, with a 50K potentiometer, you can dial in any resistance from 0 to
50,000 ohms. Bear in mind that the range on the potentiometer is approximate
only. If the potentiometer lacks markings, you need to use a multimeter to
figure out the component’s value. (You can read about how to test resistances,
using a multimeter, in Chapter 9.)

Virtually all potentiometers are the dial type. You sometimes use the other
type, the slide potentiometer, on gadgets like stereo equipment. The dial kind
is typically easier to mount into your own projects.
With the dial type of potentiometer, you can rotate the dial nearly 360
degrees, depending on the specific qualities of the potentiometer that you’re
using. At one extreme, the potentiometer has zero resistance going through
it; at the other extreme, the resistance is the maximum value of the compo-
nent. Your television volume control or electric blanket control are typical
examples of the dial pot.
Capacitors: Reservoirs for Electricity
After resistors, capacitors are the second most common component in the
average electronic device. Capacitors are interesting little gadgets. They
store electrons by attracting them to a positive voltage. When the voltage is
reduced or removed, the electrons move off. When a capacitor removes or
adds electrons to the circuit in this fashion, it can work to smooth out volt-
age fluctuations. In some cases you can use capacitors combined with resis-
tors as timers (read more about this in Chapter 7). Capacitors make possible
all kinds of circuits, such as amplifiers and thousands of others.
Capacitors are used for all sorts of neat applications, including
 Creating timers: A kind of electronic metronome, a timer most often
pairs up with a resistor to control the speed of the tick-tick-tick.
 Smoothing out voltage: Power supplies that convert AC current to DC
often use capacitors to help smooth out the voltage so that the voltage
stays at a nice, constant level.
 Blocking DC current: When connected inline (in series) with a signal
source, such as a microphone, capacitors block DC current but pass AC
current. Most kinds of amplifiers use this function, for example.
 Adjusting frequency: You use capacitors to make simple filters that
reject AC signals above or below some desired frequency. By adjusting
the value of the capacitor, it’s possible for you to change the cut-off
frequencies of the filter.
A quick look inside a capacitor
Though they many sound complicated because of all the things that you can
use them for, capacitors are really very simple devices. The typical capacitor
has two metal plates inside it. The plates don’t touch. Instead, a dielectric
material, which is a fancy term for an insulator, separates the plates.
70
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Common dielectrics used in capacitors include plastic, mica, and paper. (We
talk more about the dielectric in the section “Dielectric this, dielectric that,”
later in this chapter.)
Farads big and small
You probably realize by now that, just as politicians have an excuse for every-
thing, electronics types have units of measure for absolutely everything. The
electronics world rates capacitors by capacitance, expressed in farads. The
higher the value, the more electrons the capacitor can store at any one time.
The farad is a rather large unit of measurement, so the bulk of capacitors
available today come rated in microfarads, or a millionth of a farad. You may
even come across an even smaller rating — the picofarad, or a millionth of a
millionth of a microfarad. Using the Greek “micro” character, electronics doc-
umentation most often shortens the microfarad to µF, as in 10µF. You shorten
the picofarad to the simple pF.
Here are some examples:
 A 10-µF capacitor is 10 millionths of a farad.
 A 1-µF capacitor is 1 millionth of a farad.
 A 100-pF capacitor is 100 million of a millionth of a microfarad.
Keeping an eye on the working voltage
The working voltage, sometimes abbreviated simply as WV, is the highest volt-
age that a capacitor can withstand before the dielectric layers in the compo-
nent become damaged. At higher voltages, the current may simply arc between
the plates, like a lightning strike during a storm. If a capacitor isn’t designed to
withstand high voltages, a spark develops within the capacitor that punches
through the dielectric material, leaving the component useless (shorted out).
The typical capacitor designed for DC circuits rates at no more than 16 to 35
volts. You don’t need higher voltages because anywhere between 3.3 and 12
volts typically powers these circuits. Only when you build circuits that use
higher voltages do you need to concern yourself with the working voltage of
capacitors. It’s a good idea to select a capacitor with a working voltage of at
least 10-15 percent more than the voltage in the circuit for safety.
Dielectric this, dielectric that
Suppose your teen asks you to make her a banana split. The problem: You
don’t have any bananas. So you improvise and use cucumbers instead. Blecch!

It’s just not the same. It’s not the cuke’s fault, it’s how you used the hapless
vegetable that spelled culinary disaster. Similarly, designers of electronic cir-
cuitry specify capacitors for projects by the dielectric material in them. Some
materials are better in certain applications: Just like bananas in a banana split,
they provide a better match.
The most common dielectric materials are aluminum electrolytic, tantalum
electrolytic, ceramic, mica, polypropylene, polyester (or Mylar®), paper, and
polystyrene. If a circuit diagram calls for a capacitor of a certain type, you
should be sure to get one that matches.

Big capacitor in itty-bitty living space
Making farad-range capacitors has become
possible only recently. Using older construction
techniques, a one-farad capacitor would be
bigger than a bread box and kind of unwieldy.
By using other technologies and materials, such
as microscopically-small carbon granules,
manufacturers can now build capacitors of one
farad and above that fit into the palm of your
hand. Computer memories, clock radios, and
other electric devices that need to retain a small
charge for extended periods of time when they
have no access to power routinely use capaci-
tors as substitute batteries.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Capacitors come in a variety of shapes, as you can see in Figure 4-4. Aluminum
electrolytic and paper capacitors commonly come in a cylindrical shape.
Tantalum electrolytic, ceramic, mica, and polystyrene capacitors have a more
bulbous shape because they typically get dipped into an epoxy or plastic bath
to form their outside skin. However, not all capacitors of any particular type
(such as mica or Mylar®) get manufactured the same way, so you can’t always
tell the component book by its cover.
How much capacity does
my capacitor have?
Some capacitors have their value in farads or portions of a farad printed
directly on them. You usually find this to be the case with larger aluminum
electrolytic types; the large size of the capacitor provides ample room to
print the capacitance and working voltage.
Most smaller capacitors, such as 0.1- or 0.01-µF mica disc capacitors, use a
three-digit marking system to indicate capacitance and tolerance. Most folks
find the numbering system easy to use. But there’s a catch! (There’s always a

catch.) The system is based on picofarads, not microfarads. A number using
this marking system, such as 103, means 10 followed by three zeros, as in
10,000 or 10,000 picofarads.
Any value over 1,000 picofarads most often comes in microfarads. To make
the conversion from picofarads to microfarads, just move the decimal point
to the left six spaces. So, the result of the example above (with its 10,000 pF)
is 0.01 µF.
You can use Table 4-3 as a handy reference guide to common capacitor mark-
ings that use this numbering system. Notice that two-digit values are in pico-
farads. So, for instance, a capacitor with “22” printed on it has a value of 22
picofarads. Three digit numbers are microfarads.

Another, less-often-used numbering system uses both numbers and letters,
like this:
4R1
The placement of the letter R tells you the position of the decimal point: 4R1
is really 4.1. This numbering system doesn’t indicate the units of measure,
however, which can be in microfarads or picofarads.
You can test capacitance with a capacitor meter or a multimeter with a capaci-
tance input. Most meters require that you plug the capacitor directly into the
test instrument, as the capacitance can increase with longer leads. This makes
the reading less accurate. Chapter 9 talks about testing capacitors.
When a microfarad isn’t 
quite a microfarad
Most capacitors are rather inexact beasts. The value printed on the capaci-
tor, and the actual capacitance of the capacitor, may not be the same. In fact,
they may not even come close. Manufacturing variations cause this problem;
capacitor makers aren’t just out to confuse you. Fortunately, the inexactness
is seldom an issue in homebrewed circuits. Still, you need to know about
these variations so that, if a circuit calls for a higher precision capacitor, you
know what to buy.
Like resistors, capacitors are rated by their tolerance, and this tolerance
comes as a percentage. On many capacitors, a single letter code indicates the
tolerance. You may find that letter placed by itself on the body of the capaci-
tor or placed after the three digit mark, such as
103Z
The letter Z denotes a tolerance of +80 percent to -20 percent. This tolerance
means that the capacitor, rated at 0.01 µF, may have an actual value as much
as 80 percent higher or 20 percent lower than the stated value. Table 4-4 lists
the meanings of common code letters used to indicate capacitor tolerance.

Tolerating hot and cold
Here’s a little tolerance gotcha: The value of a capacitor changes with tem-
perature, which you call its temperature coefficient. When the markings on a
capacitor mention temperature coefficient at all, the value is indicated as a
three-character code, such as NP0, meaning negative/positive zero. A capaci-
tor with the NP0 designation is fairly tolerant of temperature changes.
More and more capacitor manufacturers are adopting what they call the EIA
marking system for temperature tolerance, which you can check out in Table
4-5. The three characters in each mark indicate the temperature tolerance
and maximum variation within the stated temperature range.
For example, using Table 4-5, you can figure out that a capacitor marked Y5P
has the following characteristics:
 -30+C low temperature requirement
 +85+C high temperature requirement
 +10.0 percent variance in capacitance within the -30+C to +85+C range

Being positive about capacitor polarity
One final mark that you find on some capacitors, especially tantalum and alu-
minum electrolytic types, is a polarity symbol. By convention, most capaci-
tors use the minus (–) sign for the negative terminal and don’t use the plus
(+) sign for the positive terminal. For example, as the top capacitor in Figure
4-5 shows, the minus sign and arrow point to the negative lead of the alu-
minum electrolytic capacitor.
Note that only larger-value capacitors (1 µF and up), typically just the elec-
trolytic types, are polarized. (You can still find non-polarized electrolytic
capacitors out there, too. They’re commonly used in stereo speaker sys-
tems.) The smaller capacitors, such as mica, ceramic, and Mylar®, are not
polarized, so they don’t have a polarity mark.
If a capacitor is polarized, you really, really need to make sure to install it in
the circuit with the proper orientation. If you reverse the leads to the capaci-
tor, by connecting the + side to the ground rail, for example, you may ruin the
capacitor. You may also damage other components in the circuit, or the
capacitor could even explode.

Changing capacitance
It’s always a good thing when you get things just the way you want them.
That’s why it’s so nice that variable capacitors allow you to adjust capaci-
tance to suit your needs. 
The most common type of variable capacitor that you encounter is the air
dielectric type, such as the one you find in the tuning control of an AM radio.
Smaller-variable capacitors are often used in radio receivers and transmit-
ters, and they work in circuits that use quartz crystals to provide an accurate
reference signal. The value of such variable capacitors typically falls in the
5 to 500 pF range.
Diode Mania
The diode is the simplest form of semiconductor. You use semiconductors in
a circuit to control the flow of electrons (Chapter 1 tells you more about
semiconductors). A diode has two terminals, each with a high resistance to

current in one direction and low resistance to current in the opposite direc-
tion. Or put another way, diodes act as a one-way valve for electrons.
Electrons can go through the diode in one direction but not in the other.
A variety of applications use diodes, and these diodes fall into numerous sub-
types. Here is a list of the most common diodes:
 Zener: These puppies limit voltage to a pre-determined amount. You can
build a voltage regulator for your circuit cheaply and easily with a zener
diode.
 Light-emitting diode (LED): All semiconductors emit infrared light when
they conduct current. LEDs emit visible light. Now available in all the
colors of the rainbow.
 Silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR): The SCR is a type of switch used to
control AC or DC currents. They’re common in light dimmer switches.
 Rectifier: This basic diode transforms (referred to as “rectifying”) AC
current to provide DC current only. (Remember: AC current alternates
between both positive and negative values. DC current does not alter-
nate, and is only positive or negative. See Figure 4-6 for an example.)
Diodes are often referred to as rectifiers because they perform this
rectifying function.
 Bridge rectifier: This component consists of four diodes, connected one
to the other to form a kind of box shape; it rectifies AC to DC with maxi-
mum efficiency.
You can see a sampling of diodes in Figure 4-7.

Important ratings for diodes:
Peak voltage and current
Except for zeners, diodes don’t have “values” like resistors and capacitors.
A diode simply does its thing in controlling the flow of electrons. But that
doesn’t mean all diodes are the same. Diodes are rated by two main criteria:
peak inverse voltage (PIV) and current. These criteria specify the kind of
diode that you should use in a given circuit.
 The PIV rating roughly indicates the maximum working voltage for the
diode. For example, if the diode is rated at 100 volts, you shouldn’t use it
in a circuit that applies more than 100 volts to the diode.
 The current rating is the maximum amount of current the diode can
withstand. Assuming a diode is rated for 3 amps, it can’t safely conduct
more than 3 amps without overheating and failing.
Diodes are identified by an industry-standard numerical system. A classic
example is the 1N4001 rectifier diode, which is rated at 1.0 PIV and 50 volts. A
1N4002 is rated at 100 volts, a 1N4003 is rated at 200 volts, and so on. We
promise not to bore you with what all the numbers represent and how they
correspond to PIV and current: You can readily find this information in any
diode data cross-reference book or electronics component catalog.
Want to become a diode spotter? Rectifier diodes rated to about 3 to 5 amps
generally come encased in black or gray epoxy, and they’re designed so that
you can directly mount them on printed circuit boards. Higher-current
diodes, such as 20, 30, or 40 amps, commonly come contained inside a metal

housing. The metal housing includes a heat sink or a mounting stud so that
you can affix the diode securely on a heat sink. A few diodes use the same
packaging as transistors (which we describe in the next section).
Which way is up?
All diodes have what amounts to positive and negative terminals. The termi-
nals go by special names: The positive terminal is called the anode, and the
negative terminal is called the cathode. You can readily identify the cathode
end of a diode by looking for a red or black stripe near one of the leads.
Figure 4-8 shows a diode with a stripe at the cathode end. This stripe corre-
sponds with the line in the schematic symbol for the diode. It’s important
that when you follow a schematic to build a circuit you orient the diode with
the line facing the specified way.
As we talk about in the section “Diode Mania,” earlier in this chapter, diodes
pass current going in one direction and block current going in the other. So, if
you insert a diode backward in a circuit, either the circuit doesn’t work at all
or you damage some components. Always note the orientation of the diode
when you use it in a circuit. Double-check to make sure that you have it right!
Fun, fun, fun with light-emitting diodes
If bright lights turn you on, you can appreciate the curious behavior of semi-
conductors: They emit light when you apply an electric current to them. This
light is generally very dim and only in the infrared region of the electromag-
netic spectrum. The light-emitting diode (LED), such as the light that glows
yellow or green when your computer is on, is a special type of semiconductor
expressly designed to emit copious amounts of light. Most LEDs are engineered
to produce red, yellow, or green visible light, but some special-purpose types
emit infrared, blue, and even white light.

LEDs carry the same specifications as any other diode, but they usually have
a pretty low current rating. An LED has a PIV rating of about 100 to 150 volts,
with a maximum current rating of under 50 milliamps. If more current passes
through an LED than its maximum rating allows, the LED burns up like a
marshmallow in a campfire.
LED specifications indicate both the maximum current rating, usually referred
to as forward current, and the peak current. The peak current is the absolute
maximum current that you can pass through the LED for a very short period
of time. Here, short means short — on the order of milliseconds. Don’t con-
fuse forward current with peak current, or you may wreck your LED.
Resistors, meet LEDs
You use a resistor, such as the one in Figure 4-9, to limit the current to the
LED. You select the value of the resistor to maintain the current below the
maximum current rating of the LED. The calculation is simple, and for most
LEDs and 5 or 12 volt circuits, you can use common resistor values that get
you in the right ballpark.
We list common resistor values in Table 4-6; the values are selected based on
the ratings of most LEDs.

You can always select a higher value resistor, which simply makes the LED
glow less brightly. If you select a lower value resistor, you run the risk of
burning out the LED. Because most LEDs cost just a few pennies a piece, you
can experiment with resistors of different values and not break the bank.
Make it a game to see how bright you can make your LED before you make it
go up in smoke — just kidding!
If you want a more accurate calculation, you need to know the forward volt-
age drop through the LED, in addition to the LED’s maximum current rating.
Most standard brightness LEDs have a forward voltage drop of about 1.5
volts. The latest crop of ultra-bright LEDs may have forward voltage drops
exceeding 3.5 volts.
The calculation for desired forward current, in egghead terms, is this:
R = (Vs - Vf) / If
 R stands for the value of the resistor, in ohms, that you want to use.
 Vs represents the supply voltage. It’s measured in volts.
 Vf is the forward voltage drop through the LED. This is also measured in
volts
 If stands for the forward current (in amps) that you want  to pass through
the LED. You can use the maximum current rating of the LED or some-
thing less for the forward current, but never use more!
Suppose a circuit is powered at 6 VDC and the forward voltage drop through
the LED is 1.2 volts. You want a forward current of 40 mA (that’s 0.040 of an
amp). Substituting these values in the calculation, you get:
R = (6 - 1.2) / 0.040
Do the math in your head, on paper, or with a calculator, and you see that R
equals 120 (ohms). So, to pass 40 mA of current through this particular LED
when using a 6-volt supply, you use a 120-ohm resistor. Remember to do the
calculation again if you change the voltage of the power supply or use an LED
with a higher or lower forward voltage drop.
The Transistor: A Modern Marvel
Imagine the world without the simple transistor. Radios would all be the size
of a toaster oven. Cell phones would be the size of a washing machine. And
today’s super fast computers would be the size of . . . Rhode Island.

Transistors were developed as an alternative to the vacuum tube. The two
main ways that you can use transistors (or vacuum tubes, for that matter)
are to amplify a signal or to switch a signal on and off. Besides its small size, a
transistor has another advantage — it uses less power than a vacuum tube to
accomplish the same job.
With creative connections in a circuit, you can also use transistors to switch
or amplify voltages. This fancy circuit work can confuse you when you’re
studying circuits involving transistors. Transistors are very complex little
critters, so we just talk about the basic types you encounter when you begin
working in the electronics world, what they look like, and other getting-to-
know-you details in this book.
Millions of individual transistors make up the microprocessor at the heart of
your home computer. Without transistors, we would live in a world with no
PCs. (Hmmm...late at night, slaving away on my computer, I think maybe tran-
sistors aren’t such a great idea after all...)
Slogging through transistor ratings
Resistors, capacitors, and even diodes have fairly simple and straightforward
ratings. But the transistor just has to be difficult. These doohickeys are rated
by a number of criteria far too extensive for this book to tackle. Here are just
a very few of them:
 Collector-to-base voltage
 Collector-to-emitter voltage
 Maximum collector current
 Maximum device dissipation
 Maximum operating frequency

I am not a number, I’m a free transistor!
At last count, you can find several thousand dif-
ferent transistors currently available from more
than two dozen manufacturers. How can you
tell them apart? A unique number code, such as
2N2222 or MPS6519, identifies each kind of tran-
sistor. If you’re rebuilding a circuit that you see
in a book or on a Web page, use the transistor
number code to find a match.
If you can’t find an exact match, you can proba-
bly use a close substitute. Transistor manufac-
turers provide substitution guides that help you
find which one of their parts closely matches the
transistor that you’re looking for. NTE, a major
reseller of replacement transistors, provides a
popular transistor substitution guide. Visit their
Web site at www.nteinc.com for an online
cross-reference substitution guide.

None of these ratings appears anywhere on the transistor — that would be
too easy. To determine these characteristics, you have to look up the transis-
tor in a specifications book, or consult the technical documentation at the
manufacturer’s Web site. For basic electronics tinkering, you don’t need to
know — or even understand — what these specifications mean. More than
likely, you simply use the transistor that your project specifies.
Figure 4-10 shows a grab bag of different kinds of transistors.
On the case of transistor cases
The semiconductor material in a transistor is the size of a grain of sand or
even smaller. It’s kind of hard to solder wires to something so teensy, so they
put semiconductor material in a metal or plastic case. You can find literally
dozens and dozens of sizes and styles of transistor cases, and this book defi-
nitely can’t describe them all. But to help you identify the most common
types, here’s what you should look for:
 Plastic or metal: Signal transistors come in either plastic or metal cases.
The plastic variety works for most uses, but some precision applications
need the metal variety because transistors that use metal cases (or
cans) are less susceptible to stray radio frequency interference. Signal
transistors almost always have three lead connections (sometimes
four). If the transistor has just two wires, it’s probably the light-depen-
dent type, which we talk about in Chapter 5.
 Size matters: Power transistors come in both plastic and metal cases,
and they’re physically larger than signal transistors.

Making connections
Transistors typically have three wire leads. The leads in the typical three-lead
transistor are
 Base
 Emitter
 Collector
A base is wired to a voltage or current and turns the transistor on or off.
Emitter and collectors leads connect to a positive or negative voltage source
or ground. Which lead goes where varies with the circuit.
You can see this arrangement of connections in Figure 4-11. A few transistors,
most notably the field-effect transistor (or FET), include a fourth lead. This
lead grounds the case to the chassis of the circuit.
You absolutely, positively have to make sure that you don’t install a transis-
tor the wrong way in your circuit. Switching the connections around can
damage the transistor and sometimes other components. You can find your-
self even more confused by transistor connections because they’re often
(though not always!) shown from the underside of the case because that’s

where you solder them on. That is, the lead pinouts look as if you’ve turned
the transistor over and are looking at it from the bottom. This perspective
makes soldering the transistor in a circuit board easier.
Transistor types
First, transistors qualify as either NPN or PNP devices. These mysterious
abbreviations refer to the sandwiching, or junctions, of the semiconductor
materials inside the device. Unless you have x-ray vision, you can’t tell the
difference between an NPN and PNP transistor just by looking at them.
However, the catalog specification sheets, as well as schematics, should tell
you the difference, as in Figure 4-12. You select NPN and PNP devices based
on how you plan to use the transistor in the circuit. We can’t get into the
nitty-gritty of choosing an NPN or PNP transistor here because it could fill a
whole book. But we can say that you can’t mix-and-match NPN and PNP tran-
sistors. If a circuit calls for a PNP transistor, you can’t substitute an NPN type
without expecting to see smoke billowing out of some part of your device.
As if you didn’t have enough stuff to memorize, in addition to the junction
type, transistors are categorized by how the junction is created during manu-
facturing. The two main types of transistors that you’re likely to encounter
are bipolar and FET. Here’s how they differ:
 Bipolar transistors: These transistors are the most common kind (and
they’re the kind that we cover in the preceding sections). A small input
current is applied to the base of the transistor. This in turn, changes the
amount of current that flows between the collector and emitter.

 FETs (field effect transistors): These transistors also have three connec-
tions, but you call those connections gate, source, and drain, rather than
base, collector, and emitter. Applying a voltage to the gate controls the
current between the source and drain. FETs come in two types: N-chan-
nel (similar to NPN) and P-channel (similar to PNP).
Technically, FETs come in two sub types: MOSFET and JFET. For the purposes
of your basic electronics education, the differences between these two types
don’t really matter, but knowing this kind of secret electronics language helps
you sound smarter when you talk to your electronics geek friends.
Static discharge can damage FET transistors. At the very least, always store
your FETs in anti-static foam. When buying FETs, keep them in their anti-
static bag or tube and leave them there until you’re ready to use ‘em.
Packing Parts Together
on Integrated Circuits
All the components that we mention in the earlier sections of this chapter
come just one to a package. Electronics mavens call them discrete compo-
nents, meaning separate. (Don’t confuse the word with discreet which means
minding your own business.)
Enter the integrated circuit, the true marvel of the 20th century. Also called a
chip or IC, these amazing creations are miniature circuit boards produced on
a single piece of semiconductor. A typical integrated circuit contains hun-
dreds of transistors, resistors, diodes, and capacitors. Because of this circuit
efficiency, you can build really complex circuits with just a couple of parts.
ICs are the building blocks of larger circuits. You string them together to form
just about any electronic device you can think up.
The way that all the components are wired inside an IC determines what the
IC does. You can either solder the IC directly into the circuit board or mount
it in a socket.
Integrated circuits most often come enclosed in dual in-line pin (DIP) pack-
ages, such as the ones in Figure 4-13. This illustration shows several sizes of
DIP ICs, from 8-pin to 40-pin. The most common sizes are 8-, 14-, and 16-pin.
Linear, digital, or combination plate?
Over the years, chip makers have come out with thousands upon thousands of
different ICs. Each one does something special. Many of the integrated circuits
you encounter are standardized, and you can read various books to discover
88
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

more about them. A lot of chip makers offer these standardized ICs, and 
manufacturers and electronics hobbyists the world over buy and use them
in various projects. Other ICs, called special-purpose ICs, are designed to
accomplish some unique task. More often than not, only a single company
sells a particular special-purpose chip.
Whether standardized or special-purpose, you can separate ICs into two main
categories: linear and digital. These terms relate to the kinds of electrical sig-
nals that work within the circuit:
 Linear ICs: These ICs are designed to work with any circuit that uses
varying voltages and currents (an analog circuit). An example of an
analog circuit is a guitar amplifier.
 Digital ICs: These ICs are designed to work with a circuit that uses just
two voltages (a digital circuit). As we note in Chapter 1, these two volt-
ages indicate binary digital data (on/off, high/low, 0/1, that sort of thing).
Common voltages that represent digital data are 0 and (often) 5 volts.
Refer to Chapter 4 for more detail about digital circuits and binary data.
The majority of standardized ICs fall into either the linear or digital category.
Most mail order outfits that sell ICs separate them into linear and digital lists.
Some ICs are made to work with both analog (linear) and digital signals, and
some can convert between digital and analog signals or work with a host of
other combinations. There’s no sense in trying to corral all of the variations
in this book, except to note that you can’t neatly classify all chips as either
linear or digital.

IC part numbers
ICs — like transistors, — have a unique number code to identify them. This
code, such as 7400 or 4017, indicates the type of device. You can look up
specifications and parameters about an IC in a reference book or online. The
code is printed on the back of the IC.
Many ICs also contain other information, including manufacturer catalog
number and maybe even a code that represents when the chip was made.
Don’t confuse the date code or catalog number with the code that the catalog
uses to identify the device. Manufacturers don’t have any standards for how
they stamp the date code on their integrated circuits, so you may have to do
some detective work to pick out the actual part number of the IC.
Understanding IC pinouts
By their nature, integrated circuits require multiple connections to a circuit.
These connections are called pins. One pin may be for power, another for
ground, another for input, yet another for output, and so forth. The function
of each pin is referred to as pinout. The pinout isn’t printed on the top of the
integrated circuit. In order to use the IC in a project you have to look up the
pinout in the data sheet for the integrated circuit. You can find these data
sheets for most common (and many uncommon) ICs on the Internet. Use a
Google or Yahoo! search to help you locate them.
In order to identify what each pin is for, by convention, the pins on an IC are
numbered counterclockwise, starting with the upper-left pin closest to the
clocking mark. The clocking mark is usually a notch, but it can also be a little
dimple, or white or colored stripe. The pins are numbered looking down from
the top of the IC, starting from 1. So, for example, the pins of a 14-pin IC are
numbered 1 through 7 down the left side and 8 through 14 up the right side,
as you can see in Figure 4-14.
Schematic diagrams show the connections to integrated circuits in one of
two ways:
 Some schematic diagrams show an outline of the IC with numbers
beside each pin. The numbers correspond to the clocked pinout of the
device. (Remember, start with 1 in the upper left and go counterclock-
wise.) You can easily wire up an IC with these kinds of diagrams because
you don’t need to look up the device in a book or data sheet. Just make
sure that you follow the schematic and that you count the pins properly.
 If the schematic lacks pin numbers, you need to find a copy of the pinout
diagram. For standard ICs, you can find these diagrams in reference
books and online; for non-standard ICs, you have to visit the manufac-
turer’s Web site to get the data sheet.
90

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You can always make a reference copy of the pinout, even if the schematic
includes the pin numbers. With this copy, you can double-check your work
(and the schematic) to help ensure accuracy. The schematic may have num-
bered the pins incorrectly, and you can save yourself a lot of trouble and frus-
tration by checking the schematic against the pinout diagram.

lthough the resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors that we dis-
cuss in Chapter 4 are pretty darn important (you’d have trouble finding
a circuit in the world that you can build without them), you need to know
about some other parts that you make use of in your electronics career.
Some of these other parts, such as wires, connectors, and batteries are pretty
essential. After all, you’d be hard put to build an electrical circuit without
wires to connect things together or a source of power to make things run.
You use some other parts that we discuss in this chapter only now and then
for certain circuits; for example, you don’t want to use one of those annoying
buzzers on every circuit that you build, but when you want to make noise,
they come in handy.
In this chapter, we discuss a mixed bag of parts, some of which you need to
stock up on right away, and others you can leave until you need them.
Making the Connection
Making a circuit requires that you connect components to allow electric cur-
rent to flow between them. The following sections describe wires, cables, and
connectors that allow you to do just that.

Wire
Wire that you use in electronics projects is just a long strand of metal, usually
made of copper. The wire has only one job — to allow electrons to travel
through it. However, you can find a few variations in the types of wire avail-
able to you. In the following sections, we talk about which type of wire you
use for different situations.
Stranded or solid wire?
Cut open the cord of any old household lamp (make sure that you’re ready to
junk it and unplug it first!!), and you see two or three small bundles of very
fine wires, each wrapped in insulation. This is called stranded wire. If, on the
other hand, you have only one wire on its own, instead of a bundle of wires,
you call it solid wire. You can see examples of stranded and solid wires in
Figure 5-1.
When do you use each type of wire? It’s not as complicated as you may think:
You use stranded wire in projects where the wire will be moved around. For
example, you use stranded wires for multimeter leads because you move and
flex the leads frequently. If you use a solid wire, it snaps in two after you flex
it several times.
Use solid wire to connect components on breadboards (check out Chapter 11
for more on breadboards) and other places where you don’t plan to move the
wire around. You can easily insert the solid wire into holes in the board, and

that wire stays in the shape to which you mold it. If you try to use a stranded
wire in a breadboard, you have to twist the strands to get all of them in the
hole, and you may break a strand which could short out the circuit.
Size matters
You refer to the size of wire as wire gauge. The wire gauge is simply short-
hand for the diameter of the wire. What’s confusing is that the relationship
between wire gauge and wire diameter is essentially backwards. A smaller
wire gauge means a larger wire diameter.
Manufacturers saddled us with this backwards-naming scheme because of
the manufacturing process they use for wires. To make a wire, the metal
(usually copper) is pulled through a hole in a steel plate. To make a small
diameter wire, the wire is pulled through a series of holes, each hole smaller
than the previous one. The wire gauge refers to the number of different size
holes the wire was pulled through to make the desired diameter. So the
higher the number, the more times someone had to pull the wire and the
smaller that wire got in the process. You can see common wire gauges in
Table 5-1.

Here are a few gauge guidelines for you:
 You can use 20- or 22-gauge wire for most electronics projects.
 You may find 16- or 18-gauge wire useful for heavy-duty applications,
such as connecting motors to a power supply.
 You use 30-gauge wire for wire wrapping, a method for connecting com-
ponents on circuit boards, as we discuss in Chapter 12.
The wire gauges listed here work for the types of projects that we cover in
Chapters 14 and 15. You use smaller gauge (and therefore larger diameter)
wires for many other types of heavy-duty applications. For example, if you
have an electric range in your kitchen, it typically uses 6-gauge wire (which
has a diameter of 0.162 inches) to supply electric current to the range.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Note that you sometimes see gauge abbreviated in weird and wonderful
ways. For example, you may see 6 gauge abbreviated as 6 ga., #6, or 6 AWG
(AWG stands for American Wire Gauge).
If you start working on projects in which you use higher voltage or currents
than the ones we describe in this book, consult the instructions for your
project or an authoritative reference to determine the correct wire gauge.
For example, the National Electrical Code lists the appropriate wire gauges for
each type of wiring that you use in a house. Make sure that you also have the
right skills and sufficient knowledge of safety procedures to work on such a
project.
The colorful world of wires
Whoever said that electronics isn’t a colorful subject didn’t know a thing
about wire. The insulation around wire comes in different colors to help you
identify what you should attach the wire to.
Look at the connector for a 9-volt battery, for example. You see one red and
one black wire. The red wire attaches to the positive terminal of the battery,
and the black wire attaches to the negative terminal.
When wiring up a circuit (for example, when you work with a breadboard),
you use certain color wires for each type of connection. This distinction
allows you (if you don’t have a photographic memory) or someone else to
look at the circuit and identify each type of connection.
Here are the different colors and their suggested uses:
 Use red wire for all connections to +V (positive voltage).
 Use black wire for all connections to –V (negative voltage) or ground. If
you’re connecting the wire to ground, you can also use green wire.
 Use yellow or orange wire for input signals, such as the signal from a
microphone. If you have more than one input signal, use a separate
color for each.
Collecting wires into cables or cords
Cables are actually groups of two or more wires protected by an outer layer of
insulation, such as the power cord mentioned earlier in the section “Stranded
or solid?”. Cables differ from stranded wires because the wires used in a cable
are separated by layers of insulation. Cables are less fragile than individual
wires, so you can string them between pieces of equipment — for example,
you can use cables to connect a TV to a DVD player. You can see a cable with
plug-in connectors in Figure 5-2.
96

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Making connections with connectors
If you take a look at a typical cable, say the one that goes from your computer
to your printer, you see that it has metal or plastic doodads on each end. There
are also metal or plastic receptacles on your computer and printer that these
cable ends fit into. You call all of these metal or plastic parts connectors. You
insert one connector on the cable, called a plug, into a matching connector (in
this case, a socket or jack) on the printer. The various pins and holes connect
the appropriate wire in the cable to the corresponding wire in the device.
Here are the connectors that you run into most often in your electronics
adventures:
 A terminal and terminal block work together as the simplest type of con-
nector. A terminal block contains sets of screws in pairs. You attach the
block to the case or chassis of your project. You then solder (or crimp)
a wire to a terminal for each wire that you want to connect. Next, you
connect each terminal to a screw on the block. To connect wires to each
other, simply pick a pair of screws and connect the terminal on each wire
to one of those screws. For many of the early projects that you tackle,
you don’t need anything more complex than this type of connector.
Figure 5-2:

connectors.
97
Chapter 5: Filling Out Your Parts Bin
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 A useful terminal-block variation mounts the terminal block on a printed
circuit board. This type of terminal block allows you to simply insert
the bare end of a wire into a contact in the block, instead of soldering a
terminal to the wire.
 Plugs and jacks that carry audio signals between equipment, as from a
guitar to an amplifier, have cables such as the one you see in Figure 5-2.
There are plugs on both ends of the cable and a jack is mounted on both
the guitar and amplifier. These cables contain either one or two signal
wires; a metal shield surrounds the wires. This metal shield minimizes
the introduction of current into the wires, limiting noise that can disrupt
a signal.
 You typically use pin headers to bring signals to and from circuit boards
(we talk more about circuit boards in Chapter 12). You mount the socket
half of this kind of connector on the circuit board, and you attach the plug
half to a ribbon cable. The rectangular shape of the connector allows for
easy routing of signals from each wire in the cable to the correct part of
the circuit board. You refer to these connectors by the number of pins —
for example, you may talk about a 40-pin header. After you start building
robots or other more complex projects that involve more than one circuit
board, you can find a use for this type of connector.
Electronics uses many connectors that you don’t need to know about until
you get into more complex projects. When you build that spaceship, or any
other more complicated gadget, you can look up details on the connectors
that you need on many electronic suppliers’ Web sites or in catalogs.
Powering Up
All the wires and connectors in the world won’t do you much good if you don’t
have a power source. After you build a project, you need voltage and current
to get the thing going. You can get power from your wall outlet (we talk about
plugging into your wall outlet in Chapter 3), batteries, or solar cells.
For electronics projects, batteries and solar cells make great power sources
because they’re lightweight and portable. The following sections discuss how
to choose batteries and solar cells for your projects.
Turning the juice on with batteries
A battery uses a process called an electrochemical reaction to produce a pos-
itive voltage at one terminal and a negative voltage at the other terminal. This
process involves placing two different types of metal in a certain type of
98

chemical. (Because you didn’t buy Chemistry For Dummies — by John T.
Moore from Wiley Publishing, by the way — we don’t get into the guts of a
battery here, just the basics.)
You can categorize batteries by size, voltage, and the type of chemicals that
they contain, such as zinc-carbon or nickel-cadmium. Figure 5-3 shows a few
typical battery sizes.
Starting with your everyday-type batteries
Start with the standard, non-rechargeable type of batteries that you can buy
in any supermarket. The AAA-, AA-, C-, and D-size batteries all produce about
1.5 volts, compared to the transistor battery (that little rectangular battery
that looks sort of like a Lego® block found in lots of small electronic gadgets)
that produces about 9 volts and the lantern battery (that big boxy thing that
fits in flashlights the size of a boom box) that produces about 6 volts.
You can combine any number of 1.5-volt batteries to get the voltage that you
need for your project. For example, when you connect the positive terminal of
one battery to the negative terminal of another battery (you call this set-up
connecting the batteries in series), as in Figure 5-4, you get twice the voltage.

You put batteries together in battery holders. When you place four 1.5-volt
batteries in a battery holder, for example, those batteries combine to pro-
duce 6 volts; when you place six 1.5-volt batteries in a battery holder, they
combine to produce 9 volts; and so on. Figure 5-5 shows a battery holder con-

For many projects that require a 9-volt supply, you actually do better using a
battery holder with six smaller voltage AA batteries than a single 9-volt battery.
Why? The AA batteries last longer than the single 9-volt battery. The amount of
electric current that a battery can generate before it depletes the chemicals it
contains varies. A battery holder with six AA batteries cumulatively contains
more chemicals than a single 9-volt battery, and so the battery holder lasts
longer. (This example assumes that both batteries use the same chemicals,
which we discuss later, in the section “Sorting batteries by what’s inside”).
When you use a battery it begins to wear out and the voltage drops; for exam-
ple we checked a 9-volt battery that we’d used for a few days and found that it
was only producing 7-volts.
Batteries that just keep on going
If you have a project that uses a lot of current, or you plan to run the gadget
all the time, it can eat through non-rechargeable AA batteries like you go
through popcorn at a movie theater. In that case, you can use
 C or D size batteries: These batteries are bigger than AA batteries;
remember, the bigger the battery, the longer it lasts.
 Rechargeable batteries: Some batteries allow you to revitalize the chemi-
cals that they use, bringing them back to something like their original
charge. See the next section for more about rechargeable batteries.
Though some (fool) hardy souls do recharge non-rechargeable batteries, it’s
not a good idea. The batteries can rupture and leak acid, or worse (think
exploding batteries — not a pretty picture).
Sorting batteries by what’s inside
Batteries are classified by the chemicals they contain. Note that any of the
various size batteries that we discuss in the previous sections can contain
these chemicals, and the chemicals in a battery relate to whether that bat-
tery is rechargeable or non-rechargeable.
101
Chapter 5: Filling Out Your Parts Bin
Taking AA batteries to the max
The amp-hour or milliamp-hour rating for a bat-
tery gives you a measure of how much current
a battery can conduct for a given length of time.
For example, a 9-volt transistor battery usually
has about a 500 milliamp-hour rating (this mea-
surement varies with the battery type; see the
section “Sorting batteries by what’s inside” for
more about battery types). Such a battery can
power a circuit using 25 milliamps for approxi-
mately 20 hours before its voltage begins to
drop. An AA battery may have a 1500 milliamp-
hour rating. Therefore, a battery pack contain-
ing AA batteries can power a circuit using 25
milliamps for approximately 60 hours.

If you buy rechargeable batteries make sure that the battery charger you use
is designed for that type of rechargeable battery. 
Some of the readily available battery types use the following chemicals:
 Zinc-carbon: This type of battery falls at the low quality end of non-
rechargeable batteries. Although they don’t cost very much, you have
to replace them frequently.
 Alkaline: We suggest that you start with this type of battery for your
projects. These batteries last about three times as long as zinc-carbon
batteries. When you find yourself doing so many projects that you need
to replace these batteries frequently, step up to rechargeable batteries.
 Nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cad or NiCad): This is the most popular type of
rechargeable battery. Though many manufacturers have eliminated the
problem today, the big flaw with some nickel-cadmium batteries is some-
thing called the memory effect. With the memory effect, you need to fully
discharge the battery before recharging it to insure that it recharges to full
capacity. If you don’t discharge it, it doesn’t charge fully. Nickel-cadmium
batteries generate about 1.2 volts.
 Nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH): This type of rechargeable battery gener-
ates about 1.2 volts. This battery doesn’t suffer from the memory effect
seen in nickel-cadmium batteries. If you decide to use rechargeable
batteries, we suggest that you start with these. Buying a recharger and
a supply of these batteries saves you a considerable amount of money
over time.
 Lithium: If you’re working on a project that requires a lightweight battery,
consider lithium. This type of battery generates higher voltage than other
types, at about 3 volts. Lithium also has a higher capacity than alkaline
batteries. They cost more, and you can’t recharge most batteries of this
type. But for a project where you need to watch your weight (no, we don’t
mean dieting), such as when moving a small robot around the house, you
may find them very useful.
Don’t worry about whether to use lithium-polymer or lithium-ion batteries.
Some battery experts speculate that the manufacturing process for lithium-
polymer batteries may evolve to produce a better battery in the future.
However, at this point in time, you can’t really make a strong case for them
having any advantages over the lithium-ion type. So just go with the battery
that you can find most easily, or the one that costs less.
Turning on power with solar cells
In Chapter 4, we discuss light-emitting diodes that generate light when you
apply an electric current to them. Conversely, if you shine light on diodes,
102
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

they generate an electric current. A solar cell is just a large diode that gener-
ates current when exposed to a light source, such as the sun.
To power a project, you can buy panels of solar cells. You have to weigh the
voltage and current requirements for your project against the size of the
solar panel. For example, a panel measuring about 5 x 5 inches may be able
to generate 100 milliamps at 5 volts in bright sunlight. If you need 10 amps,
you can get it, but you may find the size of the panel problematic on a smaller
or more portable project.
Look at the following criteria before choosing a solar panel for your project:
 Do you plan to have the solar panel in sunlight when you want the
gadget to be on?
If not, look for another power source. Or, if you want to get fancy, design
the gadget so that the solar cell provides a charge to the batteries to
power the gadget even when it’s dark.
 Is a solar panel that provides enough power small enough to fit on your
gadget?
If not, redesign the gadget to take less power or look for another power
source.
Turning Electricity On and Off
You’ve scrounged around your growing electronics bin and come up with
wires to connect a circuit together and batteries to power the circuit. So how
do you turn the power on and off? You use switches and relays, which we
cover in the following sections.
Turning current on and off with switches
When you move the switch to shut off your flashlight, you disconnect the
wires that run from the battery to the light bulb. All switches do the same
thing: Connect wires to allow electric current to flow or disconnect wires to
stop electric current from flowing.
When you turn off your flashlight, you put the switch in what is called the
open position. With the switch in the open position, you have a disconnected
wire, and no current can flow. When you turn on the flashlight, you put the
switch in the closed position. With the switch in the closed position, you’ve
connected the wire (and completed the circuit), and current can flow.
103
Chapter 5: Filling Out Your Parts Bin

Starting with simple switches
Your flashlight usually comes with something called a slide switch. With a
slide switch, you slide the switch forward or backward to turn the light on or
off. You can see some other types of switches (toggle, rocker, and leaf
switches) in Figure 5-6.
Toggle, rocker, and slide switches all do the same job, so grab whatever
switch you have handy that you can easily use on the project that you’re
building. For example, a slide switch works well on a round, handheld flash-
light because of the position of your thumb, but a toggle switch may work
best to flip on a gadget sitting on your workbench. 
Want to see a leaf switch in action? In chapter 15 we describe how you can
use a leaf switch like a car bumper that tells a robot when it’s bumped into
something. Push-button switches come in three versions:
 Normally closed (NC): This push-button switch disconnects the wire
only when you push the button.
 Normally open (NO): This push-button switch connects the wire only
when you push the button.
 Push on/Push off buttons: This switch connects the wire with one push
and disconnects the wire with the next.

You typically find push-button switches in electronics to start or stop a circuit.
For example, you press a normally open push-button switch to ring a doorbell. 
What’s inside a switch?
You call the basic switches that we talk about in the previous section single-
pole single-throw, or SPST types. Don’t worry about all the different names:
In essence, these switch types have one wire coming into the switch and one
wire leaving it. 
Just to keep your electronics life interesting, you may come across other
types of switches that are wired a bit differently, called double pole. Where
single pole switches have one input wire, double pole switches have two input
wires. With single throw switches you can connect or disconnect each input
wire to one output wire, while double throw switches allow you to choose
which of two output wires you connect each input wire to.
There are a few single- and double-pole variations, including
 Single-pole double-throw (SPDT): In this switch, one wire comes into
the switch and two wires leave the switch. When you want to choose
what device a circuit turns on (for example, a green light to let people
know that they can enter a room or a red light to tell them to stay out),
use an SPDT switch.
 Double-pole single-throw (DPST): This switch has two wires coming into
it and two wires leaving. You can use a DPST switch to control two sepa-
rate circuits. For example, you can have one circuit with components
running on 5 volts and another circuit with components running on 12
volts. With one switch, you can turn both circuits on or off.
 Double-pole double-throw (DPDT): This switch has two wires coming into
it and four wires leaving. A DPDT switch has three positions. In the first
position, the first pair of output wires connect. In the second position,
all four output wires disconnect (some DPDT switches do not have this
position). In the third position, the second pair of output wires connect.
You can use this type of switch to reverse the polarity of DC voltage going
into a motor so that the motor turns in the opposite direction. (One posi-
tion makes the motor turn clockwise, one position turns off power to the
motor, and one position turns the motor counterclockwise.)
Let a relay flip the switch
You’ve made a gadget to let you know when your no-good brother-in-law,
Herman, is raiding the refrigerator. But there’s one problem: The gadget runs
on a 5-volt battery pack, and you want the gadget to turn on enough sound
and light to scare the guy into the next county. No problem, just use a relay.

How relays work
A relay is simply an electrically powered switch. When your gadget sends 5
volts to the relay, an electromagnet turns on and then closes a switch inside
the relay. If you wire that switch to 117 volts, you can power enough lights
and sirens to send Herman scurrying.
Exploring electromagnets
So how does the electromagnet part of a relay setup work? An electromagnet
can be something as simple as coiled wire around an iron bar or even a nail.
When you run some current through the wire, the bar becomes magnetized.
When you shut off the current, the bar loses that magnetic quality.
Two magnets attract or repel each other, depending on which ends (or poles)
of the magnets you put together. Part of the switch contained in a relay con-
sists of a lever attached to a magnet, as you can see in Figure 5-7. When voltage
runs through the wire coil, the electromagnet pulls the lever toward it, and the
switch closes, connecting the 115 volts to the lights and sirens (goodbye,
Herman!). When you shut off current to the wire coil the electromagnet shuts
off and a spring pulls the lever away, opening the switch.
You can find relays that use 5, 12, or 24 VDC to power an electromagnet with
a SPST, SPDT, or DPDT switch (see “What’s inside a switch,” earlier, for more
info about switch types). 
Often, instead of saying that a switch in the relay opens or closes, people talk
about contacts opening or closing. Also, people sometimes call a lever in a
relay an armature. But a relay by any other name, would work the same...
Making Decisions with Logic Gates

the game takes a little simple logic. When a knight threatens your rook, there

are only so many moves that you can make. You have to go through the pos-
sible moves in your mind to decide which one can save your rook.
So if your opponent is a computer, how the heck did the machine learn to be
logical?
Skipping the complicated programming and electronic circuits involved in a
computer chess game, just what enables programming and circuits to imple-
ment logic? That trick involves something called logic gates. Logic gates are
integrated circuits that take input values and determine what output value to
use based on a set of rules. Usually, logic gates have two inputs; one type of
logic gate, called an inverter, has only one input. You can even get logic gates
with more than two inputs, which you may need for some projects.
See Tables 5-2 through 5-6 in the section “Common logic gates,” later in this
chapter, for information about how output varies depending on input.
Using logic in electronics
Although you may not build the next generation of computer chess games,
you can use logic gates for simpler things. For example, the microprocessor
in the calculator you use to balance your checkbook uses logic gates to add,
subtract, multiply, and divide. On the level of electronics projects that you’re
likely to tackle at first, you can build a simple circuit with some logic gates to
count how many times the door to your house opens, monitoring your
family’s comings and goings.
When people talk about logic gate input and output values, they say that an
input is high (1) or low (0 – zero). In a typical circuit, high means the circuit
has a voltage of approximately 5 volts because that is the voltage typically
used to turn on a transistor. Low means it has the voltage of approximately
zero volts. 
Common logic gates
You may encounter any of these five common logic gates: AND, OR, Inverter
(or NOT), NAND (basically an AND gate followed by an inverter), and NOR
(basically an OR gate followed by an inverter). Tables 5-2 through 5-6 show
you the output for each of these gates with various combinations of inputs.
The name of each logic gate comes from how the inputs determine the
output. For example the output of the AND gate is high only when both inputs
(one input AND the other input) are high, but the output of the OR gate is
high when either one OR the other, OR both of the inputs is high. We show
you the symbols used for each type of gate in Chapter 6.

You usually find multiple logic gates sold in integrated circuits, such as an IC
containing four two-input AND gates (called a quad 2-input AND gate). Look
on the Web site of your IC’s manufacturer for a data sheet that tells you
which pins are inputs, outputs, V+ (voltage), and ground. This information
allows you to make choices, such as whether to use one or all four of the
logic gates in the integrated circuit.
Make sure that the part you buy has the number of inputs that you need for
your project. Remember that you can buy logic gates with more than two
inputs. For example, you can find a 3-input AND gate from most electronics
suppliers.
Some components already have gates wired together in a circuit to perform
functions, such as counting or decoding. When you work with circuits that
require such functions, look at the manufacturer’s datasheet to determine
how the part works and to understand the nature of each pin.
Controlling Frequency with
Inductors and Crystals
Inductors and crystals both have a relationship with frequency. Inductors are
used to weed out all but a desired frequency (this is one of the pieces of the
process when a radio tunes into only one station; more about this shortly).
Crystals, on the other hand, are often used to generate specific frequencies in
a circuit. 
Storing energy in inductors
Anybody who has driven across country and experienced the annoyance of
tuning into and then losing a radio station every ten minutes knows that
radio stations come and go. But exactly what goes on inside your average
radio to bring you those tunes (however fleeting)?
109
Chapter 5: Filling Out Your Parts Bin
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Every radio station broadcasts electric waves at a particular frequency. When
you change radio stations, you’re actually tuning your radio into a new fre-
quency by changing variable components in the circuit so that the radio
allows only signals at that frequency through.
So what exactly weeds out all signals but your favorite Top 20 station?
Circuits use inductors (you may hear inductors also called “coils” or
“chokes”) along with capacitors (which we discuss in Chapter 4) to filter out
all but one frequency.
You also find inductors in many other types of circuits. For example, more
elaborate power supplies use inductors as a means of reducing the 60-Hz
“noise” that often occurs on an incoming power line.
Inductance is the ability of a wire coil to store energy in the magnetic field
that surrounds it when current is flowing through the wire. You state the
value of an inductor in henrys (H or h), or more commonly, millihenrys
(thousandths of a henry) and microhenrys (millionth of a henry). The value
of an inductor measures its ability to reduce the voltage of an AC signal. The
value of inductors is typically marked using the same color-coding technique
used for resistors, which you can read about in Chapter 4. You can often find
the value of larger inductors printed directly on the components. Smaller
value inductors look a lot like low-wattage resistors, and these inductors and
resistors even have similar color-coding marks. Larger value inductors come
in a variety of sizes and shapes depending upon their application. 
Inductors can be either fixed or variable. With both types, a slender wire
winds around an insulating core. The number of turns of the wire, the core
material, and the wire’s diameter determine the value of the inductor. Fixed
inductors have a constant value, while variable inductors sport a knob you
can turn to adjust the value.
The core of an inductor can be made of air, iron ferrite, or any number of
other materials (though inductors use air and ferrite most often). 
110
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
An inductor by any other name
You sometimes hear inductors called by other
names, including choke and coil. You can use
these names interchangeably, but they don’t
always have the same meaning to circuit
designers. For example, designers most often
use a coil to resonate at a certain frequency,
and they use a choke to reject a group or range
of frequencies. We use the word inductor
throughout this book to encompass all the little
sub-varieties.

Making frequencies crystal clear
When you cut a quartz crystal to a certain thickness, that crystal resonates
at a particular frequency. You use crystals in circuits called oscillators to gen-
erate electric signals at a certain frequency. Microcontrollers, such as the
BASIC Stamp controller (we talk about this device in Chapter 13), use oscilla-
tors. Many other types of electronic gadgets make use of oscillators, too.
You state the frequency for a crystal in MHz (Megahertz, a measurement that
you can read more about in Chapter 1). Crystals have two leads to connect
them to a circuit, and you can buy them in a variety of shapes.
This may seem obvious, but when you buy a crystal, be sure to get one with
the operating frequency appropriate for your project.
Making Sense of Things
You use some components to trigger a circuit to do something (such as turn-
ing on a light) when those components sense that some event has happened
(such as a change in temperature). Handily enough, these are called sensors.
The following sections cover a few sensors that you may come across in your
electronics projects.
Can you see the light?
There’s one variation among several of the standard components that you
can read about in Chapter 4: Light dependency. Manufacturers make certain
versions of resistors, diodes, and transistors sensitive to light. The output of
these components varies as the amount of light shining on them changes.
You can use light-dependent components as sensors in equipment such as
burglar alarms, safety devices that work with your descending electric
garage-door to stop it when a cat runs underneath, and automatic dusk-to-
dawn lighting. You can also use them for communication. If you use a remote
control for your TV (and who doesn’t?), your TV contains a light-sensitive
transistor or diode to receive signals from that remote control.
Here is the lowdown on how resistors and transistors fit into the light sensor
equation:
 You can refer to light-dependent resistors as photocells or photo resis-
tors; their resistance changes based on the amount of light falling on
them. The typical photocell is most sensitive to visible light, especially
in the greenish-yellow spectrum.
111
Chapter 5: Filling Out Your Parts Bin
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 You can refer to light-dependent transistors and diodes as phototransis-
tors and photodiodes, respectively. From the outside, phototransistors
and photodiodes look identical to each other, so make sure to keep them
in separate cubbies in your parts bins. Both are sensitive mostly to
infrared light (essentially this is heat) which you cannot see. When you
use a remote control for your TV you are using a photodiode in the
remote to send infrared signals to a phototransistor in your TV.
We give you only the basics about components that work by light in this
chapter. Take a look at Chapter 14 for some nifty hands-on projects using sev-
eral types of light-dependent components.
Sensing the action with motion detectors
When you walk up to someone’s front door and the light turns on, you’ve
found a motion detector at work. Many homes, schools, and stores use
motion detectors to turn on lights or detect burglars.
Most motion detectors use a technique called passive infrared (PIR) and use
or control 117-volt circuits. Typically, these models mount on a wall or on top
of a floodlight, and they take up a lot of room.
For a project using a battery pack, you probably need a compact motion
detector that works with about 5 volts. You can find this kind of motion
detector through online security system vendors.
Getting inside a motion detector’s head
The insides of a PIR motion detector actually are fairly simple. PIR motion
detectors contain two crystals, a lens, and a small electronic circuit. When
infrared light (basically, heat which you or any other warm thing generates)
hits the crystal, it generates an electric charge. A person gives off heat, as do
other living things, so you set off a motion detector when you come near it.
A typical motion detector has three wires: ground, positive supply voltage, and
the output for the sensor. If you supply +5 volts to the PIR, the voltage on the
output wire reads about 0 (zero) volts when the PIR detects no motion. When it
does detect motion, the voltage on the output wire reads about 5 volts.
Don’t buy a PIR sensor rather than a motion detector. A sensor doesn’t have
the lens that comes with a motion detector. It’s that lens that helps the
sensor to detect the motion of something rather than just the presence of
something.

Varying the motion: Other types of motion detectors
In case you have a special interest in surveillance and want to know more
about motion detectors, we take a moment here to give you the lowdown on
a couple of other types:
 Active infrared motion sensor: This sensor uses an LED that emits
infrared light and a detector, such as a phototransistor, that generates
current when infrared light strikes it. When someone passes between
the LED and the sensor, the phototransistor stops generating current.
This sensor is really just a version of the old-fashioned electric eye that
readers over 40 might remember from old James Bond movies, and you
can use it effectively only in areas with regular traffic, such as hallways.
 Ultrasonic motion detector: This detector generates ultrasonic waves
that reflect off any objects in the room. If nothing in the room moves, the
ultrasonic waves bounce back with no change. If someone or something
moves in the room, the ultrasonic waves distort, and that distortion
triggers an alarm. You don’t really have a compelling reason to use these
devices rather than the PIR detectors unless you have a special fondness
for ultrasonic gadgets.
You’re getting warmer: 
Temperature sensors
Remember when you were a kid lying in bed on a cold winter evening?
Suddenly, you heard a sound! But you quickly realized that it wasn’t the
boogeyman coming to get you — just the furnace turning on in your cold
house. The thermostat in your wall activated the furnace because it sensed
that the temperature had dipped below the preset temperature. 
A thermostat uses a coiled metal strip (called a bimetallic strip) that shrinks as
the temperature cools. When the coil shrinks to the point you set on your ther-
mostat, it trips a switch and turns the furnace on. This is a simple and common
type of temperature sensor that you use in certain types of gadgets, such as
the thermostat. Other types of temperature sensors, including thermocouples,
semiconductor temperature sensors, infrared temperature sensors, and therm-
istors measure changes in temperature electrically, rather than mechanically,
as with the bimetallic strip. 
To make your life a little easier, we suggest that you just stick to using ther-
mistors for projects where you want to measure temperature because they
are generally easier to use than thermocouples and infrared temperature
sensors. A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance value changes with
changes in temperature. 
113
Chapter 5: Filling Out Your Parts Bin
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

There are two types of thermistor:
 Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors: The resistance of
this type of thermistor decreases with a rise in temperature.
 Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) thermistors: The resistance of
this type of thermistor increases with a rise in temperature.
You should find an NTC or PTC marking on your thermistor; if you can’t find
this marking, you can verify which type of thermistor you’re dealing with
when you calibrate it by identifying whether the value increases or decreases
with a rise in temperature.
Suppliers’ catalogues typically list the resistance of thermistors at 25 degrees
Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit). Measure the resistance of the thermistor
yourself with a multimeter (see Chapter 9 for more about using multimeters)
at a few temperatures; these measurements give you the resistance at each
temperature so that you can calibrate the thermistor. If you plan to use the
thermistor to trigger an action at a particular temperature, make sure to mea-
sure the resistance of the thermistor at that temperature. Thermistors have
two leads and no polarity, so you don’t need to worry about which lead you
have wired to +V.
114
Part II: Aisle 5, Component Shack: Stocking Up 
Other ways to sense temperature
In the section “You’re getting warmer:
Temperature sensors,” we mention several
other types of temperature sensors. Here, we
briefly summarize their characteristics for the
curious among you:
 Semiconductor temperature sensors: After
thermistors, these are probably the easiest
to use. The most common type of this sensor
contains two transistors. This sensor’s out-
put voltage depends on the temperature. 
 Thermocouples: These sensors generate a
voltage that changes with temperature.
Thermocouples contain two wires (for
example, a copper wire and a wire made of
a nickel/copper alloy) welded or soldered
together at one point. The metals it uses
determine how the voltage changes with
temperature. You can use thermocouples to
measure high temperatures, such as sev-
eral hundred degrees or even over a thou-
sand degrees.
 Infrared temperature sensors: These sen-
sors measure the infrared light given off by
an object. You can use these sensors when
the sensor must stay at a distance from the
object you plan to measure; for example,
you use this sensor if a corrosive gas sur-
rounds the object. Industrial plants and sci-
entific labs typically use thermocouples and
infrared temperature sensors.

Good Vibrations with DC Motors
Have you ever wondered what causes a pager to vibrate? No, not Mexican
jumping beans: These devices usually use a DC motor. DC motors change elec-
trical energy, such as the energy stored in a battery, into motion. That motion
may involve turning the wheels of a robot that you build or shaking your pager.
In fact, you can use a DC motor in any project where you need motion.
Electromagnets make up an important part of DC motors because these
motors consist of, essentially, an electromagnet on an axle rotating between
two permanent magnets, as you can see in Figure 5-8.
The positive and negative terminals of the battery connect so that each end of
the electromagnet has the same polarity as the permanent magnet next to it.
Like poles of magnets repel each other. This repelling action moves the electro-
magnet and causes the axle to spin. As the axle spins, the positive and negative
connections to the electromagnet swap places, so the magnets continue to
push the axle around. A simple mechanism consisting of a commutator (a
segmented wheel with each segment connected to a different end of the elec-
tromagnet) and brushes that touch the commutator cause the connections to
change. The commutator turns with the axle and the brushes are stationary,
with one brush connected to the positive battery terminal and the other brush
to the negative battery terminal. As the axle, and therefore the commutator,
rotates, the segment in contact with each brush changes. This in turn changes
which end of the electromagnet is connected to negative or positive voltage.

If you want to get a feel for the mechanism inside a DC motor, buy a cheap
one for a few dollars and tear it apart.
The axle in a DC motor rotates a few thousand times per minute — a bit fast
for most applications. Suppliers sell DC motors with something called a gear
head pre-mounted; this device reduces the speed of the output shaft to under
a hundred revolutions per minute (rpm). This is similar to the way that
changing gears in your car changes the speed of the car.
Suppliers’ catalogs typically list several specifications for the motors they
carry. Two key things that you need to consider are
 Speed: Listed as rpm (revolutions per minute). The speed that you need
depends on your project. For example, when turning the wheels of a
model car, you may aim for 60 rpm, with the motor rotating the wheels
once per second.
 Operating voltage: The operating voltage is given as a range. Electronics
projects typically use a motor that works in the 4.5- to 12-volt range.
Also notice the manufacturer’s nominal voltage and stated rpm for the
motor. The motor runs at this rpm when you supply the nominal voltage.
If you supply less than the nominal voltage, the motor runs slower than
the stated rpm.
DC motors have two wires (or terminals that you solder wires to), one each
for the positive and negative supply voltage. You run the motor by simply
supplying a DC voltage that generates the speed that you want and switching
off the voltage when you want the motor to stop.
You can use a more efficient method of controlling the speed of the motor
called pulse width modulation. This method turns voltage on and off in quick
pulses. The longer the on intervals, the faster the motor goes. If you’re build-
ing a kit for something motor-controlled, such as a robot, the electronics for
the kit supplies this speed control.
If you’re attaching things such as wheels, fan blades, and so on to the motor
shaft, be sure that you have attached the component securely before you
apply power to the motor. If not, the item may spin off and hit you, or some-
one near and dear to you, in the face.
So You Want to Make Some Noise?
So, you’ve probably asked yourself at one time or another, just what is
sound? Sound is simply a series of vibrations traveling through the air. When
you talk, for example, your vocal cords vibrate to create sound waves that
travel to a listener’s ear.

In electronics, you can use speakers and buzzers to create sound. In fact, the
world of electronics tends to be a noisy one: You can activate music, buzzers,
alarms, and other sounds with your electronic gadgets. In the following sec-
tions, we explore these devices that you can use to get your project heard.
Speaking of speakers
Most speakers simply consist of one permanent magnet, an electromagnet,
and a cone. Figure 5-9 shows how the components of a speaker are arranged. 
The electromagnet is attached to the cone. When electric current moves
through the electromagnet, it either gets pulled toward the permanent
magnet or (if the electric current goes in the other direction) pushed away
from the permanent magnet. The motion of the electromagnet causes the
cone to vibrate, which creates sound waves.
You state the frequency range over which a speaker generates sound in Hz
(hertz) or kHz (kilohertz). The human ear can hear sound over a frequency
range of about 20Hz to 20kHz. Speakers generate sound over various ranges,
depending on their size and design (for example, in a stereo set up, one
speaker may generate in the bass range and another in a higher range). If
you’re just looking for a general-purpose speaker, don’t worry too much
about the frequency range. If you’re building a super-duper high-end audio
system, you probably want to spend a lot of time investigating and picking
out speakers that meet your needs.

In Chapter 1, we cover the units Hz and kHz in more detail.
Buzzers
Admit it — buzzers are cool. They can do everything from alerting you when
somebody’s coming into your room to scaring the cat off the couch.
How buzzers work
Here’s how a common type of buzzer works: Voltage applied to a piezoelec-
tric crystal causes the crystal to expand or contract. If you attach a
diaphragm to the crystal, changing voltage causes the diaphragm to vibrate
and generate sound waves. You call these buzzers piezo buzzers, referring to
the piezoelectric effect, the ability of certain crystals — quartz and topaz to
name a few — to expand or contract when you apply voltage to them.
Some buzzers use electromagnets. For beginners, we recommend the piezo
buzzer just to minimize the number of moving parts.
Buzzers have two leads and come in a variety of looks. Figure 5-10 shows a
couple of typical buzzers. To connect the leads the correct way, remember
that the red lead goes to positive DC voltage.

How noisy should your buzzer get?
A buzzer generates sound at one frequency; the specifications for a buzzer
indicate several things:
 The frequency of sound it emits: Most buzzers give off sound between
2kHz and 4kHz because humans can hear sound in that range very
easily.
 The operating voltage and voltage range: Just make sure that you get a
buzzer that works with the DC voltage that your project supplies.
 The level of sound it produces in units of decibels (db): A higher
number of db indicates a louder sound. Higher DC voltage (within the
voltage operating range of the buzzer) provides higher sound levels.
Be careful that the sound doesn’t get so loud that it damages your hearing.
You can start to get an annoying ringing in your ears at levels of around 85 db
and above.

magine driving cross-country without a roadmap. Chances are, you’d get
lost along the way and end up driving in circles. Roadmaps exist to help you
find your way. You can use roadmaps for building electronic circuits, as well.
They’re called schematic diagrams, and they show you how all the parts of the
circuits are connected. Schematics show these connections with symbols that
represent electronic parts and lines that show how you attach the parts.
Although not all electronic circuits that you encounter are described in the
form of a schematic, many are. If you’re serious at all about studying elec-
tronics, sooner or later, you need to understand how to read a schematic.
Surprise! The language of schematics isn’t all that hard. Most schematic dia-
grams use only a small handful of symbols for components, such as resistors,
capacitors, and transistors.
In this chapter, we tell you all that you really need to know so that you can
read almost any schematic diagram you come across.
What’s a Schematic, and
Why Should I Care?
If you know how to read a roadmap, you’re already well on your way to read-
ing a schematic. Schematic diagrams are a lot like maps, where lines connect
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

things. But where a roadmap uses lines to connect dots and stars that repre-
sent towns and cities, schematics use lines to connect symbols representing
resistors, transistors, and other components that make up a circuit.
Schematics serve two main purposes:
 Show you how to reproduce a circuit. By reading the symbols and fol-
lowing the interconnections, you can build the circuit shown in the
schematic.
 Give you an overview of a circuit so that you can better understand
how it works. You may find this knowledge useful if, for example, you
need to repair the circuit or replace a component.
Discovering how to read a schematic is a little like learning a foreign lan-
guage. On the whole, you find that most schematics follow fairly standard
conventions. However, just as you can speak many languages with different
dialects, the language of schematics is far from universal. Schematics can
vary depending on the age of the diagram, its country of origin, the whim of
the circuit designer, and many other factors.
In this book, we use conventions commonly accepted in North America. But
to help you deal with the variations that you may encounter, we also show
you some other conventions, including those used in Europe, and old-style
diagrams that use things like pre-digital age radio tubes.
Getting a Grip on Schematic Symbols
Today’s electronic circuit schematics use hundreds of symbols, and older cir-
cuits that use tubes and other components common in your grandpa’s day
use even more symbols. But you’re in luck — you need to remember only a
few dozen common symbols. The rest you can look up as you go.
In this chapter, we cover the most common electronic symbols, including
those for basic components, such as resistors and capacitors; logic symbols,
such as the AND and OR gate; transistors; and more. We cover symbols
alphabetically within the following four categories:
 Basic schematic symbols: Chassis and earth ground, connection points,
inputs, and outputs
 Electronic components: Resistors, transistors, diodes, and chokes
 Logic symbols: AND, OR, NOR, and inverter gates
 Miscellaneous symbols: switches, light bulbs, and other hardware

Getting the scoop on basic 
schematic symbols
Your run-of-the-mill, basic schematic symbols represent the mechanical
aspects of a circuit, such as the power source, how and where wires are
attached, and any connectors, jacks, and terminals.
Take a look at Chapters 4 and 5 for information about common components
such as connectors and jacks, and at Chapter 1 for information about elec-
tricity basics such as power source and ground.
Power and ground
The symbol for power looks like a long stick with a circle at the top. The
symbol for ground is a long line with three horizontal lines at the bottom.
Power for a circuit can come from an alternating current (AC) source, such
as the 117 VAC outlet in your house or office (so-called “line powered”), or a
direct current (DC) source, such as a battery or the low-voltage side of a wall
transformer. Ground is a connection used as a reference for all voltages in a
circuit.
Here are some of the ways schematics might appear based on the power
source that you use:
 In line-powered electronic circuits, you typically use an internal power
supply to step down (or lower) the 117 VAC, and convert it to DC. This
lower-voltage DC gets delivered to the components in the circuit. If you’re
looking at a schematic for a VCR or some other gadget getting its power
from a wall outlet, that schematic probably shows both AC and DC power.
 In DC circuits, the schematic may have one or more voltage sources,
such as +5 VDC, +12 VDC, and even -5 or -12 VDC. If a schematic doesn’t
specify a voltage, you’re often (but not always!) dealing with 5 VDC. And,
unless otherwise specifically noted, the voltage in a schematic is almost
always DC, not AC.
As we mention in Chapter 1, all electrical connections require a minimum of
two wires: one for power and one for ground. You may also hear ground
called return or common. As you can see in Figure 6-1, a schematic may show
the ground connection in a number of ways:
 No ground symbol: The schematic can show two power wires con-
nected to the circuit. In a battery-powered circuit, ground is the negative
terminal of the battery.
 Single ground symbol: The schematic shows all the ground connections
connected to a single point. It doesn’t show the power source, but the
ground always connects to the negative terminal of the battery or DC
power source.
125
Chapter 6: Reading a Schematic
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Multiple ground symbols: In more complex schematics, it is usually
easier to draw the circuit with several ground points. In the actual work-
ing circuit, all these ground points connect together.
There are two common forms of ground symbols: earth ground and chassis
ground (see Figure 6-2). Although schematics often use them interchange-
ably, these symbols actually mean different things.
An earth ground denotes a connection that you attach to the ground wire in
your house’s electrical system. The third (usually green) wire in a three-wire
power cord comes into play as an earth ground, for example.
Conversely, a chassis ground is the connection of wires in a low-voltage cir-
cuit. The term gets its name because, in older equipment, the metal chassis
of the device (hi-fi, television, or whatever) served as the common ground
connection. Using a metal chassis for a ground connection is not as common
today, but we still use the term “chassis ground,” just the same.

In this book, we use only the schematic symbol for earth ground because
most schematics that you see nowadays use that symbol as the standard.
Interconnections
You connect components in a circuit either by using insulated wires or thin
traces of copper on a circuit board. (You can read more about circuit boards
and discover how to make your own in Chapter 12.)
Most schematics don’t make a distinction about how you connect the compo-
nents together. That connection is wholly dependent on how you choose to
build the circuit. The schematic’s representation of the wiring merely shows
which wires go where.

Chapter 6: Reading a Schematic
Schematics aren’t perfect!
On those schematics that use neither a break
nor a loop, you only have the presence of the
dot to let you know that the wires should con-
nect but no indication when they don’t connect.
What happens if the person who drew the
schematic simply forgot the dot? Sorry to say,
you may find errors in schematic diagrams, just
like anything else. If you build a circuit from
such a schematic, and the circuit doesn’t work
when you first power it up, you may suspect a
missing wire connection somewhere. But
unless you’re familiar with electronics, deter-
mining which connection is missing isn’t always
easy. In these cases, consult with the person
who drew the schematic if you can, just to be
sure.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

With more complex schematics, some lines may have to cross over others.
You need to know when crossed lines represent a wire connection and when
they don’t. In the ideal modern schematic, you show connecting and non-
connecting wires like this:
 A break or loop indicates wires that don’t connect.
 A dot at the intersection of two lines shows the wires that do connect.
You can see some common variations in Figure 6-3.
This method of showing connections isn’t universal, so you have to figure out
which wires connect and which don’t by checking the drawing style used in
the schematic. For example, in any given schematic, connecting wires may
simply intersect, without a dot to indicate the intersection, in which case the
presence of an intersection is essentially unknown: there might, or might not
be a connection.

Jacks, plugs, and connectors
The first symbol here is a two-wire jack, and the second is a shielded jack,
two common types of jacks used in electronics. Most electronic circuits inter-
act with the outside world in some way. Take, for example, a guitar amplifier.
At the very least, it has a jack so that you can plug in the guitar’s cord. In
other circuits that you may encounter, you can use jacks, plugs, or other con-
nectors to interface with things, such as temperature probes, microphones,
or battery packs.
Here are the items that you most often use to make these connections:
 Jack and plug: These two items are a well-matched couple because a
jack is a receptacle for a plug. Or, using these words in a sentence,
“Fredricka plugged her headphones into the headphone jack of her
shiny new portable CD player.”
 Connector: A connector is a generic term for any fitting that allows you
to easily connect and disconnect wires to a circuit. The connector may
be some elaborate multi-socket arrangement, or it can be just two screw
terminals.
Symbols for jacks, plugs, and connectors can vary greatly among schematics.
The symbols that we use in this book are among the most commonly used. The
exact style of the symbol may vary from one schematic to the next, but the idea
still comes across — the connector provides you with a way to attach some-
thing to a circuit.
Symbols for electronic components
You can find literally hundreds of symbols for electronic components out
there because there are hundreds of them to depict. Fortunately, you proba-
bly encounter only a small number of these symbols in the schematics that
you run into.
This section begins with a discussion of labels that may accompany any com-
ponent in a schematic, and then covers the most common component sym-
bols, divided into categories.
As you go through this section, feel free to refer to Chapters 4 and 5 if you
need a refresher course on what a particular component does and what you
can use it for.
Component symbols like company
Component symbols don’t like to travel alone, so each component symbol in
a schematic is commonly accompanied by one or more of the following:
129
Chapter 6: Reading a Schematic
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Reference ID: An identifier, such as “R1” or “Q3.” The convention is to
use the letter to represent the type of component. The most common
letters are R for resistor, C for capacitor, D for diode, L for inductor, T for
transformer, Q for transistor, and U or IC for integrated circuit. If you
have several items of the same type, the numerical suffix (such as R3)
identifies that particular component.
 Part number: Used if the component is standard, such as a transistor or
integrated circuit, or you have a manufacturer’s custom product part.
For example, a part number may be something like 2N2222 (that’s a com-
monly used transistor) or 555 (a type of integrated circuit used in timing
applications).
 A value: Used if the component doesn’t go by a conventional part
number. Component values are typically used for non-solid-state parts,
such as resistors and capacitors. For example, when indicating a resis-
tor, the value — in ohms, K ohms (thousands of ohms), or megohms
(millions of ohms) — could be marked beside the resistor symbol
and/or the reference ID.
To indicate the circuit’s proper function, the schematic may also include
additional specifics about a component. For instance, you commonly can
assume that, unless otherwise noted, all resistors are rated at 1⁄4 or 1⁄8 watt.
When the circuit requires a different wattage — say a 1-watt or 10-watt power
resistor — you may write that wattage beside the symbol in the schematic. In
other cases, you may note any special considerations in the parts list, or as
an addendum to the schematic.
130
Part III: Putting It On Paper 
Reference ID primer
Components such as capacitors are often iden-
tified in a schematic using a letter, such as C for
capacitor, followed by the Reference ID number
(such as C2). The number identifies a specific
capacitor, and can be used in a parts list where
you note the precise value of the capacitor to
use, if that value isn’t also printed beside the
capacitor symbol. The following letters are
among those most commonly used. Note that
some components use abbreviations instead of
single letters, but the intent is the same:
C - Capacitor
D - Diode
IC (or U) - Integrated circuit
L - Inductor 
LED - Light-emitting diode
Q - Transistor
R - Resistor
RLY - Relay
T - Transformer
XTAL - Crystal
In various headings in this chapter when you
see a letter in parenthesis (as in the heading
that follows) it’s reminding you of the letter
abbreviation for that component.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Capacitors (C)
The schematic diagram of a capacitor reflects its internal construction: two
conductive plates separated by a small gap. The small gap and its contents
are called the dielectric. As we discuss in Chapter 4, the dielectric can be air,
liquid, or some form of insulator (such as plastic or mica).
Capacitors can be either polarized or non-polarized. Schematics show the
polarity with a + (plus) symbol, though on the capacitor itself, the polarity can
be marked with either a + (plus) or – (minus) symbol next to one of the leads.
Crystals and resonators (XTAL)
You use crystals and resonators to provide an accurate time base for elec-
tronics circuits. When you use these components with the appropriate oscil-
lator circuit, the crystal or resonator generates a series of pulses, sort of like
a metronome. The symbol for a crystal looks a lot like a capacitor, except
that a crystal symbol has a rectangle between the end plates.
Diodes (D)
You can find many kinds of diodes out there, including rectifiers, Zeners, and
light-emitting diodes (LED). Figure 6-4 shows an assortment of the most
common diode types: The standard rectifying diode, a Zener, the LED, and
the photodiode. You can use LEDs as indicator lights and photodiodes to
detect light. The sensor for your VCR’s remote control is an example of a pho-
todiode. And you commonly find bridge diodes in power supply circuits that
convert AC voltage to DC.
Inductors (L)
Inductors are coils of wire that you often see used in radio frequency (RF) cir-
cuits, such as AM radios and transmitters. The symbols for various types of
inductors are quite similar to each other and easy to spot; the main differ-
ence among inductors relates to what makes up the core. The most common
core materials are air and iron.

Operational amplifiers (U or IC)
Operational amplifiers are a type of integrated circuit because they are actu-
ally circuits within a circuit. They combine, in a single component, all the
necessary circuitry to amplify a signal. Schematics commonly use the symbol
that you see here for almost any amplifier, not just an operational amplifier.
The basic operational amplifier (op-amp) has two inputs (one shown with a +
sign, the other with a – sign) and a single output.
Relays (RLY)
You use relays to open and close a circuit while using another voltage (typi-
cally a smaller one) as a control. Relays differ from one another in the number
of contacts that they contain. The symbol you see here is a double-pole, single-
throw (DPST) relay. When working with relays, be sure to keep the control
voltage (shown connected to the coil) separate from the contact voltage
(shown connected to the contacts of the relay) because the two voltages may
differ and are not intended to be switched.
Resistors (R)
Resistors may be the most common component of any electronic circuit.
Resistors can be either fixed or variable. In a fixed resistor, the resistance
never varies. In a variable resistor, the resistance can be changed. What
effects the change depends on the construction of the variable resistor. In
some cases you manually effect the change, for example, by turning a knob;
or the change can be caused by an outside stimulus, such as a change in
light, voltage, or temperature. See the section “One Size Fits All: Adjustable
Components,” later in this chapter for more about variable resistors.
Transistors (Q)
You often use a transistor in circuits to function either as a switch or as an
amplifier. Most transistors have three wires (sometimes four). The arrows
in the symbol indicates the type of transistor. For example, in a bipolar PNP
transistor type, the arrow faces the base. In a bipolar NPN transistor type,
the arrow faces away from the base. (To catch up on the parts of a transistor,
such as the base, you can review Chapter 4).
Bipolar transistors are among the most common transistors, but you can also
run into other transistor types, such as the field-effect transistor (FET) and
the unijunction transistor (UJT). Also note that there are light-sensitive tran-
sistors that switch on when exposed to light. You can see symbols for PNP,
NPN, and FET transistors types in Figure 6-5.
Transformers (T)
Transformers do just what their name implies: They transform an electric
current and voltage to either a higher or lower value. You commonly find
transformers in two sections of a circuit:
132
Part III: Putting It On Paper 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Power supply section: Where you use the transformer to step down the
117 VAC line voltage to a lower level, such as 12 or 18 volts
 Audio output section: To change the impedance (the measure of opposi-
tion in an electrical circuit to a flow of alternating current) of the circuit
to a level suitable for driving an audio speaker
Logic gate symbols
Schematic diagrams for many digital circuits use logic gate symbols. Logic
gate symbols indicate the action that occurs in response to the two possible
voltage states (on or off). Other than power, these voltage states are the only
two present in a digital circuit. You can see the most common logic symbols
in Table 6-1.
If logic gates are a mystery to you, go to Chapter 5 to study up on what they
are, how they work, and their possible states of on/off or high/low.

Although you can create AND, OR, and other digital logic gates with transis-
tors, most circuits use an integrated circuit chip (called an IC). One IC con-
tains a number of individual logic gates. For example, the 7400 integrated
circuit contains four gates sharing a single power connection. 
Some schematics show individual logic gates, and some show connections to
the full integrated circuit. You can see an example of each in Figure 6-6.
Whether the schematic uses individual gates or an entire IC package, it usu-
ally notes the power connections. When it doesn’t, you have no choice but to
look up the so-called pinout of the device in a reference book. The pinout is a
reference sheet that indicates what each of the connections, or pins, of the
integrated circuit is used for. You can often find pinout diagrams on data
sheets that manufacturers of integrated circuits provide. You can locate them
on the Web using your favorite search engine.
Miscellaneous symbols
You may run across several miscellaneous symbols used in schematics to
represent various kinds of electronic gear. For the most part, these symbols
are self-explanatory, so we keep things simple and to the point in this section.
However, take special note of the symbols used for switches. The schematic
symbol for the switch indicates the number of poles (connections) and posi-
tions in the switch. Each pole can switch a different part of the circuit, such as
a portion of a circuit that requires a different voltage. (Switches are covered
in more detail in Chapter 7).
134
Part III: Putting It On Paper 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Here are some common switch types, and some variations you will encounter
as you build electronics projects:
 A single-pole, single-throw (SPST) switch has one position (on-off) or
“throw,” and only one pole.
 A double-pole, double-throw (DPDT) switch has two positions (on-on, or
on-off-on) and two poles.
 Other variations include DPST (double-pole, single-throw) and switches
with three or more poles.
 In addition to the poles and throws, some switches are spring-loaded
(called “momentary switches”). These switches are either normally
open (NO) or normally closed (NC). The normal state occurs when the
switch isn’t being pressed. For example, a normally open switch doesn’t
make electrical contact until you press it.

Getting Component Polarity Right
Many, though not all, components use polarized connections. To make sure
that these components function properly, you have to connect them in the
circuit in just the right way. In some instances, reversing a component from
its proper polarity can permanently damage it and other components in the
circuit.
Figure 6-7 shows how schematics identify polarity when using various
components.

Be sure to observe polarity when working with the following common
components:
 Diodes: Including rectifier, Zener, and light-emitting types. Schematics
indicate polarity with a short line, which represents the cathode (nega-
tive) terminal of the diode.
 Some capacitors: Electrolytic, tantalum, and several other special types.
Schematics indicate polarity with a + (plus) sign.
 Transistors: Schematics show polarity by the type of the symbol.
 Logic gates and other integrated circuits: Schematics show polarity by
the labels or other markings on the symbol.
 Op amps: An op-amp has three connections (besides power): two inputs
and the output. The inputs are marked + (non-inverting) and (–) inverting.

One Size Fits All: Adjustable Components
Several types of electronic components are adjustable. Instead of operating
at just one value, you can manually adjust the component to operate at a
range of values.
The most common adjustable components you encounter (whose symbols
you can see in Figure 6-8) are
 Variable resistor: Also called a potentiometer (or pot). Perhaps the
most common of all variable components, you use this resistor for
volume control, dimming lights, and thousands of other applications.
The potentiometer consists of a resistive element wired between two
terminals (such the filament in a lightbulb). On a third terminal, a wiper
registers changing resistance as you turn the potentiometer knob.
Figure 6-8 shows how schematics present potentiometers.
 Variable capacitor: You most often use a variable capacitor in a tuning
circuit, such as an AM radio. The capacitor consists of two or more
metal plates separated by air. Turning the knob changes the capacitance
of the device.
 Variable coil: Like a variable capacitor, you most often use a variable
coil in a tuning circuit. A typical construction uses a coil of wire sur-
rounding a movable metal slug. By moving the slug, you change the
inductance of the coil.

Photo-Sensitive Components 
Help You See the Light
Special light-dependent versions of resistors, diodes, and transistors react to
changes in illumination. The value of the component varies depending on the
amount of light that strikes it. Most schematics show the light-sensitive
nature of the component by using one or two arrows pointing into the body
of the component.
Table 6-3 shows several common schematic symbols for light-sensitive com-
ponents: Photocells/photoresistors, photodiodes, phototransistors, and solar
cells.

Alternative Schematic Drawing Styles
The schematic symbols in this chapter belong to the drawing style used in
North America (particularly in the United States) and in Japan. In some coun-
tries, notably European nations as well as Australia, somewhat different
schematic symbols are used. If you’re using a schematic for a circuit not
designed in the United States or Japan, you need to do a wee bit o’ schematic
translation in order to understand all the components.

Figure 6-9 shows a sampling of schematic symbols commonly used in the
United Kingdom and Europe. Notice that there are some obvious differences
in the resistor symbols, both fixed and variable.
This style organizes its symbols differently than the American style. In the
United States, you express resistor values over 1,000 ohms in the form of 6.8K
or 10.2K, with the K following the value. The European schematic style elimi-
nates the decimal point. Typical of schematics you’d find in the United
Kingdom are resistor values expressed in the form of 6K8 or 10K2. This style
substitutes the K (which stands for kilohms, or thousands of ohms) for the
decimal point.
You may encounter a few other variations in schematic drawing styles, but all
are fairly self-explanatory and the differences are not substantial. After you
learn how to use one style of drawing, the others come easily.

magine that you’re building a cute little cottage rather than an electronic
gadget. You have to know about the tools and materials that you need to
build the thing, and you need to gain skills, such as carpentry and plumbing.
But before you begin sawing and plumbing, you have to have a blueprint that
gives you an idea of what the final product should look like. That’s what a
schematic is: A blueprint of an electronic circuit that forms the basis of your
electronic gadget.
This chapter covers the basics of electronic circuits and examines the basic
building blocks that let you trace through the schematic for any project and
understand how a circuit functions. There’s one prerequisite with this chapter:
it’s really important that you read Chapter 6 before you read this one so you

What the Heck Is a Circuit?
An electronic circuit is simply a collection of components connected together
with wires through which an electric current moves. You can think of a circuit
as composed of five parts:
 A power source
 Components, such as resistors and transistors
 Wires to connect everything together
 An output device (also referred to as the load), such as a speaker
 Ground to complete the circuit
 Many, but not all circuits, also have an input
A Very Basic Circuit
You don’t want to start building houses by tackling a 36-room mansion with a
complex home stereo system wired into the walls and a maze-like set of secret
passages in the basement, right? You also shouldn’t start your exploration of
electronic circuits with anything overwhelming. So we start you off with the
equivalent of building a shed: A simple circuit that powers a light bulb.
Powering a light bulb
One of the simplest circuits that you encounter involves a light bulb and two
wires that connect the bulb to a power source. However, you may not find this
circuit very practical because the light bulb is always on. Adding a switch to
turn the light on or off makes the circuit much more useful. Figure 7-1 shows
the schematic of a circuit that contains a light bulb and switch.

Part III: Putting It On Paper 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

The circuit in Figure 7-1 has the switch in the closed position. When it’s closed,
it completes the circuit and allows electrons to travel from the negative battery
terminal through the light bulb to the positive battery terminal. The light bulb
contains a filament that heats up and emits light when the electrons pass
through it.
On the other hand, when you have the switch in the open position, such as
shown in Figure 7-2, there’s a break in the circuit. Because of this break in the
circuit, electric current can’t flow. No current, no light.
A flashlight works in the same way. When you turn on the flashlight, a switch
completes the circuit between the light bulb and the battery and allows elec-
tric current to flow. When you turn off the flashlight, you open the circuit,
which prevents electric current from flowing.
Controlling the current with a resistor
Say you’re building a model railroad and you want to dim the light over the
station platform. Just add a resistor to the circuit. Figure 7-3 shows the circuit
in Figure 7-1 with a resistor added.
In Chapter 4, we explain that resistors “resist” electric current (makes sense,
huh?). Adding a resistor reduces the amount of electrons flowing through the
circuit. When fewer electrons flow through the filament in the light bulb, the
filament emits less light.

You can use Ohm’s Law (for a quick review of this handy rule, see Chapter 1)
to calculate the amount of current flowing through this circuit before and
after you add the resistor. If the resistance of the light bulb is 5 ohms and the
battery applies 3 volts, then you calculate the current like this:
I
R
V
5 ohms

Here I represents the current, V stands for the voltage, and R represents the
resistance.
When you add a 5-ohm resistor to the circuit, the total resistance of the cir-
cuit becomes 10 ohms, and you calculate the current as:

The resistor cuts the current running through the light bulb’s filament in half.
This current cutting reduces the amount of light over your train station plat-
form, allowing the tiny stationmaster to catch a few winks.
Parallel (or Series) Parking
Your Light Bulbs
You can arrange components in series so that the same current runs through
each component, or you can arrange them in parallel so that one batch of
current runs through one component and another batch of current goes
through another component, and so on. In the following sections, you can see
just how series and parallel circuits work.
Circuits: The series
In the circuit in Figure 7-3, electrons flow from the negative battery terminal,
through the light bulb and then go on to run through the resistor before
reaching the positive battery terminal. You call this set-up a series circuit,
meaning that the current runs through each component sequentially. You can
calculate the total resistance of a series circuit simply by adding together the
resistances of each component.
Figure 7-4 shows another example of a series circuit with 4 resistors.
To calculate the total resistance of this circuit, or Rt, simply add the values of
all 4 resistors:
Rt = 220 Ω+ 33 Ω+ 10 Ω+ 330 Ω= 593 Ω
144
Part III: Putting It On Paper 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You can use this value of Rt with Ohm’s Law to calculate the current in the cir-
cuit. So, if +V (supply voltage) equals 9 volts:

Why should I care about the total current in a circuit, you ask? There are two
really good reasons:
 Even the hardiest components can only handle a certain amount of cur-
rent; for example, an LED would probably burn up if you ran more than
50 milliamps through it.
 On the other hand, your power supply or batteries can only supply a
given amount of current. The level of current calculated here, 15 mil-
liamps, is no big deal. However, the next example uses over 1 amp of
current, which raises the bar for your power supply or battery. Bottom
line: To make things run, make sure that you have an adequate power
source to supply as much current as the circuit requires for as long as
you need it to run.
There is a potential problem that you may run into with series circuits: If
one component fails, it stops the flow of current to every component in the
circuit. So, if your spiffy new restaurant sign sports 200 light bulbs wired
together in series and one burns out, every one of the light bulbs goes dark.
Parallel circuits
There’s a way to fix the problem of all components in a series circuit blacking
out when one item fails. You can wire components in a parallel circuit, such
as the circuit in Figure 7-5. With a parallel circuit, if you burn out a few bulbs
in your restaurant sign, the rest of it stays lit. (Of course, you may be left with
a glowing sign reading, “WORLD’S BEST FOO.” There are pros and cons to
everything.)

Here’s how the parallel circuit in Figure 7-5 works: Electrons flow from the nega-
tive battery terminal, through each resistor, and finally to the positive battery
terminal. The electrons flowing through one resistor don’t flow through the
other resistors. So, if your restaurant sign has 200 light bulbs wired together in
parallel and one burns out, light still shines from 199 light bulbs.
You calculate the total resistance of the circuit in Figure 7-5, referred to as Rt,
by using the following equation:

In a series setup, you calculate Rt by finding the sum of all the resistances. In
a parallel circuit, the Rt of the circuit is a smaller value than the smallest
resistor (in Figure 7-5, 7.2 Ωversus 10 Ωfor the smallest resistor).
You can calculate the total current running through this circuit by using Rt in
Ohm’s Law. Again, using a +V of 9 volts, you get a total of 1.25 amps using this
equation:

In this example, if you run your project off of batteries, you probably drain
them of power in a relatively short time. Batteries have ratings of amp hours.
A battery with a rating of one amp hour only lasts for an hour with a circuit
drawing one amp. Therefore, your decision about what power source to use
must take into account both the current a circuit draws and how long you
want to run the circuit.
Exploring a Voltage Divider Circuit
Time for a test (don’t worry, its open book): In Chapter 1, we state that voltage
is a force that pulls electrons through a wire. If you put that together with the
information we provide in Chapter 4, that resistors “resist” electrons going

through them, what can you conclude? If you said that as voltage pulls elec-
trons through resistors (or any other component), the resistor uses up some
of the voltage, you’d get an A+. You call this lowering of voltage a voltage drop.
A circuit called a voltage divider uses voltage drops to produce voltage lower
than the supply voltage at specific points in the circuit. Figure 7-6 shows a
voltage divider circuit. For example, it’s standard to supply 5 volts to a tran-
sistor, but let’s say you have a power supply of 9 volts. You can use a voltage
divider to reduce the voltage to 5 volts.
The voltage dropped across each resistor is proportional to the value of the
resistor divided by the total resistance, like this:

You calculate the output voltage by taking the supply voltage minus the volt-
age dropped across the resistor, R1:
Vout = Vin – VR1 = 9 volts – 6 volts = 3 volts
But what if you need a different output voltage? Simply change the resistors.
For example, if you want the output voltage to be half of the supply voltage,
just use two resistors that have the same value. Then using the equation to
calculate the voltage dropped across R1:
Voltage dropped across R1 = one half of Vt.
If you need the output voltage to be two-thirds of the supply voltage, use an
R1 that is one half the resistance of R2. Then using the equation to calculate
the voltage dropped across R:
Voltage dropped across R1 = one third of Vt.
R1 = 220Ω 
R2 = 110Ω

Measuring Current with Voltage
Just as the average human body can take only so much fast food, the most
common testing tool of electronics, multimeters, can handle only so much
current. When the current flowing through a circuit is too high for you to
measure directly with your multimeter (see Chapter 9 for more about work-
ing with multimeters), you can measure the voltage drop across a resistor
with the multimeter instead and calculate the current from the voltage drop.
Figure 7-7 shows a sample circuit where a very small value resistor has been
inserted into the circuit to allow you to make this measurement without
disturbing the values in the circuit.
In this example, you place the resistor in an existing circuit in series with the
other components to determine the amount of current flowing in the circuit.
You use a 1-ohm, 10-watt resistor because you don’t need to worry about a
change of 1 ohm resistance in most circuits; the 10-watt rating prevents the
resistor from being burned up in most circuits.
Use the multimeter to measure the voltage drop across the resistor, from the
voltage measurement point (noted in Figure 7-7) to ground. You can then use
Ohm’s Law to calculate the current. If, for example, the multimeter measures
2 volts, you calculate the current in this way:
Ω

You probably should check the power that you plan to run through the resis-
tor to ensure that the resistor doesn’t burn up like Atlanta in Gone with the
Wind. Calculate the power the resistor will draw by using another form of
Ohm’s Law:
Power = R x I2 = 1 Ωx (2 amps)2 = 4 watts
R1 = 1Ω

Using this equation you know roughly how much power the resistor will draw
based on your estimate of the amount of current in the circuit. Try to stay
25% below the power rating of the resistor or it could get REALLY hot. 
In most cases, a 10-watt resistor can withstand the demands of a simple elec-
tronics project. If you’re burning out 10-watt resistors right and left, you’ve
moved beyond electronics hobbyist to master electrician, and you need to
buy a much more advanced electronics book.
What a Team: Capacitors and Resistors
Batman and Robin. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Capacitors and
resistors . . . Huh? It’s true: Capacitors and resistors often team up in an elec-
tronic circuit. In fact, a capacitor and resistor arranged in a circuit make up
one of the basic building blocks of electronic circuits, such as the one shown
in Figure 7-8.
So why do these two make such a great team? That’s what this section is all
about.
How the dynamic duo of resistors
and capacitors works
A capacitor stores electrons, and a resistor controls the flow of electrons. Put
these two together, and you can control how fast electrons fill (or charge)
a capacitor and how fast those electrons empty out (or discharge) from a
capacitor.

The larger the value of a resistor, the less current flows through it for a given
voltage, which means it takes more time to fill a capacitor. Likewise, larger
capacitors require more electrons to fill them up, which means they take a
longer time to charge. By picking the combination of capacitors and resis-
tors, you can determine your project’s charge or discharge time.
Turning things on and off
It turns out that the voltage out (Vout) depends on how full the capacitor in
your circuit is. The closer to full, the higher Vout. The closer to empty, the
lower Vout. Because components use different levels of Vout, you can pick
values of resistance and capacitance to turn circuits on and off at a certain
frequency or after a certain amount of time.
What if you want a capacitor to charge in 30 seconds? You have a 15-microfarad
capacitor handy in your parts bin (well, who doesn’t?); using a 2-megohm resis-
tor sets the time that it takes the capacitor to get to two-thirds of its capacity.
Filling the capacitor to two-thirds of its capacity often gives a high enough
Vout to turn on the next component in the circuit. If it doesn’t, try a smaller
resistor so that the capacitor fills up faster. You can generally do things that
simply; take a capacitor that you have handy and calculate how many ohms
you need to get close to the desired seconds of delay.
You can calculate the time to fill a capacitor to two-thirds of its capacity
using something called an RC time constant. Simply multiply the values of the
resistor, in ohms, by the capacitor, in farads, and you get the time it takes to
fill the capacitor up to two-thirds of its capacity. (In Chapter 1, we discuss
how to change 15 microfarads to 0.000015 farads, a procedure we follow in
the equation below).
RC time constant = R x C = 2,000,000 ohms x 0.000015 farads = 30 seconds
150
Part III: Putting It On Paper 
Giving voltage fluctuations the boot 
with capacitors
You can use the ability of capacitors to gather
and release electrons to smooth out voltage fluc-
tuations. A given voltage level across a capaci-
tor produces a certain number of stored
electrons. When the voltage starts to rise, the
capacitor stores more electrons, which dampens
any rise in voltage. When the voltage drops, the
capacitor releases some of its trapped electrons,
which dampens the drop in voltage. Power sup-
plies that convert AC to DC often use capacitors
to smooth out fluctuations in voltage.

If you want to fine-tune the delay, use a resistor with a slightly smaller value
than you need and add a potentiometer (a variable resistor that allows for
continual adjustment of resistance from virtually no ohms to some maximum
value) in series with the resistor. Because the total resistance is the sum of
the value of the resistor and the potentiometer, you can increase or decrease
the resistance by adjusting the potentiometer. Just tweak the potentiometer
until you get the delay you want. Note that we cover potentiometers in more
detail in Chapter 4. 
Talking of Transistors
The word transistor doesn’t come from some obscure Latin noun; actually the
man who built the first one, Walter Brattain, figured that, just as the vacuum
tube had the property of transconductance, this new thingie had the electrical
property of transresistance. He also knew that a number of electronic devices
had come out recently with names, such as varistor and thermistor. Transistor
seemed to fit the bill, which is all well and good, but what exactly is the thing?
Simply put, a transistor controls the flow of electric current by opening and
closing a kind of valve within it.
You can use transistors as either a switch or an amplifier. In the following sec-
tions, we describe both applications.
Using a transistor as a switch
A switch simply opens or closes a path through which current flows. You can
use a transistor as an electrically operated switch. You can see the circuit for
a transistor used as a switch in Figure 7-9.
Take a closer look at what makes up a transistor. A transistor has three leads:
Base, emitter, and collector (which we discuss in Chapter 4). When you use a
transistor as a switch, the base lead of the transistor works like the toggle on
a mechanical switch.

When you’re not applying current to the base (that is, there’s no input current),
the transistor is off, which is equivalent to an open switch. Even with a voltage
difference between the other two leads of the transistor, no current flows
through the transistor.
When you supply current to the base of the transistor, it turns the transistor
on, which is equivalent to a closed switch. With the transistor on, a voltage
difference between the other two leads of the transistor causes a current
to flow through the transistor and out to whatever doohickey you want to
turn on.
How does this on-off thing work in practice? Say that you use an electronic
gadget to automatically scatter chicken feed at dawn. The gadget is controlled
by a photodiode (similar to a solar cell) in your henhouse, which supplies the
input to the transistor. At night, the photodiode doesn’t generate any current,
and the transistor is off. When the sun rises, the photodiode generates cur-
rent, and the transistor turns on. When the transistor turns on, current goes
to the gizmo that you built to scatter chicken feed so that you can sleep late
and the chickens stay happy.
Wait a minute you ask, why not just supply the current from the photodiode to
the gizmo? Your gizmo might need a larger current than can be supplied by the
photodiode. For example, it might need the current you get from a battery. By
using the transistor as a switch you can control the current from the battery
with the much smaller current supplied by the photodiode. 
In ICs (integrated circuits) that contain logic gates like the ICs used by calcu-
lators and computers, transistors wired as switches are an integral part.
When is a transistor an amplifier?
We all need a helping hand from time to time. Why should electronic signals
be any different? You often need to amplify signals to get things done. For
example, you may have to amplify a signal from a microphone to drive a
speaker. Figure 7-10 shows the circuit of a basic one-transistor amplifier.
An amplifier must have a transistor partially turned on. To turn the transistor
partially on, you apply a small voltage to the base of the transistor. This pro-
cedure is called biasing the transistor. In the example in Figure 7-10, in order
to bias the transistor, resistors R1 and R2 are connected to the base of the
transistor and configured as a voltage divider (see the section “Exploring a
Voltage Divider Circuit,” earlier in this chapter). The output of this voltage
divider supplies enough voltage to the base of the transistor to turn the
transistor on and allow current to flow through it.
152
Part III: Putting It On Paper 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

When the amplifier receives an AC input signal, such as from a microphone,
the signal must be centered around 0 (zero) volts to maintain the bias. The
capacitor at the input filters out any offsets from 0 (zero) volts DC (called a
DC offset) in the input signal. You can see this effect in Figure 7-11.
This biased state is the major difference between using a transistor as an
amplifier and using a transistor as a switch. When you use a transistor as
a switch, you have the transistor either off or on. When using a transistor
as an amplifier, you apply a voltage, or bias, to the base to keep the transistor
partially turned on. Think of it like keeping a car running at idle.
There’s an advantage in leaving a transistor biased on because it responds to
any change in the input signal. A transistor requires about 0.6 volts applied
to the base (from the base to the emitter) to turn on. If you don’t have the
transistor turned on, any input signal below 0.6 volts doesn’t produce an
output signal. With the transistor biased on, it amplifies the entire input signal.
Figure 7-12 shows the effect of biasing a transistor on the output signal. Note
that in the output signal without bias, only a portion is amplified; the rest is
lost. In the output signal with bias, the entire signal is amplified.

The other two resistors that you can see in the circuit in Figure 7-10, R4
between the emitter and ground and R3 between the collector and +V, control
the gain. The gain is simply how much the signal is amplified. For example,
with a gain of 10, a 1-volt input signal becomes a 10-volt output signal.
What else can you do with transistors?
The circuit that we discuss in this section is a common emitter circuit. You
can also do the following things with circuits that include transistors:
 Wire them in common base circuits, which you use in radio frequency
applications or voltage regulators.
 Use PNP transistors rather than the more commonly used NPN
transistors.
 Wire them with more than one transistor, producing multiple stages of
amplification.

Let’s have more transistor amplifiers
The section titled “Talking of Transistors” gives
you a taste of transistor amplifiers, but where’s
the rest of the meal, you ask? In this chapter,
we explain the basics of electronics circuits; we
don’t really have room to give transistor ampli-
fiers a thorough going-over. If you now have a
basic understanding of how transistor ampli-
fiers work and can look at the schematic for a
project and understand how the transistors are
being used, we’re happy.
For you budding electronics Einsteins who just
have to know more, try getting your hands on a
good electronics design book, such as The Art
of Electronics by Thomas C. Hayes and Paul
Horowitz (Cambridge University Press). It’s not
cheap, but it’s a classic.

An Operational Amplifier
If one transistor is good, more transistors are better, right? An operational
amplifier is an IC containing several transistors, as well as other components.
An operational amplifier, usually called simply an op amp, performs much
better than an amplifier made from a single transistor. For example, an op
amp can provide uniform amplification over a much wider range of frequen-
cies than can a single-transistor amplifier.
Check out a basic circuit that uses an op amp in Figure 7-13.
Just put a signal (for example, from a microphone) to the input; the signal,
amplified several times, then appears at the output, where it can drive a com-
ponent, such as a speaker. The values of the resistors adjust the gain of the
amplifier (remember, gain simply means how much the signal is amplified).
You calculate the gain by dividing R2 by R1:
Gain
R1
R2
=
If R2 is 10 times R1, the gain is 10. This gain results in a 1-volt input signal
producing a 10-volt output signal.
An op amp requires both negative and positive supply voltages. A positive
supply voltage in the range of 8 to 12 volts and a negative supply voltage in
the range of -8 to -12 works.
The circuit in Figure 7-13 uses the op amp in an inverting mode, which means
that the input signal is flipped to produce the output signal. You generally
should use the inverting mode because of signal noise problems that you can
encounter with the non-inverting mode.

Simplifying a Project with
an Integrated Circuit
Whoever said that less is more must have been a fan of integrated circuits
(ICs). Using an IC in a project allows you to substitute one component for
several because many components are built into an IC. In this section, you
discover how to connect an IC into a circuit by connecting inputs, outputs,
ground, power, and some resistors and capacitors to the correct pins of the
IC, as you can see in Figure 7-14.
Which pin number you use to connect different parts of the circuit depends
on the design of the IC. You can identify these pins for each IC on the manu-
facturer’s data sheet or the schematic for a particular project.
In Figure 7-14:
 +V connects to pin 8, which is power, and pin 4, which is reset.
 Ground connects to pin 1.

 Pins 2 and 6, referred to respectively as the trigger and the threshold,
connect to the circuit between the capacitor and resistor, R1.
 Pin 7, the discharge pin, connects to the circuit between R1 and R2.
When you connect a 555 timer IC (an integrated circuit as a timer) in this way,
it generates a digital waveform from the output. The frequency of the wave-
form depends on how fast the capacitor fills and drains. You calculate how
fast the capacitor fills to two-thirds of its capacity or drains to one-third of its
capacity with the “RC time constant” equation which (discussed earlier in
this chapter in the section “Turning Things On and Off”).
The RC time constant for filling the capacitor is
T1= (R1 + R2) x C
The RC time constant for draining the capacitor is
T2 = (R1) x C
In this circuit, R1 and R2 determine how fast the capacitor charges and dis-
charges. The extent to which the capacitor is filled determines the voltage on
the trigger and threshold pins. When the voltage reaches two-thirds of V+, the
IC is triggered causing the output to change from +V to 0 (zero) volts and the
charge on the capacitor to drain through the discharge pin. As the capacitor
drains, the voltage to the IC trigger and threshold pins drops. When the volt-
age gets to one-third of +V, the IC is triggered again to bring the output voltage
from 0 (zero) to +V and to allow the capacitor to charge back up to two-thirds
of V+, at which point the cycle starts again. 
This sequence repeats and produces the digital waveform in Figure 7-14.
Changing the values of R1 and R2 changes the RC time constants, and hence
the shape of the digital waveform changes. In Chapter 14, you can see how to
use this type of output in actual projects.

oldering is the method you use in your electronics projects to assemble
components on a circuit board to build a permanent electrical circuit.
Instead of using glue to hold things together, you use small globs of molten
metal called solder. The metal not only provides a physical joint between the
wires and components of your circuit, it also supplies the circuit with the
conductivity it needs to work.
Despite working with temperatures in excess of 700 degrees Fahrenheit, sol-
dering is fun and generally safe (if you observe the normal precautions). You
need only a minimum of tools and supplies, most of which you can purchase
locally at hardware and home-improvement stores.
To Solder or Not to Solder
Before getting into the how’s of soldering, we’ll talk about the why’s. You don’t
need to solder all electrical circuits. You can use the solderless breadboard
method instead (meaning you insert components and wires into the holes
on a breadboard but don’t permanently affix them) to construct a working
circuit, especially if you’re just experimenting. 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You’re better off using a solderless breadboard if
 You’re just playing around with ideas. You may want to pull components
out and try new ones or experiment with different ways to connect things.
Although you can solder your circuit designs, any mistakes or changes
require unsoldering, which involves melting the solder and removing it
with a little suction device. With the solder removed, you can then pull
out the component.
 You’re testing your circuit to be sure that it works properly. Even the
best electronics experts try out their ideas before committing them to
permanent soldered status. With a solderless breadboard, you can more
readily make changes to improve the circuit.
 You don’t need or want a permanent circuit. You can build a simple
flasher circuit for a miniature Christmas tree display on a solderless
breadboard. The flasher circuit is a temporary circuit used for just a few
weeks out of the year. Come January 1, just tear it apart and reuse the
components (and breadboard) for something else . . . like a Valentine’s
Day blinking heart!
 You want to customize the circuit as you work with it. Rather than
building several options into one circuit, you may want to reconfigure it
to change its behavior. You can often make this change by switching out
basic components, such as resistors and capacitors. You can make such
changes in seconds with a solderless breadboard.
On the other hand, any circuit that requires permanence or that may be dam-
aged by ordinary handling almost always needs soldering. Here are some spe-
cific examples of when to solder the circuit, using some type of circuit board:
 Solder the circuit if handling, motion, or vibrations may work the con-
nections loose. This situation may be the case, for example, for any cir-
cuit that you mount in a car, such as a wind speed indicator, or the
electronic eyes you mount on a robot.
 A properly-soldered circuit lasts much longer than one mounted on
a solderless breadboard. If you plan on using the circuit for more than a
few weeks, permanently solder it.
 Soldered circuits are less prone to the effects of stray capacitance. Long
lead lengths on the components and in the construction of the solderless
breadboard itself, cause stray capacitance (where electric fields occur
between the two leads and energy is stored, as it is in a capacitor). Stray
capacitance can affect the operation of circuits in unpredictable ways. You
notice these effects most with circuits that already rely on capacitors for
signal timing.
 We highly recommend soldering for any circuit, such as a power supply
that directly plugs into a wall socket. You have less risk of shock or fire if
you securely solder all wiring and components to a rigid circuit board or
terminal.

Chapter 8: Everything You Need to Know about Soldering
 Soldering is also the best method for any circuit that uses high currents,
such as a motor driver for your remote control race car. Solderless
breadboards can’t support more than an amp or two of current; if you use
more current, things start melting.
Things You Absolutely, Positively
Need for Soldering
You’ll be glad to hear that you only need some pretty simple tools for solder-
ing. You can purchase a basic, no-frills soldering setup for under $10, but the
better soldering tools cost you more.
Here’s a rundown of the basic soldering tools that you need:
 Soldering pencil. A soldering pencil, also called a soldering iron, is a
wand-like tool that consists of an insulating handle, a heating element,
and a polished metal tip (see Figure 8-1). It’s pretty obvious why you call
it a pencil. It looks a lot like a good old #2. The more generic soldering
iron takes many forms, including a large gun-like appliance that was
common from the 1940s through the ‘60s. Don’t use these big soldering
irons with modern electronics because they produce way too much
heat. For standard electronics work, you want a soldering pencil rated at
25 to 35 watts. A 27- or 30-watt pencil is ideal. Be sure to get a soldering
pencil with a replaceable tip. That way when the old tip gets all worn
out, you can easily replace it.
 Soldering pencil stand. The better soldering pencils come with a stand,
but many low-cost ones don’t. You want to get your hands on one if your
soldering pencil is stand-less. A stand holds the hot soldering pencil
when you’re not using it, and it helps prevent accidents. Trust us: You
really don’t want the hot soldering pencil to roll off the desk and onto
your lap. Ouch!
 Solder. Solder is the soft metal that the heat of the soldering pencil
melts. The ideal solder for working with electronics is called 60/40 rosin
core. This name refers to the fact that the solder contains 60 percent tin
and 40 percent lead (the exact ratio can vary a few percentage points)
and has a core of rosin flux. This flux, which is a wax-like substance,
helps the molten solder flow around the components and wire, and it
assures a good joint. Solder comes in various diameters. A 0.062-inch
diameter is common. You may have more trouble using solder thicker
than about 0.080 inches on small circuits.
Sometimes you see solder sold by gauge, and sometimes by an actual diameter,
expressed in inches (or millimeters, for countries using the metric system).

Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
When you see the wire as a gauge, it’s important to note that the smaller the
number, the larger the solder diameter. Wander over to Chapter 5 for more
about wire gauge.
Here are two common solder gauges, along with their actual dimensions. 
Common Solder Gauges

Soldering releases toxic fumes. You can buy lead-free solder to avoid the effects
of lead poisoning. These solders contain other mixtures of metal, such as 95
percent tin and 5 percent antimony. But almost any soft metal that you can find
in solder — such as lead, bismuth, indium, or antimony — is toxic to one
degree or another. Always solder in a well-ventilated area, regardless of the
composition of the solder! As of this writing, no one has come up with a
completely non-toxic solder. Don’t use silver solder or any other solder not
specifically intended for electronics, especially solder designed for copper plumb-
ing pipes. These solders may not provide the same conductivity as standard
60/40 rosin core, and they may cause corrosion or leave contaminants that
could make the circuit completely inoperable.

Chapter 8: Everything You Need to Know about Soldering
Additional items useful for soldering that you can get in most hardware
stores include
 Wetted sponge: For wiping off excess solder and flux from the hot tip of
the soldering pencil. Just a basic (but clean!) kitchen sponge does the
trick. In a pinch, you can fold up a paper napkin, dampen it, squeeze out
any excess water, and use it like a sponge.
 4X to 6X magnifying glass: For inspecting your work. After soldering,
always check your solder joints to make sure they’re clean and well-
formed and that no solder touches adjacent wires or circuit board pads.
 Solder sucker: For removing excess solder. The sucker is a spring-loaded
vacuum. To use it, melt the solder that you want to remove and then
quickly position the sucker over the molten glob. Activate the sucker,
and it removes the extra solder.
 Rosin flux remover: Available in a bottle or spray can, use this after sol-
dering to clean any remaining flux to prevent it from oxidizing your circuit.
 “Third hand” clamp: Soldering would be a lot easier if everyone had
three hands. Alas, most people are born with only two, so the next best
thing is a small, weighted clamp that holds the parts while you solder.
You may hear these clamps referred to as “helping hands” or simply a
“third hand.” Figure 8-2 shows one of these clamps. You can purchase
them with or without an integrated magnifying glass.

Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
Choosing just the right soldering pencil
The basic soldering pencil you use for electronics work (shown in Figure 8-3)
is composed of a removable tip, and a 25- to 35-watt heating element. The
basic soldering pencil gets you soldering your circuits together, but not in
style. Although it costs a little more, a soldering pencil with an adjustable
temperature control gives you a better result. With these controls, you dial in
the best temperature for the job. 
If your soldering pencil doesn’t come with one, you need to get a separate
stand for it. Soldering stands are inexpensive, so don’t cheap out and just lay
the soldering pencil on your desk while you’re working. You’re bound to burn
your project, your desk, or yourself!
Although some of the higher-end variable-temperature soldering pencils
come with a digital readout, showing you the actual temperature at the tip,
you don’t really need this feature for basic electronics work, though it’s nice
to have as you build bigger and more complex circuits. With some practice
and experience, by watching how quickly the pencil melts the solder you can
figure out how to gauge the proper temperature setting.
Select a soldering pencil that comes with a grounded cord and plug. Many
people consider a grounded electrical plug to be safer, in the event that the
soldering pencil comes into contact with a live electrical circuit.
Selecting a soldering tip
The soldering tip attaches (it usually screws on) to the end of the heating
element. The tip does the actual soldering. You can choose from literally hun-
dreds of soldering tips, but don’t let that confuse you. For most electronics
work, you want a small conical or chiseled tip. These kinds of tips come in var-
ious sizes: 3⁄64-inch through 7⁄64-inch tips do the job for most electronics work.

Chapter 8: Everything You Need to Know about Soldering
You often can’t swap soldering tips among different brands of soldering pencil
or even different models by the same manufacturer. Be sure to purchase the
correct tip for your make and model of soldering pencil.
Replace soldering tips as they show signs of wear. Look for corrosion, pitting,
or plating that is peeling off. Replace tips that no longer provide adequate
heat or else your solder joints won’t be as strong as they should be because,
when soldering tips get old, they don’t pass as much heat. That can also slow
down your work. Eventually, if the tip gets really worn, it won’t ever make
enough heat to melt the solder.
Preparing Your Soldering Pencil
Before soldering, make sure you have all your tools within easy reach and
then follow these steps:
1. Dampen a small sponge or a folded-up paper towel. Squeeze out any
excess water.
You want it to be damp, not soaked.
2. Place the soldering pencil securely in its holder and plug it in.
3. If you have the adjustable type of pencil, turn the heat to approximately
675 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit.
4. Wait for the tool to reach proper temperature — usually within 60 sec-
onds for most 25- to 30-watt soldering pencils.
Many soldering pencils with a temperature sensor let you know when
they reach the proper temperature by lighting or blinking an indicator.
If the tip is new, tin it before soldering. Tinning is recommended because it
helps prevent solder from sticking to the tip and forming into an ugly globule.
If the globule comes off onto your circuit, then you could get a short. You tin
the tip by heating up the pencil to full temperature and applying a small
amount of solder to the tip. Wipe off any excess solder with a moistened
sponge or towel. Periodically use this same technique to keep the tip clean.
You can also purchase soldering tip cleaners if dirt becomes caked on and
you just can’t get it off during regular tip re-tinning. 
Successful Soldering
Successful soldering requires that you follow some simple rules and get a lot
of practice. Keep the following in mind as you solder:
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

168
Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
 The cleaner the metal surface, the better the solder sticks to it. Clean
etched circuit boards and wire ends with isopropyl alcohol. Let surfaces
dry thoroughly before soldering: You don’t want them to catch on fire!
 Hold the soldering pencil at a 30- to 45-degree angle to the work sur-
face. (See Figure 8-4.) If you’re using a chiseled tip, the flat of the chisel
should rest firmly against the surface of the joint that you’re soldering.
 Always apply the heat of the tip to the item that you’re working on,
not to the solder. If you’re soldering a wire into the hole of a circuit
board, for example, touch the tip to both the wire and the pad, like the
tip in Figure 8-5. Wait a few seconds and then apply solder to the heated
area. Immediately remove the heated tip after the solder flows.
 Apply just the right amount of solder. Too little, and you form a weak
connection; too much, and the solder may form globs that can cause
short circuits.
 You know you have just the right amount of solder when it forms a
raised area (called a fillet) between the wire and the circuit board.
 Avoid applying more solder to an already-soldered joint. This added
solder can cause what’s known as a cold solder joint and the result
could be that your circuit simply won’t work. (Check out the following
section, “Avoiding Cold Solder Joints like the Plague,” for more on this
soldering no-no.)

Chapter 8: Everything You Need to Know about Soldering
You can damage many electronic components if you expose them to prolonged
or excessive heat. Apply the soldering pencil only long enough to heat the
work for proper soldering — no more, no less.
When soldering electronic components that are very heat sensitive, use
a clip-on heat sink. These sinks look like miniature aluminum pliers, with a
spring-loaded clamp that you attach securely to the component you want to
protect. The sink draws off heat and helps prevent the heat from destroying
the component. Clip the sink to the wire that you’re soldering, as near to the
component itself as you can. Of course, you still have to exercise caution,
even when using a heat sink.
Avoiding Cold Solder Joints
like the Plague
A cold solder joint happens when solder doesn’t properly flow around the
metal parts. Cold joints are physically weaker than properly made joints, and
they don’t conduct electricity as well. You can often (but not always) identify
cold joints just by looking at them. A cold joint typically has a dull appear-
ance rather than the shiny, uniform look of a normal joint. And the solder
may form jagged peaks rather than having an all-around smooth surface.
Many things can cause a cold solder joint, such as:
 You move the work as the solder is cooling. Avoid all movement until
the solder cools beyond the plastic phase. (The plastic phase occurs
when the solder is still partially liquid and not yet hardened.) If you acci-
dentally jiggle the wire or component, quickly re-apply the tip of the sol-
dering pencil to reheat the solder back to its liquid state.
 The joint is dirty or oily. Be sure to keep all metal-to-metal contacts clean.

 You don’t heat the work to the proper temperature. Be sure that you
have the work hot enough to melt the solder to a somewhat runny liquid.
 You apply the solder to the soldering pencil and not to the heated work.
 You solder and then resolder the work. During soldering, the original
solder isn’t heated enough. It’s best to remove as much of the old solder
as possible and then completely remake the joint with all new solder.
When you experience all but the first item in the list above, you need to
unsolder the old joint and re-apply fresh solder. Avoid simply reheating the
solder; you rarely get the proper flow, and you’re likely to end up with
another cold joint. See the section “Unsoldering and Resoldering,” later in
this chapter for the proper procedure.
Avoiding Static Discharge
While Soldering
The soldering process can generate electrostatic discharge (ESD), which can
cause damage to sensitive electronics components and ruin your whole day.
Simply handling the components and circuit board can lead to static, as can
the soldering pencil itself. You can’t totally eliminate static discharge, but you
can minimize it.
Not all electrical components are static-discharge sensitive. But, for safety’s
sake, you should develop static-safe work habits when handling any electrical
components. For a list of major electronic components and their level of sus-
ceptibility to damage from static discharge, go to Chapter 2 and take a look at
Table 2-1.
Thwarting discharge before it begins
Here are a few things you can control to reduce the danger of static discharge:
 What you wear can have a great impact on the amount of static that
develops around you. Synthetic clothing tends to generate static.
Instead, wear natural cotton.
 If you’re working indoors on carpet, wear shoes instead of going bare-
foot or in socks.
 Wear an anti-static wrist band whenever possible. A wire from the wrist
band attaches to any grounded object and helps to draw off static from
your body. See Figure 8-6 for a picture of an anti-static wrist band.

Stocking up on anti-static supplies
You can go anti-static all the way by keeping these items handy:
 Anti-static work mat: Place an anti-static work mat on the floor under
your worktable, especially in carpeted rooms. This simple addition pre-
vents static buildup as you shuffle your feet.
Use an anti-static mat on your worktable, too. Avoid the nylon carpet that
electronics newbies typically use as a work mat; the carpet provides a
nice cushion for your projects, but it can generate static and even melt. 
 Anti-static spray: If you can’t find an anti-static work mat, get yourself a
bottle of anti-static spray. Some sprays actually attract dirt, so you may
need to clean your carpets more often.
 Anti-static bags: Keep static-sensitive electronic components in anti-static
bags until you’re ready to use them. (Most components come in these
bags, or they’re stuck into foam that has anti-static properties.) Minimize
handling components whenever possible.
Static buildup can turn into a serious problem in dry weather. If you live in a
dry climate, you need to take extra precautions against ESD. You can buy
humidifiers, electrically grounded anti-static mats, and other ESD control
products to reduce static, but these items cost serious money. Still, it’s
cheaper than moving to the rainforest.

Unsoldering and Resoldering
Even the experts sometimes insert a component backwards! It’s inevitable
that you occasionally need to undo a solder joint to fix mistakes or to clean
up a cold solder joint. When this situation happens, you need to remove the
solder at the joint and apply new solder.
You can use a desolder pump, solder wick, or both to remove solder from the
joint. 
Use solder wick (also called solder braid) to remove hard-to-reach solder.
The solder wick is really a flat braid of copper. It works because the copper
absorbs solder more easily than the tin plating of most components and
printed circuit boards. Exercise care when using solder wick because if you
touch the hot braid, you can get a serious burn.
I prefer the desolder pump. The desolder pump works by sucking up the
excess solder with a vacuum. Desolder pumps come in two basic styles:
spring-loaded plunger and bulb. They both work the same way in that they
suck up molten solder, but the spring-loaded plunger is a little easier to use.
That’s because the bulb requires a little more manual dexterity, as you need
to squeeze it one or more times with one hand, while holding the soldering
pencil over the joint you’re melting with your other hand 
Putting a spring-loaded plunger
desolder pump to work
Here are the steps you should follow to use a spring-loaded plunger desolder
pump:
1. Depress the plunger and then position the nozzle over the joint that
you want to remove.

All carpets aren’t created equal
Some types of carpets are more prone to static
than others. Regular nylon carpet can generate
massive amounts of static as you walk over it.
Be sure to drain the static from your body by
touching a doorknob or the metal portion of a
grounded appliance before touching any of your
electronic components or tools. Designers
make the fiber in many types of commercial car-
peting low-static. Consider this option if you
need carpeting for your workroom. As an alter-
native, you can buy small remnant pieces of
low-static or anti-static commercial carpeting
from a carpet dealer and place a remnant in
front of your workbench.

2. Carefully position the soldering tip into the joint to heat the solder.
Be careful not to touch the end of the desolder pump or you may
damage the nozzle.
3. When the solder begins to flow quickly, release the plunger to suck up
the solder.
4. Depress the plunger one more time to expel the solder from the pump
into a receptacle.
It’s a good idea to do this over a wastepaper basket so that you don’t
leave bits of solder debris on your workbench or in your project!
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 as needed until you remove as much of the
old solder as possible.
This bulb desolder pump definitely sucks
Bulb desolder pumps work a lot like the spring-loaded variety, except that
you squeeze the bulb to suck up the solder. You may have some problems
using these pumps unless you mount the bulb on the soldering pencil. You
can find some soldering pencils especially designed for desoldering that have
this arrangement.

Be sure to release the plunger when you’re done using the desolder pump.
The tool lasts longer that way, and it holds its vacuum better. Don’t store the
desolder pump with a cocked plunger because the rubber seal can become
deformed. If the seal gets deformed, the pump doesn’t create enough vacuum
to suck up any solder.
When you’ve removed the old solder, you may reapply solder to the joint,
following the instructions that you can find in the section “Successful
Soldering,” earlier in this chapter.
Soldering Tips and Techniques
Soldering isn’t rocket science. Still, you’d be wise to consider these tips, tech-
niques, reminders, and suggestions:
 Remember, cleanliness is king. Be sure that you keep all surfaces that
you’re going to solder free of dirt and oils. Otherwise, you may end up
with a weak soldered joint, or one that impairs conductivity.
 Metal dental picks make for good soldering tools. You can use the picks
to clean the work area prior to soldering and to scrape away excess
solder from a joint. You can get used (but clean!) dental tools from a
variety of mail-order surplus stores, including American Science &
Surplus. (See the appendix for more details.)
 Store your spool of solder in a resealable plastic bag. Doing this little
chore helps keep the solder clean. It may pick up dirt and oils if you
simply throw it into your toolbox. If the spool does get soiled, clean it
with isopropyl alcohol before using it.
 Allow the soldering pencil to cool completely before putting it away. If
you don’t use the soldering pencil often, put the cool pencil in a large
plastic bag to keep it clean.
 If you’ve grounded the electrical cord of your soldering pencil, be sure
to plug it into a grounded outlet. Don’t cut off the ground connector or
bypass the grounding by using an adapter. The manufacturers include
the ground for safety.
 After soldering, and when you’re sure that your circuit operates properly,
spray or brush on something called flux cleaner. This chemical removes
the left-over rosin residue, also called flux.
 You use the same general techniques we’ve described here to solder
surface mount components (teeny-tiny components that don’t have
wire leads). With practice, a steady hand, and a good eye (or a good
magnifying glass!), you can solder many types of surface mount compo-
nents. Don’t try this right away if you’re new to soldering, though. Get
some experience under your belt first.

multimeter is to an electronics geek as an oxygen tank is to a scuba
diver. Sure, you can hold your breath underwater, but not for long; you
soon have to come up for air. As a builder of cool electronics gadgets, you
can only experiment for so long before you need a multimeter to take you the
rest of the way.
With this one handy tool, you can not only verify proper voltages but also
test whether you have a short circuit or if there’s a break in a wire or connec-
tion. You’d be surprised how much troubleshooting you can do with just these
simple tests, and a multimeter does them all.
In this chapter, you learn the basics of using a multimeter to perform important
checks on electronic circuits and parts. These tests help you determine if
everything is A-OK or if you have a problem that Houston should know about.
The Basics of Multimeters
The multimeter, also called a volt-ohm meter (or VOM), is the basic tool for
anyone working in electronics. You can see a fairly typical modern multime-
ter in Figure 9-1.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You use a multimeter to take a variety of electrical measurements — hence
the term “multi.” With this one tool, you can
 Measure AC voltages
 Measure DC voltages
 Measure resistance
 Measure current going through a circuit
 Measure continuity (whether a circuit is broken or not)
And, depending on the model, you may also be able to test the operation of
diodes, capacitors, and transistors to see if they’re good.
All multimeters come with a pair of test leads, one black and one red (black is
for the ground connection; red is for the positive connection). Each test lead
comes equipped with a metal probe. For small, pocket units the test leads
come permanently attached to the meter. On larger models, you can unplug
the test leads.
If you don’t already own a multimeter, you should seriously consider buying
one. It’s well worth the relatively low cost, considering how much you’ll use
the meter. Prices for new multimeters range from $10 to over $100. The main

difference between the high- and low-priced meters is the features that you
get, such as built-in testing features for capacitors and transistors. Shop
around and compare features and prices. Know that, whatever you buy,
you’re going to have it for years to come. Consider getting the best multime-
ter that you can afford so that, as your projects grow more complex, your
multimeter can keep up.
Remember: Safety First!
Most tests using a multimeter involve low voltage and resistance, both of
which can’t hurt you much. But sometimes you may need to test high voltages,
such as the input to an AC-operated power supply. In a case such as this, care-
less use of the multimeter can cause serious bodily harm. Even when you’re
not actively testing a high voltage circuit, dangerous current may be exposed
if you work on certain electronics equipment, such as a radio, hi-fi, or VCR.
Remember this: If you ever need to work with an electronics project that uses
house current (117 volts in the US; 220 volts in many other countries) and
you touch a live AC wire, you can seriously hurt or even kill yourself. Always
exercise caution when handling electronic equipment and electric wires. Be
especially careful to keep your fingers away from the metal tips of the meter
test leads. The test leads are the wire probes that you use to connect the
multimeter to your circuit. If you handle the probes carelessly during testing
you may get a serious shock.
Never blindly poke around the inside of a circuit with the leads of a multime-
ter in an attempt to get a reading. Apply the test leads only to those portions
of the circuit that you are familiar with. One safe method for using a meter is
to attach a clip on the black (negative or common) lead and connect that
lead to the chassis or circuit ground. Use one hand to apply the red (positive)
lead to the various test points and stick the other hand safely in your pocket.
With one hand out of commission, you’re less likely to receive a nasty shock,
even if you aren’t watching what you’re doing.
Which to choose: Digital or analog?
Multimeters come in two general flavors: digital and analog. These names
don’t mean that you use one on digital circuits and the other on analog cir-
cuits. It’s a bit simpler than that:
 Digital multimeters use a numeric display, like a digital clock or watch.
 Analog multimeters use the old-fashioned — but still useful — mechanical
movement that uses a needle to point to a set of graduated scales.
Figure 9-2 shows an example of an analog multimeter.
177
Chapter 9: Making Friends with Your Multimeter

Digital multimeters used to cost more than their analog cousins, but the price
difference has evened out. Digital meters are fast becoming the standard. In
fact, although some manufacturers still make them, you have a hard time find-
ing a good analog meter anymore.
If you really, really want an analog multimeter, you may as well get a top-notch
one. But top-of-the-line analog multimeters can cost you a pretty penny if you
purchase them new. An alternative is to buy one through eBay. Try a search
for Simpson meter 260 — the Simpson Model 260 was one of the most popular
meters ever produced. They may look like relics by today’s standards, but as
long as no one has abused the meter, it should do all the basic tasks that you
need.
Traditionally, users have a harder time with analog multimeters because you
have to select the type of testing (voltage, current, or resistance), as well as
the range. You must then correlate the results using the proper scale on the
meter face and estimate the reading as the needle swings into action. In con-
trast, digital multimeters display the result as a precise number. Those num-
bers help take away the guesswork.

Taking a Close-Up Look at Multimeters 
Multimeters aren’t particularly complicated, but the following sections give
you some factoids that you should know before you choose one or use one.
We cover the basic functions shared by all meters, some of the dials that pro-
vide meter readouts, issues related to meter accuracy and the supplies that
come with the meter. You also need to know whether the meter automatically
adjusts itself to display the most accurate result possible (called auto-ranging)
and whether it has special testing features for checking diodes, capacitors,
and transistors. 
Basic features of every meter
Stripped down to its skivvies, a multimeter’s purpose is to take the three basic
measurements of electronics: voltage, current, and resistance.
Hello, any voltage or current in there?
You test voltage and current with a circuit powered up. Typical voltage and
current tests include
 Checking the voltage level of a battery. You can even check the voltage
when you’re using the battery. In fact, many consider this test more
accurate when the battery is providing power — what electronics folks
call under load.
 Determining if a circuit or component is drawing too much current.
If the circuit has more current going through it than it’s designed to
handle, then the components may get overheated and you can perma-
nently damage your circuit.
 Verifying that the proper voltage reaches a component, such as a light-
emitting diode or switch. These kinds of checks can help you pinpoint
the location of a problem in your circuit. You use multimeter tests to
narrow down the field of suspects until you find the culprit causing all
your headaches.
Checking out the resistance movement
You almost always test resistance (measured in ohms, as we talk about in
Chapter 1) with the circuit unpowered. Resistance tests may involve an entire
circuit or just an individual component. You can check up on wires, resistors,
motors, and many other kinds of electronic doodads.
179
Chapter 9: Making Friends with Your Multimeter
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Resistance, or the absence of it, can reveal short circuits and open circuits;
so-called continuity of electrical components. When you perform these tests,
a shorted circuit shows zero (or virtually zero) resistance and an open circuit
shows infinite resistance. You can use continuity tests to check for breaks in
wires.
180
Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
Beep beep goes the continuity test
A feature found on many multimeters, like the
one shown here, is audible continuity testing. To
use this feature, you turn the meter’s control dial
(more about dial turning in the section “Making
sense of all the inputs and dials”) to Continuity
or Tone
You may find this feature handy when you check
the wiring of a circuit. If a wire or connection
has continuity (a shorted circuit), the meter
beeps. If the wire or connection doesn’t have
continuity (an open circuit), the meter stays
silent. The audible tone gives you a handy way
to check a whole circuit without having to keep
your eye on the multimeter. Most meters made
these days have this feature, and we recom-
mend it.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Here are some other tests you can perform with a multimeter that rely on
resistance:
 Fuses: A blown fuse shows an open circuit.
 Switches: Flipping the switch should alternate the multimeter’s reading
between zero (shorted) and infinite (open) resistance.
 Circuit board traces: A bad copper trace on a printed circuit board acts
like a broken wire and shows up as infinite ohms (open circuit) on the
multimeter.
 Solder joints: A bad joint may read as an open circuit on the multimeter,
showing infinite resistance.
Making sense of all the inputs and dials
Check out Figure 9-3 to see the main points of interest on the typical multime-
ter. Here’s what they all mean:
 Meter face or digital readout: Analog multimeters have a meter face
consisting of a set of graduated scales and a precision needle indicator.
A digital multimeter has a numeric readout.
 Function knob: Dial the knob to the test that you want to perform:
Voltage, Current, Resistance, or whatever. On meters without an auto-
ranging feature, you also typically use the function knob to set the maxi-
mum range of the value that you want to test. If you set the maximum
range to be just higher than the value you are testing — whether volt-
age, resistance, current, or whatever — you are assured of the most
accurate reading possible. If your meter does have an auto-ranging fea-
ture, it will automatically adjust itself to give you the most accurate
reading. 
 Test lead inputs: At a minimum, the multimeter has a + (positive) and –
(negative or common) lead input. You insert the test leads into these
inputs. Some meters have additional inputs for high current testing (usu-
ally marked A, for amperage) and special sockets for testing transistors
and capacitors, as you can see in Figure 9-4. Note: Many small, pocket
multimeters have the leads permanently attached.
 Zero-set control: On analog meters without an automatic zero feature,
designers provide a rotating knob so you can adjust the needle to 0
(zero) ohms before use. Some digital meters have a button that, when
you press it, sets the meter to zero.

Accuracy, resolution, and sensitivity
The accuracy of a multimeter represents the maximum amount of error that
occurs when it takes a measurement. For example, the multimeter may be
accurate to 2,000 volts, ±0.8 percent. A 0.8-percent error with the types of volt-
ages used in DC-operated circuits — typically 5 to 12 volts DC — measures only
about 0.096 volts. For hobby electronics projects, you don’t need a more pre-
cise level of accuracy. As you compare the accuracy of multimeters, bear in
mind that just about every model of meter gives the hobbyist the results that
he or she needs.
Digital meters have another type of rating, this one more commonly called res-
olution. The number of digits in the display determines the smallest change
that the meter can register. Most digital meters designed for hobbyists have 31⁄2
digits, so they can display a value as small as 0.001 (the half digit appears as a 1
on the far left of the display). The hobbyist’s meter can’t accurately represent
anything less than 0.001. For most hobby-level electronics projects, you don’t
need to worry about this.
Resolution in digital multimeters is also a function of analog-to-digital con-
verter (ADC) electronics. An ADC converts an analog signal to a digital one.
Many consumer-grade multimeters use a 12-bit ADC. Without getting into all
the technical mumbo-jumbo, a 12-bit ADC can take any analog signal and con-
vert it into 4,096 discrete steps. (These discrete steps are necessary because of
the way digital circuits work. In the digital world there can’t be any in-between
or “sort of” values.) Meter manufacturers select an ADC with a resolution that
works with the number of display digits on the device. A 31⁄2 digit digital readout
displays the values of a 12-bit ADC just about right.
Along the lines of accuracy and resolution, you need to consider the specifica-
tion for sensitivity. This phrase means the smallest value that a meter can
meaningfully detect when you use it under normal conditions. 
 Quality digital multimeters sport a maximum sensitivity of about 1 micro-
volt (AC or DC); that’s one millionth of a volt. The lower the value, the
better the sensitivity.
 Quality analog multimeters offer a maximum sensitivity of about 20,000
ohms per volt, typically shown as 20KΩ/V. The higher the ohms value,
the better the sensitivity.
The well-stocked multimeter
The typical multimeter doesn’t come with a lot of accessories, but you need
to have a few. We cover the necessities in the following sections.
183
Chapter 9: Making Friends with Your Multimeter
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Manual
The manual for your multimeter may be just a single sheet of paper with little
more than a picture, or you may get a small booklet with step-by-step instruc-
tions. Either way, be sure to at least browse through the manual. It contains
important safety precautions, as well as a run-down of features and specifica-
tions for that meter model.
Test leads
The test leads included with most inexpensive multimeters aren’t of the high-
est quality, so you may want to purchase a better set. You may want to get
the type with coiled leads because they stretch out to several feet, yet recoil
to a manageable length when not in use. Figure 9-5 shows some examples of
coiled leads.
Standard leads with their pointed metal probes work fine for most routine
testing, but some measurements may require the use of a clip lead. These
leads have a spring-loaded clip on the end; you can clip the lead in place so
that your hands are free to do other things. The clips are insulated to prevent
touching the metal against another part of the circuit.
If your multimeter doesn’t come with clip leads, you can buy some clip-on
attachments that fit over regular test leads.

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Extra fuse
Most multimeters use an internal fuse to protect themselves against excessive
voltage or current. The better multimeters come with a spare fuse. If yours
doesn’t have a spare, purchase one when you buy the meter. That way, you
have it available when you need it.
Some meter fuses are specially made, and replacements can cost you a bundle.
You may want to check the price of replacement fuses before you purchase the
meter!
Batteries
Except for really old analog models that only test voltage or current, all multi-
meters come equipped with a battery of one type or another. The most con-
venient multimeters use a standard-size battery, such as a 9-volt or AA cell.
Pocket meters typically use a coin-type battery. If your local supermarket or
drugstore doesn’t carry replacement batteries for your meter, try Radio Shack
or a photographic supply store.
The batteries in multimeters tend to last a long, long time — that is, unless
you forget to turn the meter off after using it. The batteries in multimeters
can often last a year or longer under typical use. But eventually the battery
dies, so be sure to keep a spare battery handy. We prefer alkaline batteries
over standard-duty zinc cells, as they last longer.
If your multimeter uses a specialty battery, consider storing the spare in its
original packaging in your refrigerator. It lasts longer that way. Take it out of
the refrigerator a day before you plan to use it. That allows the battery to
slowly come up to room temperature.
Nickel-cadmium and nickel metal hydride rechargeable batteries put out a
slightly lower voltage than alkaline batteries of the same size. Most multi-
meters don’t have a problem with this lower voltage. However, some meters
may stop working or may give erratic or erroneous results when powered by
a rechargeable battery. Check the manual that comes with your multimeter 
to be sure that your meter can handle rechargeable batteries.
Maximum range: Just
how much is enough?
There’s a limit to what a multimeter can test. You call that limit its maximum
range. These days, most consumer multimeters have more-or-less the same
maximum range for voltage, current, and resistance. Any meter that has the
following maximum ratings (or better) should work just fine for your hobby
electronics:
185
Chapter 9: Making Friends with Your Multimeter
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

DC volts: 1000 V
AC volts: 500 V
DC current: 200 mA (milliamperes)
Resistance: 2 MΩ(two megohms, or 2 million ohms)
Home on the automatic range
Most analog multimeters, and many digital ones, require that you select the
range (see Figure 9-6) before the meter can make an accurate measurement.
For example, if you’re measuring the voltage of a 9-volt transistor battery, you
set the range to the setting closest to, and above, 9 volts. For most meters, this
means you select the 20 or 50 volt range. You then read the voltage on the
meter.
Be sure to read the result from the proper meter scale. If you select the 20-
volt range, for example, you must use the 20-volt scale. Otherwise, you end
up with inaccurate results.
You shouldn’t find manually setting the range of your meter complicated, and
the extra effort can’t kill you. But these days, automatic ranging, especially
for digital multimeters, is all the rage. So-called auto ranging meters don’t
require you to first set the test range. This feature makes them inherently
easier to use and a little less prone to error. When you want to measure volt-
age, you set the meter function to Volts (either AC or DC) and take the mea-
surement. The meter displays the results in the readout panel. Meters with
an automatic ranging feature, like the one in Figure 9-7, don’t require a sepa-
rate range knob.
186
Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
What if you need to test higher currents?
Most digital multimeters can measure current
only less than one amp. The typical digital mul-
timeter has a maximum range of 200 milli-
amperes. Attempting to measure substantially
higher currents may cause the fuse in the meter
to blow. Many analog meters, especially older
models, support current readings of 5 or 10
amps, maximum.
You may find analog meters with a high ampere
input handy if you’re testing motors and circuits
that draw a lot of current. If you have only a dig-
ital meter with a limited milliampere input, you
can still measure higher currents indirectly by
using a low-resistance, high wattage resistor.
You can read more about this kind of resistor in
Chapter 7.

Whether analog or digital, the meter indicates an over range if the voltage or
other measurement is too high for the meter to display. A digital multimeter
typically shows over range as a flashing 1 (or OL). An analog meter shows
over range as the needle going off the scale. If the meter is auto-ranging, and
you see the over range indicator, it means that the value is too high to be
measured by the meter. Such an over range indication is common when test-
ing continuity. It simply means the resistance is so high that that meter
cannot register it, even at its highest range setting.
When using an analog multimeter, avoid over range conditions because these
conditions can damage the precision needle movement. For this reason, always
dial in the highest scale that you believe you need when using an analog
meter and then work your way down. This approach avoids the needle slam-
ming against its stops (the upper limit reading) in an over range.
Extra nice-to-have functions
As we discuss in the section “The Basics of Multimeters,” earlier in this chap-
ter, all standard multimeters let you measure AC volts, DC volts, current, and
resistance. Beyond these functions, digital multimeters vary in the number
and type of functions that they provide. Here are some extra functions that
can make the testing process a little easier and a bit more accurate:
 Test the operation and value of capacitors. Because test leads can influ-
ence capacitance readings, most multimeters with a capacitor-testing
feature provide separate input sockets. Plug the capacitor into these
sockets and take the reading.
 Test whether or not a diode is operational. Digital meters with this fea-
ture have a special Diode test setting. Note that most analog meters can
also test the proper operation of diodes using a low resistance scale. See
the section titled “Testing diodes,” later in this chapter, for details on
how to do this test.
 Test whether or not a transistor is operational. Both analog and digital
multimeters can perform simple testing of bipolar transistors. When
using an analog meter, you can usually test the transistor in the same
way that you test a diode. When using a digital meter, you test the tran-
sistor by using specially marked transistor input sockets.
 Auto-zero a multimeter’s reading. For digital multimeters only, the meter
automatically sets a proper zero point before taking a measurement. For
analog multimeters, and some digital models, you have to first set the
meter to zero. Your meter’s manual outlines the precise method that you
need to use.

Setting Up the Meter
Before using your meter, you must make sure that it’s working properly. Any
malfunction gives you incorrect testing results, and you may not even realize it.
Modern meters, especially the digital kind, require batteries. Check and replace
the batteries as needed. If your meter comes with a low battery indicator or
light, note when it activates and replace the meter’s battery (or batteries) right
away. Use only fresh alkaline batteries. Most meters aren’t designed to run
from rechargeable nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries, which deliver slightly
lower voltage than their alkaline counterparts. Unless the instruction manual
indicates otherwise, don’t use NiCads to power your meter.
To test your multimeter, follow these steps:
1. Turn on the meter and dial it to the Ohms (Ω) setting.
If the meter isn’t auto-ranging, set it to low ohms.
2. Plug both test probes into the proper connectors of the meter and then
touch the ends of the two probes together, as Figure 9-8 shows you.
3. The meter should read 0 (zero) ohms or very close to it.
If your meter doesn’t have an auto-zero feature, press the Adjust (or Zero
Adjust) button. On analog meters, rotate the Zero Adjust knob until the
needle reads 0 (zero). Keep the test probes in contact and wait a second or
two for the meter to set itself to zero.
Here are some important points to keep in mind when you’re testing a 
multimeter:

 Avoid touching the ends of the metal test probes with your fingers while
you’re performing the test. The natural resistance of your body can
throw off the accuracy of the meter.
 Check to be sure that the test probes at the end of the test leads are
clean. Dirty or corroded test probes can cause inaccurate results. Clean
the probes with electronic contact cleaner, available at Radio Shack.
Clean both ends of the test probes and, if necessary, the connectors on
the meter.
 Double-check the dial setting of the meter. Make sure that you have it set
to Ohms. If you don’t have an auto ranging multimeter, set the range dial
to the lowest Ohms setting.
You can consider the meter calibrated when it reads zero ohms with the test
probes shorted together (held together so that they’re touching each other).
Do this test each time you use your meter, especially if you turn off the meter
between tests.

Testing the resistance of good ol’ water
You can use your multimeter for a simple sci-
ence experiment that not only demonstrates the
process of measuring resistance, but also how
much crud your drinking water contains. (Yuck!)
Here’s how:
1. Get two clean glasses.
2. Rinse out both glasses with distilled water.
You can get distilled water at the 
supermarket.
3. Fill one glass with the distilled water and
the other glass with tap water.
4. Set up your multimeter to measure 
resistance.
If your multimeter doesn’t have auto rang-
ing, set it to a fairly high range such as 200K
ohms or higher.
5. Strap the two test probes together at their
insulating handles, using a rubber band.
Be sure that the metal parts of the probes
don’t touch.
6. Dip the probes into the glass of distilled
water. Note the reading and set the range
downward, if you don’t get a good reading.
7. Now dip the probes into the glass of tap
water. Again, note the reading.
In grade school, you may have learned that
water conducts electricity. Actually, that state-
ment isn’t entirely correct. Pure water is an
insulator; the minerals in the water conduct
electricity. Distilled water has little mineral con-
tent, so it has a very high resistance. Depending
on where you live, your tap water may contain a
lot of salts and minerals, and these additions
make the water more conductive. These impu-
rities lead to water with a lower resistance that
therefore better conducts electricity.
My own tests show that distilled water has a
resistance of about 140KΩ; the tap water’s
resistance came out at about 40KΩ. Your own
tests may give you higher or lower measure-
ments for both kinds of water because of the
differences in water quality and the distance
between the probes.

As we talk about in the section “Okay, So What Exactly Can You Do with a
Multimeter?” earlier in this chapter, many digital meters have a continuity
feature that sounds a tone when the circuit you’re testing reaches zero ohms.
However, don’t use the continuity setting for zero-adjusting the meter. The
tone may sound when the meter reads a few ohms, so it doesn’t give you the
accuracy that you need. Recalibrate the multimeter using the Ohms setting,
and not the Continuity setting, to ensure proper operation.
If you don’t get any response at all from the meter when you touch the test
probes together, recheck the dial setting of the meter. Nothing happens if you
have the meter set to register AC or DC voltage or current. If you make sure
that the meter has the right settings and it still doesn’t respond, you may
have faulty test leads. If necessary, repair or replace any bad test leads with 
a new set.
After you check the meter out, you can select the desired function (ohms, AC,
DC, or current) and range and apply the probes to the circuit under test.
Five Basic Tests That You Can 
Make with Your Multimeter
Okay, get your meter turned on and all set up, and you’re ready to make some
tests. In the following sections, you learn how to conduct five of the most
common tests using a multimeter.
Testing voltage
Is your circuit getting the proper voltage? You can find out with your multi-
meter. You conduct voltage tests with the circuit under power. You can test the
voltage at almost any point in a circuit, not just the battery connections. The
procedure is simple and involves connecting the black test lead to ground, and
the red test lead to a test point in the circuit that you want to check. 
To perform this test
1. Set up the meter as described in the earlier section “Setting Up the
Meter.”
2. Attach the black lead of the meter to the ground connection of the 
circuit.
3. Attach the red lead of the meter to the point in the circuit that you
want to measure.

Figure 9-9 shows an example of a multimeter testing a couple of points in a
simple 555 integrated circuit (IC) timer. The top image shows the meter mea-
suring the voltage that powers the entire circuit, and the bottom image shows
the meter measuring the voltage at the output of the 555 IC. Because the
output of the 555 IC is an on-or-off voltage, the reading on the multimeter
alternates between zero volts and five volts.
Signals generated by circuits may change so rapidly that you can’t adequately
test them by using a multimeter. The multimeter can’t react to the change in
voltage fast enough. The proper gear for testing fast-changing signals are the
logic probe and the oscilloscope. You can read about both tools in more detail
in Chapter 10.

Testing current
As with voltage tests, you make current tests using a multimeter while you
have the circuit under power. To take the basic approach, you need to connect
the meter in the circuit in series with the positive supply voltage so that the
meter registers the current passing through the circuit. This measurement tells
you how much overall current the entire circuit draws. But remember that
many digital meters are limited to testing current draw of 200 milliamps or less.
Be careful: don’t test higher current if your meter isn’t equipped to do so.
You can also test current that flows through a portion of the circuit, or you
can even test a single component. Figure 9-10 shows how to test the current
through an LED. Make this test with the meter dialed to the Milliamperes 
setting.
All current measurements use this setup. You insert the meter in series with
the circuit, as you can see in Figure 9-10. Connect the black lead either to
ground, if testing the current draw of the entire circuit, or to the more nega-
tive side of the circuit. If you find that you get no reading at all, reverse the
connections of the leads to the multimeter and try again.
After making a current test, return the meter dial to Off. This habit helps pre-
vent damage to the meter.

Testing wires and cables for continuity
Continuity tests whether a circuit is complete or not. We can describe conti-
nuity most clearly using a wire as the circuit:
 A short circuit shows that your circuit has continuity between two points
of the same wire. The meter shows this state as 0 (zero) ohms.
 An open circuit means that your circuit doesn’t have continuity. There is
a break somewhere inside the wire in the circuit. The meter shows this
situation as infinite ohms, which means so many ohms that the meter
can’t register them.
When testing a cable with many wires, you also want to determine if any of
the individual wires are touching each other. When this situation happens,
the wires short out. If a short happens, your circuit fails, so you want to make
this test every time things go wrong. 
Follow the diagram in Figure 9-11 for testing a wire by using these procedures:
 Test for continuity in a single wire. Connect the multimeter probes to
either end of the wire. You should get a reading of 0 (zero) ohms, or very
low ohms. A reading of more than just a few ohms indicates a possible
open circuit.
 Test for a short between different wires that shouldn’t be electrically
connected. Connect the multimeter probes to any exposed conductor of
the two wires. You should get a reading other than zero ohms. If the read-
ing shows zero or very low ohms, it indicates a possible short circuit.
194
Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
Don’t blow your fuse!
Remember that hooking up a circuit or compo-
nent that draws more current than your multi-
meter is rated to handle can lead to big
problems. You run the risk of blowing the fuse in
the meter, and then you have to replace the fuse
before you can use the multimeter again.
Many analog and digital meters provide a sepa-
rate input for testing current. If your multimeter
has this input, it’s usually marked as A (for amps)
or mA (for milliamps). Be sure to use this input
when testing current. Some multimeters have a
separate input for testing higher currents, typi-
cally up to 10 amps. Typically, this input is marked
as 10A.
Be sure to select the proper input before making
any current measurement. Forgetting to do this
step may either damage your meter (if you’re
unlucky) or blow a fuse (if you’re lucky).

If you’re testing two different wires that shouldn’t be electrically connected 
in a circuit, you get a reading on the multimeter of infinite ohms, showing an
open circuit, right? Most of the time that statement is true. But it’s not always
the case. Here’s the reason: Even though the wires may not be directly joined,
they’re both connected to the circuit. This connection, whatever it is, may
show a certain resistance when tested on the multimeter. So when you’re
looking for shorts across wires, don’t be too worried if you get a reading
other than infinite ohms.
Testing switches
Mechanical switches can get dirty and worn, and they can sometimes just
plain break. When your switch becomes a bit worse for wear, it may no longer
pass electrical current when you want it to.
Testing a wide variety of switches
Follow the diagram in Figure 9-12 to test a switch. As we discuss in Chapter 5,
the most basic switch is the single-pole, single-throw, or SPST. You can readily
identify such a switch by its two terminals: One acts as an inlet for the electri-
cal current coming into the unit, and the other acts as an outlet. The switch
passes or interrupts the current, depending on its position.
You call an SPST switch “single-pole” because it switches only a single part of
the circuit. You use “single-throw” to describe the switch because it has only
a single variation in its operating positions, on or off.
Some switches are double-pole, double-throw, or both. In a double-pole switch,
the switch controls two separate circuits (say, one 12 VDC circuit and one 5
VDC circuit). In a double-throw switch, the switch may be the on-on type, or it
may have a center off position, as in on-off-on. Figure 9-13 shows some varia-
tions in switch designs that you may test. Other switches may have additional
poles and even three, four, or five positions, but these switches usually just

Even wire resists the flow of electrons
Why don’t you always get zero ohms when test-
ing wire, especially a long wire? All electrical cir-
cuits have a resistance to the flow of current; the
ohms measurement tests this resistance. Even
short lengths of wire have a resistance, but it’s
usually well less than 1 ohm and so not an impor-
tant test subject for continuity or shorts.
However, the longer the wire, the more the
resistance, especially if the wire has a small
diameter. Usually, the larger the wire, the lower
its resistance per foot. Even though the meter
doesn’t read exactly zero ohms, you can assume
proper continuity in this instance if you get a low
ohms reading.

come as variations on the theme (and switches with additional poles aren’t
common). So we don’t spend extra time on them in this book. 
In Chapter 5 we talk about switches and their variations in more detail.
Follow the procedures in Table 9-1 when testing various types of switches.
The physical location and function of the terminals on each switch may differ.
Often, in a double-pole switch, the center terminal serves as a common; you
turn the switch one way to route the current to the left terminal and turn the
switch the other way to route the current to the right terminal. However, not
all switches are designed this way, and only your own experimentation will
help you identify the differences.

Some words to the wise
When testing the various types of switches, use the following tips to help you:
 With the switch in the off position, the meter should show no continuity
(infinite ohms). You’ll encounter this reading with both poles in a double-
pole switch.
 With the switch in the on position, the meter should show continuity
(zero ohms). If the meter doesn’t show continuity when you place the
switch in the on position, you have a fairly good indication that you’re
working with a bad switch.
You can most easily test switches when you work with them out of a circuit. If
you have the switch wired in a circuit, the meter may not show infinite ohms
when you place the switch in the off position. Instead, you may get a reading
of some value other than 0 (zero) ohms. (To understand why, read the side-
bar “Even wire resists the flow of electrons,” earlier in this chapter.)
If you have a double-throw variety of switch, you may not have an off position.
Instead, the switch has two on positions. You can test this type of switch as if
it were two single-throw switches combined by making two tests rather than
just one. If the switch has a center-off position, you should get a no-continuity
reading for only the center position.
Testing fuses
If a circuit begins to draw too much current, it can get very hot, not only
destroying itself in the process, but also possibly causing a fire. Fuses are
designed to protect electronic circuitry from damage caused by excessive
current flow and, more importantly, to prevent a fire if a circuit overheats. 
A fuse is designed to blow (or become an open circuit) when the current
going through it exceeds the safe level for that fuse.
Fuses blow for reasons other than a circuit going haywire. Sometimes, they
blow because of some intermittent problem, like a momentary rise (called a
spike) in voltage from a distant (or not-so-distant!) lightning strike. When fuses
blow, you need to replace them with a fuse of the same rating. You can find
the fuse rating printed on the component.
To test a fuse, dial the meter to either Ohms or Continuity. Touch each end 
of the fuse with the meter probes, as Figure 9-14 shows. The meter should
read 0 (zero) ohms. If the meter reads infinite ohms (beyond what the meter
can read) it means you have a burned-out fuse and you need to replace it.

Testing Resistors, Capacitors, and 
Other Electronic Components
The following sections talk about the nitty-gritty reason for using a multimeter:
Testing resistors, capacitors, and the other main components of a circuit.
To get more detailed information on what resistors, capacitors, and other
parts that we discuss in the following sections do, see Chapter 4.
Gee, it looks all burned out!
Because the goal of testing is to determine if you have a good component to
begin with, start by making first judgments based on the overall appearance
of the component. In some cases, a part may be so obviously destroyed that
any more testing wastes your time. You have a good sign that you’re dealing
with a bad electronic component when it looks burned out. If an electronic
component overheats, usually as a result of soaking up too much current, it
can melt or erupt. It sometimes even catches on fire! When you find a burned-
out component, you need to consider why the component burned out so that
you can prevent it from happening again.
Here’s what you need to look for to spot damaged components:
 On a resistor, see if it has an obviously bulging center, with or without a
distinct discoloration.
 On a capacitor, check for a bulge on the top or sides, with or without
gooey electrolyte material seeping out. Don’t worry what this gunk looks
like: anything coming out of a capacitor is bad news.

 On a diode, transistor, or integrated circuit, look for any obvious dis-
colorations on the circuit board caused by extreme overheating of the
component.
 Don’t overlook any component that you find in two or more pieces!
(Okay . . . duh . . .)
Avoid contact with the syrupy liquid inside an electrolytic capacitor. It’s caus-
tic, which means it can burn you. Wash your hands immediately with warm
water and soap if you do touch this liquid. Don’t get any in your eyes! If you
do, flush your eyes out right away and seek immediate medical attention.
Of course, looks alone can be deceiving. Your component may have internal
damage, even if you don’t see visual signs of burn-out. Therefore, use a visual
examination only to find obvious faults and not as a way to ultimately deter-
mine if your component has a problem. Don’t assume that because every-
thing looks okay on the outside that the component doesn’t have an internal
problem.
Testing resistors
Resistors are the components that limit current through a circuit or divide
voltages in a circuit. Resistors come in a lot of values; you can find the value
marked on the body of the resistor. Sometimes, you need to verify that the
markings are accurate or that the resistor hasn’t gone bad.
You can readily test resistors with a multimeter by following these steps:
1. Set the multimeter to read ohms.
If you don’t have an auto-ranging meter, start at a high range and work
down.
2. Position the test probes on either end of the resistor.
Be sure that your fingers don’t touch the test probes or the leads of the
resistor; if you do, you add the natural resistance of your own body into
the reading, giving you an inaccurate result.
3. Take the reading.
A bad resistor can be either completely open inside, in which case you may
get a reading of infinite ohms, or it can be shorted out, in which case you get
a reading of zero ohms.
When testing a resistor, check its marked value against the reading provided
by the meter. The reading should fall within the tolerance range of the resis-
tor. For example:
201
Chapter 9: Making Friends with Your Multimeter
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 If the resistor has a tolerance of 10 percent and is marked as 1K ohms,
acceptable test readings fall in the range of 900 to 1,000 ohms. Tolerance
is 10 percent of 1,000, or 100 ohms.
 If the resistor has a tolerance of one percent (you call these low-tolerance
resistors precision resistors), acceptable test readings fall in the range of
990 to 1,010 ohms. Tolerance is one percent of 1,000, or 10 ohms.
Testing potentiometers
A potentiometer is a variable resistor. Like a resistor, you can test potentio-
meters (also called “pots”) with your multimeter. As you can see in Figure
9-15, you can connect the meter to either end of the conductive material.
With the multimeter applied to points 1 and 2, turning the dial shaft in one
direction increases resistance. But with the meter applied to points 2 and 3,
turning the dial in the other direction decreases resistance.
The material used for the conductive surface of the pot can take many forms,
including cermet (a combination of ceramic, glass, and precious metals),
carbon, wire, and conductive plastic. This conductive surface can break off, get
dirty, or burn out. A pot sometimes goes bad because something damages
the surface. As you turn the shaft of the potentiometer, use your multimeter
to make note of any sudden changes in resistance, which may indicate an inter-
nal fault. If you find such a fault, you should replace the pot with a new one.
Testing diodes
A diode is the simplest form of semi-conductor. Diodes perform a lot of odd
jobs in electronics circuits, including changing AC current to DC, blocking

voltages, limiting voltage, and lighting up your life. You can test whether or
not the diode functions correctly if you have a digital multimeter that has a
diode-check setting.
To test a diode using a multimeter with a diode-check feature, perform these
steps:
1. Dial the meter to the diode-check setting.
2. Apply the test probes of the meter to the diode.
Observe proper polarity: Attach the red test lead to the anode (negative
terminal) of the diode, and the black test lead to the cathode (the posi-
tive terminal; the cathode has a stripe so that you can identify it).
Remember to avoid touching the test probes with your fingers.
3. Observe the reading.
4. Reverse the probes and test again.
Table 9-2 shows you how to interpret your test results. Although this test
works for most diode types, it doesn’t give a proper reading for light-emitting
diodes. But you can often test light-emitting diodes visually.

Diode testing with an analog meter
If you have an analog multimeter, you can test
most types of diodes by using the resistance
setting and following these steps:
1. Set the meter to a low-value resistance
range.
2. Connect the black lead to the cathode
(striped end) and the red lead to the anode.
The multimeter should display a low 
resistance.
3. Reverse the leads.
The multimeter should display infinite 
resistance.

Testing capacitors
You use capacitors to store electrons for a short period of time. Capacitors
can die an early death for a number of reasons, so use your multimeter to
find out which ones you need to bury because of
 Old age: Certain types of capacitors, mainly those with a liquid elec-
trolytic, can dry out over time. When they’re dry, they stop working.
 Too much voltage: All capacitors are rated for a specific working voltage;
apply voltage beyond what the capacitor is rated for and you can damage
the capacitor.
 Reversed polarity: A polarized capacitor, which has a + or – sign marked
on it, can literally blow apart if you connect it to the circuit backward.
You can check a capacitor using a multimeter that doesn’t have a special
capacitor-testing feature. You don’t always get conclusive results, but the
results you do get can help point the way to whether you should replace a
component. Follow these steps to test without a capacitor-testing feature:
1. Before testing, use an insulated bleeder jumper (see Figure 9-16) to
short out the terminals of the capacitor. You can make this jumper
yourself. A bleeder jumper is simply a wire with a 1 or 2 megohm
resistor attached. The resistor prevents the capacitor from being
shorted out, which makes it unusable.
This step discharges the capacitor. You need to short out the terminals
because large capacitors can retain a charge for long periods of time,
even after you remove power.
2. Dial the meter to Ohms.
3. Touch the meter probes to the terminals of the capacitor. Wait a
second or two and then note the reading.

A good capacitor shows a reading of infinity when you perform this step.
A reading of 0 (zero) may mean that the capacitor has shorted out. A
leaky capacitor, one that is losing its ability to hold its charge, gives an
ohms reading somewhere between infinity and zero.
If you are working with a polarized capacitor, connect the black lead to the 
– (negative) terminal of the capacitor and the red lead to the + (positive) 
terminal. For unpolarized capacitors, it doesn’t matter how you connect the
leads.
This test doesn’t tell you if the capacitor is open, which can happen if the
component becomes structurally damaged inside or if its dielectric (insulat-
ing material) dries out or leaks. An open capacitor will read infinite ohms. 
For a conclusive test, use a multimeter with a capacitor-testing function.
If your multimeter has a capacitor-testing feature, by all means use it rather
than the method that we give you here. Refer to the manual that came with
your meter for the exact procedure because the specifics vary from model to
model. Be sure to observe proper polarity when connecting the capacitor to
the test points on the meter.
You get another advantage by using a multimeter with a capacitor testing fea-
ture because the meter displays the value of the capacitor. You may find this
measurement handy if you need to determine whether a capacitor falls within
the tolerance range for your circuit. This feature also helps to verify the value
markings on the component because not all capacitors follow the industry
standard identification schemes.
Testing transistors
You can use a digital or analog multimeter to test most bipolar transistors.
The test doesn’t give you conclusive results, but it does provide a useful
method of finding out if you have a defective transistor.
Bipolar transistors are essentially two diodes in one package, as you can see in
Figure 9-17. You can therefore test the transistor by using the same methodol-
ogy that we describe in the section “Testing diodes,” earlier in this chapter.
Follow these steps (which assume that your multimeter has a diode-check
feature) to determine if the component is good or bad:
1. Set the meter to the diode-check setting.
2. Connect the red and black leads to the terminals of the transistor.
3. Take the reading and note the result. Refer to Table 9-3 for the results
you should look for when testing a good transistor.

Testing with a multimeter can permanently damage some types of transistors,

sistors only. Data books show these types of transistors with terminals
marked as base, emitter, and collector. Schematic diagrams show the bipolar
PNP and NPN resistors with either of the symbols shown here. If you’re not
sure whether you have a bipolar transistor, look it up in a data sheet before
testing. You can find data sheets on the Internet by doing a Google or Yahoo
search for the component you’re interested in. Try searching by: “2n2222
datasheet”.
If your multimeter is equipped with a transistor-checking feature, use that
feature rather than the method that we give you here. Consult the manual

one model to another.

don’t rush out and buy them this afternoon. But if you start working on inter-
mediate and advanced electronics, you may find these guys handy. Consider
adding these tools to your workbench after you gain a bit of experience.
The Search for Spock: 
Using a Logic Probe
You use a logic probe (a fairly inexpensive tool), like the one in Figure 10-1, to
test digital circuits. Specifically, the probe can tell you whether a signal is high
or low. In digital electronics, zero volts, or very close to it, is a low signal. Any
voltage other than zero means that you have a high signal. When you generate
a signal that alternates between high and low very quickly you call it pulsing.
Logic probes are great at detecting pulsing.

With few exceptions, logic circuits operate at 12 volts or less, with 5 volts as
the most common. The components in the circuit define the voltage. 
As you work with a logic probe keep the following “logical” tidbits in mind:
 You may see a low signal indicated by a logical 0 (zero) and a high signal
indicated by a logical 1 (one). Just about every digital circuit or computer
only allows the two states of 0 and 1.
 The term “logic” comes from how you combine these two states, 0 and 1,
to create useful information. For example, an AND logic gate analyzes
two input signals. The output of the AND gate is 1 (high) if, and only if,
both inputs are 1. There are various other logic gates, including NAND,
OR, NOR, and XOR. We introduce the most common of these logic gates
in Chapter 1 and provide more detail in Chapter 5.
Sound, lights, action!
Although you can use a multimeter to test a digital circuit, you can use a logic
probe a lot more easily. With a meter, you have to keep an eye on the readout
and determine if the reading indicates low or high voltage.
With the typical logic probe, one light glows when the circuit is low and
another light glows when the circuit is high (see Figure 10-2). Most logic

probes also include a tone feature. The tone toggles between two states to
indicate low or high. You don’t have to take your eyes off the circuit; just
listen to the probe as it sings to you!
Logic probes also let you know when the circuit has no signal at all, either
low or high. If the circuit has no signal, then neither probe light glows and the
probe doesn’t make a sound. (However, this lack of response from the probe
doesn’t always mean that you have a bad circuit, as we talk about in the sec-
tion “What if the indicator doesn’t indicate?”). With a multimeter, the lack of
any signal may appear as zero volts (indicating a possible low). This differ-
ence makes a logic probe the better tool for testing digital circuits.
Logic probes also help you solve the problem of poor connections. If you
have a loose wire, for example, the audible tone from the probe breaks up or
crackles. You get this kind of response from the probe because it can’t get a
steady, reliable signal. When you hear a weak or unsteady tone, fix the con-
nection and try it again.
Signals that are too fast 
(even for Superman)
Being versatile little gadgets, most logic probes can also identify a circuit
where the signal is rapidly changing. This rapid signal change happens quite
often in digital circuits. Figure 10-3 shows an illustration of such a changing
signal, called a square wave. This digital signal changes, or pulses, between
low and high. How fast it changes depends on the circuit. In some circuits, a
signal changes millions of times per second.

Although the logic probe can’t tell you how fast a signal is pulsing, for most
tests you simply need to know whether the signal is pulsing at all. If you
expect the signal to be pulsing, but it isn’t, then you know you have a prob-
lem somewhere.
When you do need to determine the rate of pulsing, or even what the signal
waveform looks like, use an oscilloscope, which you can read about in more
detail in the section “Scoping Out the Oscilloscope,” later in this chapter. The
logic probe is a simple tool to use, and it’s great for the kinds of jobs that it’s
designed for. But in-depth digital analysis isn’t one of them.

Why don’t all circuits like logic probes?
Believe it or not, some electronic circuits don’t
like certain pieces of test equipment. Most test
gear, including the multimeter and oscilloscope,
draws very little current from the circuit that
you’re testing. Their makers design these test-
ing tools this way so that the tools themselves
don’t influence the reading. Obviously, it does no
good to test a circuit if the testing tool changes
the behavior of that circuit. You can’t get a reli-
able result.
Logic probes not only draw power from the cir-
cuit, they can load down the signal line that
you’re testing. Some digital signals are fairly
weak. The additional load of the logic probe may
cause the signal to drop in voltage to a point
where you can’t get an accurate reading.
Although this situation doesn’t come up all that
often, it’s a good example of why you need to be
somewhat familiar with the circuit that you’re
testing. Just know that poking the probe into
unknown territory may yield unpredictable
results.
Be sure to read the manual or instruction book-
let that comes with your logic probe for addi-
tional pointers, cautions, caveats, warnings,
and operating tips. Though many logic probes
are similar in design, slight differences can
influence the types of circuits that a particular
probe best works with.

Know thy circuit
To get the most use out of a logic probe, you need a wiring diagram, schematic,
or service notes for the circuit that you’re testing. This information helps you
better determine the source when you discover problems.
You also need to have some documentation for the circuit handy because
you have to be careful about where you put the logic probe. A logic probe
receives its power from the circuit that you’re testing. To use the probe, you
must first connect its power leads to the positive and ground connections of
the circuit that you’re troubleshooting. You’re not supposed to operate most
logic probes at more than 15 volts, so you have to know where to tap into the
circuit for the power. If you connect the probe to a spot with a high voltage,
you run the risk of permanently damaging the probe, the circuit you’re test-
ing, or both. If you don’t know the voltage level of a particular circuit, first test it
with a multimeter.
Putting the Logic Probe to Work
No doubt, you’re dying to see the logic probe in action. In the following sec-
tions, we run down some safety issues that you need to be aware of before
you start, take you through the steps of using a logic probe to test a circuit,
and tell you just what the readings you get from the probe may mean.
Observe the usual safety 
precautions, please
The same safety precautions that you use with a multimeter apply when you
use a logic probe, only more so. We won’t repeat those precautions here, but
you should take a quick look at Chapter 9 before you actually start using a
logic probe. 
Safety is even more important with a logic probe than with a multimeter
because the logic probe is an active-circuit tester. You have to turn the circuit
on in order to test it. This requirement is not always true of the multimeter,
with which you can conduct certain tests, such as continuity (testing whether
a circuit is complete), without applying any power to the circuit.
211
Chapter 10: Getting Down with Logic Probes and Oscilloscopes
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Take special care if the circuit that you’re testing runs off AC power and you
need to expose the power supply components to perform the test. You may
find yourself in this situation, for instance, if you’re trying to figure out why
your VCR is on the fritz. Always consider that you may expose dangerously
high voltages when you remove the cover from any AC-operated equipment.
If you’re working close to equipment that conducts these voltages, cover the
equipment with insulating plastic to prevent accidental shock.
Connecting the probe to the circuit
The logic probe has four connections, as you can see in Figure 10-4. The red
and black leads use alligator clips so that you can securely attach them to
ground and the power supply of the circuit that you’re testing.
Be sure to first determine if the supply voltage of the circuit falls within the
acceptable range for the logic probe. Most probes work with a minimum
supply voltage of about 3 volts and a maximum of no more than 15 volts
(sometimes more, sometimes less). For the exact voltage range of your logic
probe, check the manufacturer’s instruction booklet.

Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You need to make these four connections:
 You clip the black power lead to circuit ground.
 Clip the red power lead to the circuit voltage supply. Be sure that this
supply doesn’t exceed about 15 volts, or you can damage the logic probe.
 You connect a second black ground lead to circuit ground. This separate
ground is important; if you fail to solidly connect the probe to circuit
ground, the probe may fail to work, or it may yield erratic results.
 Place the tip of the probe against the part of the circuit that you’re testing.
When you’ve made these connections, observe the probe’s reaction. Indicator
lights and audible tones (on most logic probes) help you determine the logic
level at the test point:
 Low indicator (accompanied by the low buzz tone): This reaction tells
you that the test point has a logic low (at or about 0 volts).
 High indicator (accompanied by the high buzz tone): This result indi-
cates that the test point has logic high (usually at or about 5 volts).
 Quickly toggling Low and High indicator: This reaction means that the
logic signal is pulsing (changing between low and high at a fast pace).
Note: Most logic probes have a separate indicator that tells you when a
circuit is pulsing.
 No indicator: If you get nothing from your probe, the test point has no
discernable high, low, or pulsing signal.
What if the indicator doesn’t indicate?
You may find logic circuits bewildering beasts, especially if you’re new to work-
ing with them. In some instances, the output of a logic circuit may yield no
indication of a signal. When you get this indication from your probe it doesn’t
necessarily mean that you have a faulty circuit. (But remember that, in many
cases, no signal means that your circuit does have a problem.) When the logic
probe gives no indication of a signal, the lack of signal can mean that you have
either a bad circuit or an incorrectly connected logic probe, or both.
When you’re trying to figure out why the probe doesn’t react to your circuit,
having a wiring diagram or some type of schematic for that circuit comes in
handy. 
213
Chapter 10: Getting Down with Logic Probes and Oscilloscopes
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You can help rule out the chance that you’ve incorrectly connected the probe
by conducting this quick test:
1. Touch the test lead of the probe to the power supply of the circuit.
The probe should indicate a high value.
2. Next, touch the test lead of the probe to the ground of the circuit.
Now, the probe should indicate a low value.
3. If either or both tests fail, examine the connection of the probe to the
circuit and make corrections as necessary.
Assuming that you have the probe connected properly, you can now use the
logic probe at additional test points in the circuit.
In the section “The Search for Spock: Using a Logic Probe,” earlier in this
chapter, we tell you that a logic circuit has only two possible outputs: low or
high. Although that’s technically true, some kinds of integrated logic circuits
have a third state, called Hi-Z or high-impedance. The reasons why this third
state exists go a little beyond the scope of this book, but in general, Hi-Z lets
you connect a lot of outputs directly together, with only one being active (or
enabled) at a time. The remaining outputs are set to their Hi-Z state, which
makes them essentially invisible to the enabled output. The circuit only
engages one output, either low or high, at any one time. The other outputs
are put to sleep in the Hi-Z state and get activated in their own due time.
Scoping Out the Oscilloscope
A true electronics gearhead poses for the high school alumni newsletter pic-
ture standing next to an oscilloscope. The scope is something of a badge of
honor. If you have one, let alone know how to use it, then everyone assumes
that you’re an electronics guru. Some things just look cool.
Though a little on the expensive side, the oscilloscope is the tool that any
die-hard electronics tech needs. For the average amateur electronics hobby-
ist working at home or in school, the oscilloscope is a nice tool to have
around, but if you’re less than obsessed, you don’t absolutely need it. So
unless you just have to look like a gearhead, you can get by without one . . .
for a little while, at least.
Although not everyone owns an oscilloscope, and not all electronics projects
require one, it still makes sense to introduce them to you and provide the
basics about how they work to complete your basic electronics education.

So, exactly what does it do?
The job of the oscilloscope is to visually represent an electrical signal, either
alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC). An oscilloscope shows vari-
ations in voltage as a bright line drawn on the display, as you can see in
Figure 10-5.
DC voltages appear as straight lines; their position vertically indicates the
voltage value. AC voltages appear as undulating lines, also called waveforms.
An oscilloscope shows both the AC signal voltage and its frequency. Pretty
cool stuff.
Figure 10-6 shows a fairly typical bench top oscilloscope identifying common
dials, jobs, and other controls. We get to what these features all mean in the
section “The Ins and Outs of Using an Oscilloscope,” later in this chapter.
The oscilloscope screen displays a grid; the X (horizontal) axis represents
time, and the Y (vertical) axis represents volts. Count the number of divisions
on the screen’s grid to determine the voltage and (if you’re using an AC or digi-
tal signal) the variation of the signal over time.

Sticking to common oscilloscope features
For the purposes of this chapter, we assume that you don’t have wads of
money in your pocket to buy the latest whiz-bang scope. Here’s what we
assume you probably have:
 You may already have an oscilloscope, maybe even an old relic, but
don’t yet know how to use it. Time to dust it off, plug it in, and fire it up!
 You have access to a scope through school or work. Maybe you can
arrange to borrow it in the school/work lab or even to take it home to
your own bench for those times when an oscilloscope is the tool that
you absolutely have to have to solve a problem.
 You find a great bargain on a used oscilloscope on eBay, and you’re will-
ing to take a chance. (You can often find a fairly nice used model for
under $100.)
With these assumptions in mind, this chapter limits itself to the most
common features found on oscilloscopes. We skip the very high-end stuff and
cover the features common to just about every scope made since 1970.

Oscilloscopes are fairly complicated pieces of equipment, and to thoroughly
understand their proper use, read the instruction manual that comes with the
scope or a book dedicated to the subject. This chapter gives you just a quick
overview to get you started. Visit one of the electronics sites mentioned in the
Appendix; many provide tutorials on using a scope.
Bench, handheld, or PC-based?
You can still find the old model of oscilloscope, with its dials, knobs, switches,
and a cathode ray tube (CRT). In fact, professional electronics field technicians
still prefer bench CRT scopes. But these days, you can choose from several
types, and each type has its advantages and disadvantages. We take a moment
to review them in the following sections.
Bench scope
The bench oscilloscope, like the one in Figure 10-7, provides a bright and clear
image on its glowing green screen. Even on the latest models, you can get your
hands on all the basic functions and controls with front-panel switches and
dials. This setup allows you to quickly select the operating modes of the scope
without meandering through a series of on-screen programming menus.
If you’re looking for a used oscilloscope, you’re most likely to find the bench
variety. They’ve been making them for decades, but the newer models include
computer interfaces and other advanced features.

Handheld scope
For on-the-go work, nothing beats a portable handheld oscilloscope. Looking a
bit like a Star Trek tri-corder, the handheld scope provides all the basic func-
tions of a scope, but in a battery-operated, palm-sized tool. The screen is a
liquid crystal display, and although smaller than the screen on the average
bench scope, it’s still functional and readable.
You may find handheld oscilloscopes very handy (no pun intended!) if you’re
on the go, but they don’t usually offer all the advanced features of the better
bench oscilloscopes. If you need the latest and greatest, rely on a handheld
model only when portability is a must.
PC-based scope
The PC-based oscilloscope doesn’t have a screen of its own. Instead, it uses
your personal computer (either desktop or laptop) to store and display the
electrical signals that you measure. Most PC-based scopes are self-contained
in a small, external module. The scope connects to the desktop PC or laptop
through a parallel, serial, or USB port. A few manufacturers have designed
PC-based oscilloscopes that you can install inside your computer. These
plug into one of the available expansion slots inside the chassis of your
desktop PC.
Many PC-based oscilloscopes cost less than a similarly equipped bench
scope. They also take advantage of the features built into your PC, such as
disk storage and printing. Obviously, the PC-based scope has one big disad-
vantage: You have to have access to a PC, either permanently plopped on your
electronics bench or temporarily brought in (as with a laptop) when you
need it.
218
Part IV: Getting Your Hands Dirty 
Some enhanced features you should know about
Oscilloscopes have improved greatly over the
years, with many added features and capabili-
ties. Although you don’t absolutely need any of
the following features for routine testing, you
may find them handy as you gain experience.
Among the most useful features are
 Delayed sweep: When analyzing a small
portion of a long, complex signal, this fea-
ture helps because you can zoom into just
a portion of the signal and examine it. This is
ideal when you work with television signals. 
 Digital storage: This feature records signals
in computerized memory for later recall.
After you have it in the memory, you can
expand the signal and analyze specific por-
tions; again, helpful in television work.
Digital storage also lets you compare sig-
nals, even if you take the measurements at
different times.
As you may expect, these features can add to
the cost of the scope. Balance the extra cost
against the usefulness of the features.

Understanding oscilloscope 
bandwidth and resolution
You should know about a couple of notable specifications for oscilloscopes.
One of the most important specs is bandwidth. Bandwidth is the highest fre-
quency signal that you can reliably test with your oscilloscope, measured in
megahertz (MHz). PC-based scope probes tend to have the lowest bandwidth,
usually about 5-10 MHz. This bandwidth works just fine for many tasks, includ-
ing working with hobby circuits and even servicing VCRs and audio equipment.
The average bandwidth of a low-cost bench scope falls in the 20-35 MHz
range. This range does the job for all but the most demanding applications.
Specialized troubleshooting and repair, such as work on computers and ultra-
high-frequency radio gear, may require bandwidths exceeding 100 MHz. But
remember that the price of an oscilloscope goes up considerably as the
bandwidth gets higher.
Another important specification is resolution. The resolution of the scope has
to do with its accuracy. The X (horizontal) axis on an oscilloscope displays
time, and the Y (vertical) axis displays voltage. The horizontal amplifier indi-
cates the X-axis resolution. Most scopes generally have a resolution of 0.5
microseconds (millionths of a second) or faster. You can adjust the sweep
time so that you can test signal events that occur over a longer time period,
usually as long as a half a second to a second. Note that the screen can dis-
play signal events faster than 0.5 microseconds, but such a small signal may
appear as a fleeting glitch or voltage spike.
The sensitivity of an oscilloscope indicates the Y-axis voltage per division.
The low-voltage sensitivity of most average-priced scopes is about 5 mV 
(millivolts, or thousandths of a volt) to 5 volts. You turn a dial to set the sen-
sitivity that you want. When you set the dial to 5 mV, each mark on the face 
of the scope tube represents a difference of 5 mV. Voltage levels lower than 5
mV may appear, but you can’t accurately measure them. Most scopes show
very low voltage levels (microvolt range) as a slight ripple.
The ins and outs of using an oscilloscope
Although an oscilloscope can do some pretty cool things, you only have to
perform a couple of steps to actually use one.
Here’s a quick rundown of the steps that you perform to measure the voltage
of a DC signal with an oscilloscope:
1. Attach a test probe to the scope input.
Note: Some scopes have several inputs, called channels; we assume
you’re dealing with just one input for now.
219
Chapter 10: Getting Down with Logic Probes and Oscilloscopes
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

2. Adjust the Volts Per Division control to set the amplitude or voltage
range.
For example, if the voltage you’re testing is 0-5 volts, use the 1 volt per
division range. With that setting, each volt corresponds to one tick mark
on the screen of the scope.
3. Adjust the Sweep/Time Per Division control to set the time slice of the
signal. 
The time slice is the duration of the part of the signal that’s shown on
the scope. A shorter time slice shows only a brief portion of the signal,
whereas a longer time slice shows you more of it.
If you’re testing a DC signal, you don’t need this control because the
signal doesn’t change (much) over time. You can choose a medium-
range setting to ensure consistent readings, such as 1 millisecond per
division (a millisecond is one one-thousandth of a second).
4. Select the signal type, either AC or DC, and the input channel.
Note that you don’t get an input channel selector if you buy a single-
channel oscilloscope.
5. Most scopes have a trigger switch. If yours does, set it to Auto.
6. When you’ve set up the oscilloscope properly, connect the test probe
to the signal that you want to test.
7. Connect the ground of the probe to the ground of the circuit.
8. Connect the probe itself to the circuit point that you want to test (you
can see this setup in Figure 10-8).
9. Read the waveform displayed on the screen. 
Unless your scope has a direct read-out function that displays voltages
on the screen, you need to correlate what you’re seeing with the settings
of the s.
If you’re testing a low-voltage AC or pulsing digital signal, set the Sweep/Time
Per Division control so that you can adequately see each cycle of the signal.
Don’t worry . . . you can experiment with the Sweep/Time Per Division control
until the signal looks the way that you want it to.
Do not test AC voltage coming from a wall outlet using an oscilloscope, unless
you first take special precautions. The manual that came with your scope
should outline those precautions. We assume you are using your oscilloscope
only to test low-voltage DC circuits, and low-voltage AC signals, such as those
from a microphone. If you connect your scope directly to 117 VAC from a wall
outlet you can injure both you and your scope!

What all the wiggly lines mean
Oscilloscopes give you a visual representation of an electrical signal. The ver-
tical axis indicates the amount of voltage (also called amplitude), and the hor-
izontal axis represents time. Oscilloscopes always sweep left to right, so you
read the timeline of the signal from left to right, just as you read a line in a book.
The signal that you observe on the oscilloscope is a waveform. Some wave-
forms are simple, some are complex. (We introduce the concept of waveforms
and different signal types in Chapter 1.) Figure 10-9 shows the four most
common waveforms that you encounter in electronics and what these wave-
forms look like on an oscilloscope screen: 
 DC (direct current) waveform: A flat, straight line, like the one that you
see here. A DC waveform’s amplitude, which is the voltage reading, is
critical.
 AC (alternating current) waveform: This waveform undulates over
time. The most common waveform is a sine wave (see Chapter 1 for
more about sine waves). AC waveforms vary in frequency. Some move
quite slowly, such as 60 Hz (60 cycles per second), the frequency of
house current in North America. Or AC waveforms can move very
quickly, on the order of several million or billion Hertz.

 Digital waveform: A DC signal that varies between no volts (low) to some
pre-determined voltage (high). The digital circuitry interprets the timing
and spacing of the low and high marks. When you plug in a digital camera
to your computer, the computer copies the pictures stored in the camera
to its hard drive by using such a waveform. The waveform changes very
quickly so that you can transmit the data in a short period of time.
 Pulse waveform: This waveform shows a sudden change between a
signal’s low and high states. Most pulse waveforms are digital and usu-
ally serve as a timing mark, like the starter’s gun in a 440 yard dash.
When the gun goes off (the pulse) other parts of the circuit react and
generate even more signals.

So, When Do I Use an Oscilloscope?
When you’re testing voltage levels, you can often use multimeters and oscillo-
scopes interchangeably. The choice of which tool you use is yours, though
for routine testing procedures, you may find the multimeter a little easier. In
general, you may opt to use an oscilloscope for
 Visually determining if an AC or digital signal has the proper timing.
For example, you often need this test when you troubleshoot radio and
television equipment. The service manuals and schematics for these
devices often show the expected oscilloscope waveform at various
points in the circuit so that you can compare. Very handy!
 Testing pulsating signals that change too rapidly for a logic probe to
detect. Generally these are signals that change faster than about five mil-
lion times a second (5 MHz).
 Visually testing the relationship between two input signals, when using
an oscilloscope with two input channels. You may need to do this test
when you work with some digital circuits, for example. One signal may
trigger the circuit to generate yet another signal. In fact, this is quite
common. Being able to see both signals together helps you determine
whether the circuit is working as it should.
 Testing voltages, if the scope is handy; but you can use your multimeter
for testing voltages, too.
Rather than whipping out your oscilloscope for every test, you’re better off
using a multimeter for the following:
 Testing the resistance of a circuit
 Determining if a wire or other circuit is shorted (0 ohms resistance) or
open (infinite ohms resistance)
 Measuring current
 Testing voltages and various components, such as capacitors and 
transistors
Putting the Oscilloscope to 
Work: Testing, 1-2-3!
So if you’ve been reading along in this chapter, you now know a little bit about
what an oscilloscope is for and what it does. In the following sections, we
show you how to do a couple of quick tests. These tests demonstrate how
you use a scope for a variety of simple chores. After you work through these
tests, you’re well on your way to becoming a master scope user.

Basic setup and initial testing
Before you use your oscilloscope for any actual testing, set its controls to a
normal or neutral setting. You then calibrate the scope, using its built-in test
point, so that you’re sure it’s working correctly.
Here are the steps for setting up your scope. Refer to Figure 10-6, earlier in
this chapter, to reference the various knobs and buttons on your scope as
you go through these steps. Remember that your oscilloscope may look a bit
different, and its knobs and controls may have slightly different names.
1. Turn the scope on.
If it’s the CRT bench top variety, allow time for the tube to warm up. You
may or may not see a dot or line on the screen.
2. Set the Sweep/Time Per Division knob to 1 millisecond.
This setting is a good middle value for initial calibration.
3. Set the Volts Per Division knob to 0.5 volts.
This setting is also a good middle value to use for initial calibration
when testing low-voltage DC circuits.
4. Set the Trigger Level control to Automatic (or midway, if it doesn’t
have an Automatic setting). Select AC Sync and Internal Sweep.
5. Select the Auto setting for both Horizontal Position and Vertical
Position; or you can crank the knobs to their midpoint if your scope
doesn’t have an Auto setting.
6. Connect a test probe to the input.
If your scope has multiple channels (sometimes called inputs), use
Channel A.
7. Select Gnd (Ground) for the Signal Clamp, if your scope has this 
control. 
On some scopes, this control may be called Signal Coupling.
8. Connect the ground clip of the test probe to the designated ground
connection on the scope (see Figure 10-10).
If your oscilloscope doesn’t have a designated ground connection, clip
the lead to any exposed metal point, such as the head of a screw.
9. If your scope has a Signal Clamp switch, attach the center of the test
probe to the calibration test point. If your scope lacks a Signal Clamp
switch, attach the center of the test probe to the ground point.

10. Adjust the Vertical Position knob until the beam sits on the first divi-
sion on the screen (Figure 10-11).
11. Adjust the Horizontal Position knob until the beam is more or less
centered on the screen.
You don’t need to worry about making this setting exact.
12. If your scope has a Signal Clamp switch, set it to DC. If you don’t have
a Signal Clamp switch, move the test probe from its ground connec-
tion to the calibration test point.
Many oscilloscopes use a test signal that appears as a relatively low-frequency
square wave. (Forgot what a square wave looks like? Review Chapter 1 for
details.) Consult the manual that came with your scope to see what voltage
and frequency your scope produces with its built-in test calibration circuit. 
For example, say that the signal should be 0.5 volts peak-to-peak (indicated
as 0.5v p-p) at 1000 Hz. Because you set the Volts per Division knob to 0.5
volts and the test signal has amplitude of 0.5 volts, the waveform spans one
division on the screen.

By decreasing the Volts Per Division setting, you can make the waveform
larger. Do this adjustment when you need more accuracy. For example, if you
set the Volts Per Division knob to 0.1 volts, a 0.5 volt test signal spans five
divisions.
Does your battery have any juice?
Admit it. You have a drawer full of spare batteries, and you sure would like to
know just how much voltage the darn things have to give, right? A rudimen-
tary test that you can perform using the oscilloscope is measuring voltage. A
battery produces a DC voltage, so the sweep setting on the scope is irrele-
vant in this test. You just want to know what voltage the scope displays on
the screen.
For this demonstration, you test the voltage of a 9-volt battery: So, first, dig
around in your drawer and pull out a 9-volt battery; then, follow these steps:
1. Follow the basic setup and initial testing procedure outlined in the
previous section.
2. Set the Volts Per Division knob to 2 volts.
3. Attach the ground clip of the test probe to the – (negative) terminal of
the battery.

4. Attach the center of the test probe to the + (positive) terminal of the
battery.
The line on the screen should fall approximately mid-way between the
fourth and fifth divisions. Because you have the Volts per Division knob
set at 2 volts, this line placement indicates that your battery has 9 volts,
or 4.5 divisions times 2.
Dissecting your radio to display 
an audio waveform
You can have a lot of fun with this test because you get to take apart a gadget
to run the test. Oscilloscopes can visually represent the AC waveform, which
is the electrical signal that drives a speaker. The AC waveform is complex
because it’s made up of constantly changing frequencies. These changing 
frequencies are what you hear as singing, talking, or the sound of musical
instruments.
For this test, pry off the back of an ordinary battery-powered radio so that
you can reach the two terminals on the speaker. Then, follow these steps:
1. Follow the setup-and-testing procedure outlined in the section “Basic
setup and initial testing,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Set the Volts Per Division knob to 1 volt.
3. Set the Sweep/Time Per Division knob to 100 microseconds.
4. Attach the ground clip of the test probe to one of the speaker terminals.
5. Attach the center of the test probe to the other speaker terminal.
6. Turn on the radio and watch the display.
7. If at first you don’t get much of a reading, try, try again by decreasing
the Volts Per Division setting.
Here are some things to watch for when you perform this test:
 The amplitude of the waveform increases and decreases as you change
the volume on the radio. This change happens because the volume con-
trol alters the signal voltage that you apply to the speaker.
 By turning the Sweep/Time -Per Division knob, you can see finer
detail’s of the signal. A slower sweep of, say, 0.1 milliseconds displays 
frequencies of up to 1000 Hz per division. A faster sweep of, say, 100
microseconds displays frequencies of up to 10,000 Hz per division.
If you have access to a signal test generator that can produce a single tone,
you can use this same technique to take a look at its waveform. Rather than 
a mish-mash of squiggly lines, you see a distinct sine wave.

Testing the frequency of an AC circuit
You can determine the frequency of an AC signal by using an oscilloscope.
Now, although you can plug the test probe of the scope into a wall socket to
display the 60 Hz (50 Hz in some parts of the world) alternating current
coming out of it, DON’T! This poses a significant safety hazard so don’t even
think about it. Instead, test the frequency of your household current indi-
rectly (and more safely), using a phototransistor.
For this test, you need a phototransistor (not a photodiode or photoresistor,
but a phototransistor, which is a light-dependent transistor), and a 10K resistor
(head over to Chapters 4 and 5 if you need a refresher on these parts).
Connect the phototransistor and resistor to a 9-volt battery, like the setup in
Figure 10-12. Grab a lamp outfitted with an incandescent bulb, and you’re
ready to go!
1. Follow the setup-and-testing procedure outlined in the section “Basic
setup and initial testing,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Set the Volts Per Division knob to 1 volt.
3. Set the Sweep/Time Per Division knob to 10 milliseconds.
4. Attach the ground clip of the test probe to the – (negative) terminal of
the battery.
5. Attach the center of the test probe to the point where you have con-
nected the phototransistor and resistor.
6. Turn on the light and note the ripple in the waveform.

This ripple is the AC current pulsing through the incandescent lamp. For
best results, don’t shine the lamp directly into the phototransistor. This
direct exposure may swamp the transistor, and you can’t see any signal
change. Direct the light away until you can see a sine wave. Adjust the
Volts Per Division knob until you get a decent reading.
Have you been staring at the light, trying to see the changes in brightness as
the AC current pulses? You can’t see the lamp getting alternately brighter or
dimmer with the naked eye because of a phenomenon called persistence of
vision. But the phototransistor acts much faster than your eyes: It can detect
very quick changes in light.
An oscilloscope shows you the period of an AC signal, not its frequency. You
have to do some math to convert one into the other. A 60 Hz signal has a
period of 0.0166 seconds, which you can determine with a bit of simple math:
sec
Frequency
Period in
onds

You convert time period to frequency by changing the math around a little:
Period

Forget for the moment that you already know that the frequency of the AC cur-
rent that the scope senses through the phototransistor is 60 Hz. To determine
the frequency just by reading the scope, you first measure the distance from
crest-to-crest of the waveform. You then do the math that we just walked you
through. Assuming that you set the Sweep/Time Per Division knob to 10 milli-
seconds, each crest-to-trough transition of the AC signal spans about 1.6 
divisions.

Because you set the Sweep/Time Per Division knob to 10 milliseconds, you
have to divide the result by 0.01 (10 milliseconds). You end up with 62.5,
close enough to 60 Hz for our purposes.
But wait! When you test the output of the phototransistor, the waveform
spans only about 0.8 of a division. What gives? The phototransistor actually
registers 120 flashes of light per second because the light pulses each time
that the AC current goes positive or negative. In this case, because we’re test-
ing the AC waveform indirectly, you need to cut the result in half.

You may have noticed that an oscilloscope provides only an approximation
of the frequency of a signal. If you need something more accurate, you need 
a frequency counter. These babies use a digital readout to display signal fre-
quency, and they’re accurate to within one in several hundred thousand
Hertz. Check out Chapter 16 for more about frequency counters.

n the three chapters that follow you discover how to
build your own circuits using a nifty little device called
a solderless breadboard. You just plug in parts and you’ve
got a circuit! Changes are easy to make, and when you’re
done experimenting, you can produce a permanent sol-
dered circuit board. The chapters in this part tell you how
to do that, too.
And it gets even better. In the pages that follow you also
uncover the magic and power of something called a micro-

to do your bidding. Finally, you can move on to Chapter 14
and follow along with a dozen fun projects you can build in

Creating Your Own 
Breadboard Circuit
In This Chapter
 All about solderless breadboards (and why you should use them)
 Making a circuit with a solderless breadboard
 Transferring circuits to solder breadboards
 Using perf boards for all your circuit needs
 Creating sturdy circuits with wire-wrapping
You may think that you’d get funny looks if you ask for a “breadboard” at
your local super-duper electronics-parts mart. After all, what does bread
have to do with electronic gizmos? But no, you can expect to get a smile of
appreciation for your do-it-yourself spirit, and the friendly sales staff will
point you to the make-your-own-circuits aisle. In that aisle, you find a bunch
of funny-looking white square or rectangular plastic thingies with more holes
than Swiss cheese.
These little critters are circuit breadboards, and you use them to experiment
with all kinds of electronic ideas without having to warm up your soldering
iron. You use them to create a sort of rough draft of a circuit board that you
can play with before you go to the trouble of creating a finished, printed cir-
cuit board. It’s easy to fix mistakes at the breadboarding stage.
In this chapter, we tell you all about circuit breadboards and how to use them.
They’re pretty simple, actually. You don’t need a degree in engineering to use
them, but we do have some tips and suggestions that you don’t want to miss.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

We also include a couple of circuit board construction techniques in this
chapter, including point-to-point wiring and something called wire wrap-
ping. You can use these techniques when you’re ready to make a permanent
circuit.
For now, though, you just play!
Taking a Look at Solderless Breadboards
Circuit breadboards, also called prototyping boards or solderless breadboards
come in all shapes, styles, and sizes, but they all serve the same function:
They have columns of holes that little slivers of metal connect electrically.
You plug in components — resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, inte-
grated circuits . . . you name it — and then string the wires to build your cir-
cuit. When you’re confident that the circuit works, you can use one of the
many construction techniques available to you. (We talk about some of your
construction options in Chapter 12.)
Don’t skip the step of first testing all the circuits that you plan to build on
a solderless breadboard. Often, you can improve on the performance of the
circuit just by tweaking a few component values. You can easily do these
changes by simply removing one component on the breadboard — without
having to unsolder and resolder — and exchanging it for another.
The following sections tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
solderless breadboards.
Solderless breadboards, inside and out
A solderless breadboard, like the basic model in Figure 11-1, consists of a
series of square holes, and inside the holes are rows and rows of metal strips.
The metal strips, which are made of a flexible material, have been bent to
make a channel. You slide wire into the holes and securely connect it inside
the metal channel.
You call the metal channels inside the breadboard contacts. Each column in
each row connects electrically. Each column connects together five holes, all
also electrically joined. With this setup, you can connect components and
wires just by plugging them into the right holes on the board. See Figure 11-2
for a visual representation of how the columns in a breadboard connect 
electrically.

Note also the long rows of contacts at the very top and bottom of the solder-
less breadboard. These rows help you make convenient connections to power
and ground. Most boards have two rows at the top and bottom. In some
boards, the two rows connect electrically, but on others, each row is electri-
cally isolated from the other. Don’t assume! Use your multimeter to check by
sticking a jumper wire in each hole and then touching one probe to one wire
and another probe to the other wire. If you get a low ohm reading, the two
rows are connected together. If you get an infinite ohms reading, they’re not
connected. See Chaper 9 for more about testing things with your multimeter.
The holes are spaced 1⁄10 of an inch apart (0.100 inch), a size just right for inte-
grated circuits, most transistors, and discrete components, such as capaci-
tors and resistors. You just plug in ICs, resistors, capacitors, transistors, and
20- or 22-gauge wire in the proper contact holes to create your circuit.

Solderless breadboards are 
cheap . . . er, inexpensive
Author Gordon McComb here to relate a little
personal story: For years, and I mean years, I got
by with a single solderless breadboard. Every
time I wanted to try a new circuit, I had to disas-
semble the old one to make room for my latest
and greatest idea. Sometimes I wasn’t com-
pletely finished with the old circuit, so I had to
rebuild it from scratch. That meant taking apart
my new circuit and reconstructing the old one.
Needless to say, this process was very time con-
suming (and more than a little annoying).
In hindsight, I can see how dumb my single-
breadboard lifestyle was. Basic solderless
breadboards aren’t all that expensive. Most
cost under $10. You make things a lot easier on
yourself by simply having several solderless
breadboards in your toolkit and building differ-
ent circuits on them. You can leave a circuit on
the board until you’re done with it or until you
run out of boards for your new projects.
You can also use multiple breadboards to build
circuits bit by bit. You essentially build each part
of the circuit as a module. This approach lets
you experiment with different sections of a
more complicated circuit, perfecting each sec-
tion before going on to the next. You can then
use a couple of wires to easily connect the
modular breadboards together.
To make a really sophisticated experimenter’s
station, buy some wide Velcro® strips and
attach the strips onto a piece of 12 x 12-inch
wood. You can get wood already cut to this size
at most hobby or craft stores. Then, stick a strip
of the mating piece of the Velcro® to the under-
side of each of your solderless breadboards.
When you want to use a board, just press the
Velcro® on the board to the Velcro® on the
square of wood, helping your breadboard stay
put while you work on it. With this trick, you
don’t have to worry about the breadboards slid-
ing around and pulling their wires out of their
sockets.

Breadboard manufacturers make contact strips from a springy metal coated
with a plating. The plating prevents the contacts from oxidizing, and the
springiness of the metal allows you to use different diameter wires and com-
ponent leads without seriously deforming the contacts. However, you can
damage the contacts if you attempt to use wire larger than 20 gauge or com-
ponents with very thick leads. If the wire is too thick to go into the hole, 
don’t try to force it. Otherwise, you can loosen the fit of the contact, and
your breadboard may not work the way you want it to.
When you’re not using it, keep your breadboard in a resealable sandwich bag.
Why? To keep out the dust. Dirty contacts make for poor electrical connec-
tions. Although you can use a spray-on electrical cleaner to remove dust and
other contaminants, you make things easier on yourself by keeping the bread-
board clean in the first place.
All sizes, big and small
Solderless breadboards come in many sizes. Breadboards with 550 contact
points accommodate designs with about three or four 14- or 16-pin integrated
circuits, plus a small handful of resistors and capacitors.
For the most flexibility, get a double-width board, such as the one you see in
Figure 11-3. This style accommodates at least 10 ICs and provides over 1,200
contact points. If you’re into really elaborate design work, you can purchase
extra large breadboards that contain 3,200 contacts or more.

Obviously, don’t overdo it when buying a solderless breadboard. You don’t
need to buy one the size of Wyoming if you’re making only a small circuit to
power a light bulb. If you get into the middle of designing a circuit and find
that you need a little more breadboard power, remember that some solder-
less breadboards have interlocking ridges so that you can put several together
to make a larger breadboard.
Creating a Circuit with Your 
Solderless Breadboard
Essentially breadboarding consists of putting components onto the board
with wires. But there’s a right way to do things and a wrong way. This section
gives you the lowdown on what type of wire to use, efficient breadboarding
techniques, and the ins and outs of giving your board a neat, logical design.
Why you gotta get pre-stripped wires
You have to use solid (not stranded) insulated wires to connect components
together on your breadboard. You should use 20- to 22-gauge wire. Thicker or
thinner wire doesn’t work well in a breadboard. Too thick and the wire won’t
go into the holes; too thin and the electrical contact will be poor.
As we suggest in Chapter 5, stay away from stranded wire. The individual
strands can break off, lodging inside the metal contacts of the breadboard.
While you’re buying your breadboard, purchase a set of pre-stripped wires.
(Don’t get cheap now; this is worth it.) Pre-stripped wires come in a variety of
lengths and are already stripped (obviously) and bent, ready for you to use in
breadboards. A set of pre-stripped wires costs from $5 to $7, but you can bet
the price is well worth the time that you save. Otherwise, you need to buy a
bunch of wire and painstakingly cut off about a 1⁄3 inch of the insulation on
each end.
The assortments that you find in stores come with wires cut to different
lengths. Table 11-1 gives you a rundown of the lengths and quantities from
one popular assortment.

You may find that you need more wires of some lengths than you get in the
assortment, so buy two. But the odds are that one day you will be missing
one length of prestripped wire, and you’ll have to strip a wire or two. You can
actually cut your own lengths, and then use a wire stripper to do the job. It’s
best to use a stripper that has a dial adjustment. Set the dial for the gauge of
wire that you’re using, say 20 or 22. This setting prevents the stripper from
nicking the wire; nicks weaken the wire. A weak wire can get stuck inside a
breadboard hole, which can ruin your whole day.
To make your own breadboard wire, follow these steps:
1. Cut the wire to length.
2. Strip off about 1⁄4- to 1⁄3-inch of insulation from both ends.
While stripping the insulation, insert one end of the wire into the strip-
ping tool and hold the other end with a pair of needle-nosed pliers. If you
have an automatic wire-stripper/cutter tool (available at some hardware
stores; check the electrical parts section), you can cut the wire and strip
the insulation in one easy step.
3. After stripping the insulation, use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to
bend the exposed ends of the wire at a 90-degree angle, as you can
see in Figure 11-4.

Breadboarding techniques
Over the years, through trial and error, we’ve discovered some tips for using
solderless breadboards. To save you the painful learning curve, here are some
of our favorites:
 Use a chip inserter/extractor (most stores that sell electronics stuff 
sell these; they are about the shape of a ballpoint pen) to implant and
remove ICs (integrated circuits). This nifty tool reduces the chances that
you damage the IC while handling it. If you’re working with CMOS chips,
which are especially sensitive to static electricity, ground the inserter/
extractor tool to eliminate stray static electricity. (If you need a refresher
on integrated circuits, both the CMOS and TTL varieties, take a look at
Chapter 4.)
 When you’re using CMOS chips, build the rest of the circuit first. If you
need to, use a dummy TTL IC to make sure that you wired everything
properly. TTL chips aren’t nearly as sensitive to static as the CMOS vari-
ety. Be sure to provide connections for the positive and negative power
supply and that you connect all inputs (tie those inputs that you’re not

using to the positive or negative supply rail). When you’re ready to test
the circuit, remove the dummy chip and replace it with the CMOS IC.
 When inserting wire, use a pair of small needle-nosed pliers to plug the
end of the wire into the contact hole. If the wire is too short, use the pliers
to gently pull it out of the hole when you’re done with the breadboard.
 Never expose a breadboard to heat, because you can permanently
damage the plastic. ICs and other components that become very hot
(because of a short circuit or excess current, for example) may melt the
plastic underneath them. Touch all the components while you have the
circuit under power to check for overheating.
 Solderless breadboards are designed for low-voltage DC experiments.
They’re not designed for, nor are they safe, carrying 117 VAC house 
current.
 You won’t always be able to finish and test a circuit in one sitting. If you
have to put your breadboard circuit aside for a while, put it out of the
reach of children, animals, and the overly curious — you know the type,
people who seem to always poke their fingers where they don’t belong. 
Neatness counts
You can easily build a bird’s nest on your breadboard by routing connection
wires carelessly. Neatness and tidiness are the keys to success when using a
solderless breadboard. Messy wiring makes it harder to debug the circuit,
and a tangle of wires greatly increases the chance of mistakes. Wires pull out
when you don’t want them to. Worse, the tangle of wires can cause the circuit
to malfunction altogether. Chaos ensues.
Carefully plan and construct your breadboard circuits. This planning requires
more time and patience on your part, but after you build a few projects, you
find that the extra effort is well worth it. If you follow the advice in the next
three sections, you’ll greatly improve the neatness factor of the circuits that
you build on your solderless breadboard.
Avoiding the crowd
Give yourself enough room to move around. If your circuit uses integrated
circuits, start with those and provide at least three to five columns of holes
between each IC. Go for ten empty columns between each IC if you can. Then
add the other components.
If the breadboard is too small to accommodate all the parts, switch to a bigger
one. Or, if you don’t have a bigger breadboard, purchase a second one and
string them together.
241
Chapter 11: Creating Your Own Breadboard Circuit

Don’t worry about urban sprawl on your breadboards. You do better to place
the components a little farther apart than to jam them too close together.
Keeping a lot of distance between ICs and components also helps you to
tweak and refine the circuit. You can more easily add parts without disturb-
ing the existing ones.
Logical layouts
The row/column arrangement of breadboards invites you to create a rather
haphazard layout of a circuit. One approach is to put the primary compo-
nent, such as a 555 timer IC or a microcontroller, in the middle of the board
and work your way out.
Here are more layout ideas:
 If you can, place the components in a way that reduces the number of
jumper wires (a jumper wire can be any old wire; it’s the fact that you
use it to jump from one connection to another that gives it its name).
The more wiring that you have to insert, the more crowded the board
becomes and wires can come loose.
 Don’t be afraid to clip some extra length off the leads of components.
Resistors, capacitors, and diodes don’t cost much. Cutting off excess
leads lets you lay components flat against the board, which helps them
stay in place (see Figure 11-5). Save these parts for use on another cir-
cuit, or just toss them, if the leads are too short.
 Use a small pair of pliers to bend the leads and wires to a 90-degree
angle. Keep the wires as close to the board as possible. This positioning
helps prevent the wires from pulling loose while you’re working on the
circuit.
Establishing common connection points
The two most common connections in most circuits are power and ground.
Solderless breadboards provide a convenient point for these connections in
the long rows along the top or bottom.
If a circuit requires other common connection points, and you don’t have
enough points in one column of holes (breadboards usually have five holes
per column), use longer pieces of wire to bring the connection out to another
part of the board where you have more space. You can make the common
connection point one or two columns between a couple of integrated circuits,
for instance.

Making the Move from Your Circuit

So you’ve perfected the world’s greatest circuit, and you want to make it per-

board, also called a solder board, an experimenter’s PC board, or a universal
solder board. The solder breadboard allows you to take any design that you
create on a solderless breadboard and make it permanent. You can transfer
your design to a solder board easily because the solder breadboard has the
exact same layout as the solderless breadboard.
To transfer your design, you simply pick the parts off your solderless bread-
board, insert them in the solder breadboard, and solder them into place in
the corresponding spots. Use wires like you did in the original solderless
breadboard to connect components that aren’t electrically connected by the
metal strips of the circuit board. (If you’re new to soldering, and what’s
involved, be sure to read Chapter 8.)
If you design a really small circuit, you can use just one half of a solder bread-
board. Before transferring the components, cut the solder breadboard with a
hacksaw. Try not to breath in the dust produced by the saw. Clean the por-
tion of the board that you want to use and solder away. See Chapter 12 for
more information on cutting and cleaning circuit boards.

Leave space at the corners of the board so that you can drill mounting holes.
You use these holes to secure the board inside whatever enclosure your pro-
ject provides (such as the chassis of a robot). Alternatively, you can secure
the board to a frame or within an enclosure by using double-sided foam tape.
The tape cushions the board and prevents breakage, and the thickness of the
foam prevents the underside of the board from actually touching the chassis.
Solder breadboards have one main disadvantage: They don’t use space very
efficiently. Unless you cram the components onto the board, the breadboard
limits you to building circuits with only two or four integrated circuits and a
handful of discrete components. In time, you can figure out how to conserve
space and make good use of the real estate on a solder board.

My breadboard circuit doesn’t work right!
By now, you realize that electronics is a screwy
science. Sometimes things work, and sometimes
they don’t. But you’re not dealing with the fickle
finger of fate; electronics misbehave for very
real, understandable (and mostly fixable!) rea-
sons. As you work with breadboards, you may
encounter the fairly common problem of stray
capacitance. This condition occurs when com-
ponents and wires produce unwanted capaci-
tance (stored charge) in a circuit. This situation
can happen when a bunch of wires criss-cross,
for example.
The reason this occurs is a bit complex, but it has
to do with the strips of metal used inside the
breadboard, and also the longer lead lengths of
the components. All circuits have an inherent
capacitance. It can’t be avoided. When there are
lots of wires going every which way, the capac-
itance can unexpectedly increase— this is stray
capacitance. At a certain point (and it differs
from one circuit to the next) the changes in
capacitance can cause the circuit to misbehave.
Although most circuits that you test with a sol-
derless breadboard work well enough, some
projects behave erratically or unpredictably if
you don’t build them by using a printed circuit
board and solder. You really need to be aware
of this fact if you’re working with RF (radio fre-
quency) circuits, such as radio receivers and
transmitters, digital circuits that use signals that
change at a very fast rate (on the order of a
couple of million Hertz), and more sensitive
timing circuits that rely on exact component
values. Solderless breadboards have a ten-
dency to change the characteristics of some
components, most notably capacitors and
inductors; these variations can change the way
a circuit behaves.
If you’re building a radio or other circuit that
stray capacitance can affect, you may have to
forego the step of first building the circuit on a
solderless breadboard. You may have better
luck with the performance of the circuit by
going straight to a solder breadboard or another
type of soldering board, which we describe in
the section “Prototyping with Pre-Drilled Perf
Boards.”
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Prototyping with Pre-Drilled Perf Boards
Solder breadboards aren’t the only kind of general-purpose circuit board that
you can use for your projects. You have another option in a pre-drilled perf
board with copper traces for wiring. These boards go by many names, such as
a grid board or a universal, general-purpose, or prototyping PC board. Perf
boards come in a variety of sizes and styles. Figure 11-6 shows a few perf board
styles. All styles are designed for you to use with ICs and other modern-day
electronics components, which means the holes are spaced 0.100 inch apart.
You may find perf boards handy when you want a soldered circuit but don’t
want to go through the much more laborious process of making your own cir-
cuit board from scratch. One of the main ways that you use perf boards is to
construct circuits by using wire wrapping (see the section “Getting Wrapped
Up in Wire Wrapping,” later in this chapter for more about this). If the board
has pads and traces on it, and most do, you can solder components directly
onto it. But you can use a perf board without any copper pads and traces
when you use the wire wrapping method.

You can choose the style of grid board based on the type of circuit that you’re
building. Some grid layouts suit certain applications better than others.
Personally, we prefer the plain universal PC board with interleaved busses, 
as we think they are easier to use. (You don’t ride the buss on a circuit board,
you solder things to it. A buss in the electronics world is just a common con-
nection point.) You tie components together on the universal PC board, using
three- (or more) point contacts.
A buss runs throughout the circuit board so that you can easily attach com-
ponents to it. Many perf boards have at least two busses, one for power and
one for ground. The busses run up and down the board, as you can see in
Figure 11-7. This layout works ideally for circuits that use many integrated
circuits. Alternating the busses for the power supply and ground also helps
to reduce undesirable inductive and capacitive effects.
You use the perf board just as you use a solder breadboard. After cleaning
the board so that the copper pads and traces are bright and shiny, plug the
components into the board and solder them into place. Use insulated wire to
connect components that aren’t adjacent to one another.

Getting Wrapped Up in Wire Wrapping
Wire wrapping is a point-to-point wiring system that uses a special tool and
extra-fine 28- or 30-gauge wrapping wire. When you do it properly, wire-
wrapped circuits are as sturdy as soldered circuits. And you have the added
benefit of being able to make modifications and corrections without the
hassle of desoldering and resoldering.
You have to limit wire wrapping to projects that use only low-voltage DC. It’s
not for anything that requires a lot of current, because the wire you use isn’t
large enough to carry much current.
To wire wrap, you need
 Perf board: You attach the components to this board. You can use a
bare (no copper) board or one that has component pads for soldering.
We personally prefer the padded board.
 Wire-wrap sockets for ICs and other parts: These sockets have extra-
long metal posts. You wrap the wire around these posts.
 Tie posts: These posts serve as common connection points for attaching
components together.
247
Chapter 11: Creating Your Own Breadboard Circuit
Making circuit boards with plug-’n’-play ICs
You may want to consider this idea when you
build circuit boards that include integrated cir-
cuits: Instead of soldering the IC directly onto the
board, use an IC socket. You solder the socket
onto the board, and then, when you’re done sol-
dering, you plug in the IC and hit the switch. 
IC sockets come in different shapes and sizes,
to match the integrated circuits they’re meant
to work with. For example, if you have a 16-pin
integrated circuit, choose a 16-pin socket.
Here are some good reasons for using sockets:
 Soldering a circuit board can generate
static. You can avoid ruining CMOS or other
static-sensitive integrated circuits by sol-
dering to the socket rather than the actual IC.
 ICs are often one of the first things to go bad
when you’re experimenting with electron-
ics. The ability to pull out a bad chip and
replace it with a working one makes trou-
bleshooting a whole lot easier.
 You can share an expensive part, such as a
microcontroller, among several circuits.
Just pull the part out of one socket and plug
it into another.
Sockets are available in all sizes to match the
different pin arrangements of integrated cir-
cuits. They don’t cost much — just a couple of
pennies for each socket.

 Wire-wrap wire: The wire comes pre-cut or in spools. We prefer pre-cut
wire, but try both before you form an opinion.
 Wire-wrapping tool: You only have to use this specific tool to wrap wire
around a post and remove it. The tool also includes an insulation strip-
per; use this, not a regular wire stripper, to remove the insulation from
wire-wrap wire. 
Though you can wire wrap directly to resistor, capacitor, diode, and other
component leads, most people prefer using wire-wrap sockets. The reason?
Most components have round leads. A wire-wrap socket has square posts.
The square shape helps to bite into the wire, keeping things in place. If you
wrap directly to component leads, you may want to tack on a little bit of
solder to keep the wire in place.
Here’s the basic process for wire wrapping:
1. Insert a socket into the perf board.
If the board has solder pads, touch a little solder between one of the
pads and the post sticking through it. This dab of solder keeps the
socket from coming out.
2. Repeat Step 1 to insert all the other sockets that you may need.
3. Use the wire-wrap tool to connect components together.
4. Plug the ICs and other components into their sockets.
A big advantage of wire wrapping is that you can make changes relatively
easily. Simply unwrap the wire and re-route it to another post. If the wire gets
cruddy, just replace it with a new one.
There’s more to wire wrapping than we can cover here. If it sounds like a
method you think would be useful to you, do an Internet search on “wire wrap-
ping techniques” (include the quotes for more specific results). You can find
numerous Web sites that help you become an expert wire wrapper-upper, such
as http://www.me.umn.edu/courses/me2011/robot/wrap/wrap.html or

you hold up your very own custom-made circuit board, and say “I made this!”
To begin with, in this chapter, you discover just what makes up a circuit board.
The electronic construction technique of choice for many is the printed circuit
board, or PCB. There are a number of ways to build a custom printed circuit
board for your project. This chapter details several methods, including direct
etch, photo transfer, and laser film transfer. We also give you tips about how to
use a computer to speed up your work.

Anatomy of a Circuit Board
Before we get into how to make a printed circuit board, we take a closer look
at what makes up the typical PCB:
 You make a printed circuit board by gluing a very thin sheet of copper
over a plastic, epoxy, or phenolic base. This copper sheet is called
cladding and represents the foil side of the board. We show an example
of this bit of copper in Figure 12-1. It looks pretty boring because here
it’s just a blank canvas. It can become almost anything at this point.
 To make the final board, you etch away specific portions of the copper,
leaving just the printed circuit design. We talk about the exact methods
of laying out the circuit and etching the board in more detail in the sec-
tion “Showing You My Etchings: Etching the Circuit Board,” later in this
chapter.
 You produce the circuit with pads and traces:
• Pads: These contact points for components are generally round 
or rectangular in shape (these are called “donuts” in electronics
parlance). After you etch the circuit board, you drill a hole in the
center of each pad. You mount the components on the top of the
board with their leads poking through the holes. You then solder
each component lead to the board at the board’s pads.
• Traces: These wires of the circuit board run between the pads to
electrically connect the components together. See Figure 12-2 for
an example of traces.
 Printed circuit boards can be either single- or double-sided:
• Single-sided boards are copper clad on only one of their sides. You
mount the components on the other side.
• Double-sided boards are copper clad on both sides; you often use
these boards when you’re working with a very complex circuit. It’s
hard to make your own double-sided PCBs, but you can design
them and have them made for you. We tell you more about PCB
manufacturers in the last part of this chapter.
More advanced circuit boards have multiple layers. An insulating covering
keeps the layers from shorting out. Multi-layer circuit boards are way beyond
what most people can make on their own, so we just mention them here and
go on our merry way.

How the Copper Gets onto the Circuit
There’s more than one way to skin a cat, and there’s more than one approach
to building a circuit board. To begin with, you can use a number of methods
to form the pads and traces that ultimately turn a sheet of copper into a bona
fide PCB.
Here’s how most commercial manufacturers make circuit boards. While you
may not create your own circuit boards in the same way, it’s helpful to know
how the process is typically done
1. First, they coat the copper with a light-sensitive chemical layer called
the sensitizer, also known as resist or photoresist.
2. Next they place an exact-size film negative of the circuit board layout
drawing over the copper clad and expose it.
Just as in processing a photograph, they expose the negative by bathing
the board in light, in this case, strong ultraviolet light. The light passes
through the negative and strikes the sensitized copper underneath.
3. After exposing the board, they dip it in a resist developer (this is
messy stuff but a necessary part of the process).
What comes out from the developer is a copper-clad board where the
portions of the copper that weren’t exposed to light have turned black
or a dark gray. As a point of reference, they often refer to this process as
the positive method; the negative method produce blacks or grays on
those areas that are exposed to light.
4. As a final step, they dip the board in etchant solution.
The etchant is a strong acid-like liquid that eats away at the copper. The
black/gray areas resist the action of the etchant, forming the circuit pat-
tern on the board. (You can find more information about etchant and
etching in the section “Showing You My Etchings: Etching the Circuit
Board,” a little later in this chapter.)
You can duplicate this photographic method in your own shop, although the
process takes a lot of time and can cost you a boatload. You can purchase all
the chemicals that you need from specialty electronics supply outfits; check
out the Appendix at the end of this book for a list of sources. However, the
rest of this chapter concentrates on simpler methods that are probably more
up your alley.

Ready, Set: Preparing 
to Build Your Board
As with most things that you do in electronics, a little planning and neatness
count for a lot. Before jumping into actually building a circuit board, you
should know how to choose and prepare materials.
Choosing the right copper clad
Materials that you use to make printed circuit boards come in various forms.
You can buy either single- or double-sided copper clad. Unless you’re making
a double-sided board, stick with single-sided clad. You waste etchant if you
make single-sided boards with double-sided clad, and besides, the double-
sided stuff costs more.
The thickness of cladding also varies. A common thickness is 1 ounce per
square foot. That’s about 35 micrometers, or a little less than half the thick-
ness of a human hair. You don’t need to worry about the exact thickness of
the clad with most hobby circuits, except when you’re using high voltages or
currents. For most of the circuits that you build, you can opt for just about
any cladding thickness that you want. But remember that if you get it too
thick, you just use up the etchant faster.
The thickness of the board material that you’re cladding also varies. A G-10
grade board, with the standard thickness of 0.062 inch, is made of epoxy
resin and is perfect for the job. Paper-based phenolic and epoxy resin boards,
usually referred to as FR-2 or FR-3, are flame resistant and cost more. The
temperature and flame-resistant FR-4 and FR-5 grade boards also take a bit
more cash than standard boards. For most hobby uses, just pick the stuff
that takes the least amount of money out of your wallet.
Cutting and cleaning
The board that you use to make your PCB should be only as large as the circuit
layout, no larger. Etching a 5 x 5-inch board that contains only 2 x 3 inches of
circuit space wastes etchant solution and money.
If the board is too large, cut it with a saw. First draw or scribe a line in the
copper to ensure a straight cut. You can then smooth the edges of the board
with a file or fine-grit sandpaper. Wear eye protection and a face mask to keep
the dust from the circuit board out of your eyes, nose, and mouth.

No matter what circuit-making process you use, be sure that you completely
clean the copper before you apply any chemicals to it. Dirt and grease foul
up the etching process. Scrub the copper, using a non-metallic scouring pad
(such as the one in Figure 12-3), and a household cleansing powder. Scrub for
a minute or two to remove all grease, dirt, and oxidation.
Figure 12-3:
The copper

254
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
Going surplus
You can sometimes find surplus copper clad
that’s a cut-off or a remnant from a larger piece
used in the electronics industry. This stuff works
perfectly well, though it may be grimy or dirty.
You may find such surplus scraps if you have an
electronics company nearby. Most of those
folks just throw this stuff away. Or, you can buy
the clad surplus from surplus suppliers. Check
out the Appendix for leads on some good mail-
order surplus suppliers for electronics.
You probably have to cut your PCB pieces down
to size if you buy them as surplus scraps. Use a
sharp metal shear to cut the board to size,
rather than a saw. The reason? Most PCBs use
an epoxy and fiberglass base; when you cut the
base, fine dust particles from the fiberglass float
in the air. These fiberglass particles can irritate
your eyes and nose. No matter what tool you
use, if you must cut circuit board pieces to size,
wear eye protection and a respirator mask.

When you have the copper really clean, the water should form a smooth
sheet on the surface, not bead up like water on a newly-waxed car.
Creating a PCB Photographically
The easiest way to make a printed circuit board is to use a pre-printed tem-
plate, such as those templates that you find in some electronics magazines and
books. You can photograph these templates and copy them to acetate film.
In the following sections, we explain some of the considerations and proce-
dures that you use to turn existing artwork into a circuit board. Here is an
overview of the process you use to make a printed circuit board using the
photographic method (it is quite similar to the process the manufacturing
pros follow, described above in “ How the Copper Gets onto the Circuit”: 
 Prepare a mask of the circuit layout and transfer it onto clear transpar-
ent film. This is done using a variety of methods, as described in the sec-
tions that follow.
 Use the mask to expose a sheet of sensitized copper to strong ultraviolet
light. 
 Dip the sensitized, exposed sheet into a developer chemical. This pro-
duces a pattern (called a resist pattern) of the circuit board layout. The
pattern matches what was exposed through the mask.
 Submerge the copper sheet into a tray of etchant. The etchant effec-
tively washes off the copper everywhere except under the resist pattern.
Making the mask
Using the photographic method, once you make a photographic positive or
negative of the original artwork you then use this photographic copy as a mask
to expose an image of the PCB onto a piece of photosensitized copper (you
learn more about this in the section “Positively or Negatively Sensitized?”). 
So your first step is to decide if you want to make a positive photographic
copy of the artwork or a negative copy. You make the copy on a thick film,
like the film in a 35mm camera (only larger and without the holes!):
 A negative inverts the polarity of the image; black areas become clear,
and white areas become black.
 A positive retains the polarity of the image; black areas remain black,
and white areas become clear.

Have a local printer produce a photo negative or positive of the original art-
work that you find in a magazine or book. It costs about $10 or so, but it can
really help when you have to make multiple copies of a circuit board.
As an alternative, you can try making a positive mask with a sheet of trans-
parency film. The local copy shop can probably do a better job (they get
deeper, darker blacks) than your printer at home. If you photocopy the origi-
nal onto transparency film, be sure to avoid any sizing errors. Many copiers
automatically apply a 1- to 2-percent enlargement, and this size change can
slightly alter the dimensions of the solder pad and hole spacings. Be sure to
get an exact 1:1 copy.
If you take the artwork to a print shop, they can usually make a negative for
less money than a positive because fewer steps are involved. When you make a
photocopy onto transparency film, you always get a positive image. Whether
you use negative or positive art, be sure to select the proper sensitizer and
developer to match. More about this stuff in the section “Positively or
Negatively Sensitized,” immediately following.
Creating the film has two most important aspects: The black areas need to be
completely black and filled in, and any thin lines in the circuit can’t break up.
Closely inspect the film under a bright, even light to look for imperfections.
Sometimes, you can just fill in the missing black areas with a Sharpie® or simi-
lar marking pen.
Positively or negatively sensitized
We made a bit of a fuss about making a positive or negative in the previous sec-
tion. Here’s where it matters: You have to be sure to use the right kind of sensi-
tized copper clad or sensitizer (also called photoresist) spray to match the
artwork that you’re using. The sensitizer, whether the manufacturer already
applied it to the board, or you spray it on, is what makes the copper “pick up”
the pattern from the artwork. 
256
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
The art of layout drawings and schematics
Although both layout drawings and schematics
are representations of a circuit, there are dif-
ferences. A schematic shows the components
of the circuit and what connections run among
them. A layout drawing essentially shows the
traces you use to make the connections that are
called for on the schematic. While all the con-
nections are shown in a schematic as lines, the
lines and components don’t accurately reflect
the physical layout on a final board. In a layout
drawing, these connections are shown as they
will actually appear on the board.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Most circuit board layouts in magazines and books are designed as film posi-
tives where the black portions represent areas that contain resist, and the
etchant washes away the white areas.
If you make a film positive to use as the mask, you must use a positive-acting
sensitizer. When you expose the board to light, the dark part of the artwork
stops anything underneath it from being exposed. When you dip the board
into the developer, the unexposed portions take on a darkish coating of the
resist. When etched, the part of the board under this resist remains. The rest
of the board is removed, because there is nothing protecting the copper.
Conversely, a negative-acting sensitizer turns the clear areas of the artwork
into resist. You end up with a board that matches the mask, as long as the art-
work and sensitizer/developer match, positive-wise or negative-wise.
You can buy sensitizer solution that you spray onto ordinary copper clad
boards. Or, you can buy boards that come already sensitized, which is a lot
easier. You can tell they’re sensitized because they come in black plastic bag-
gies. Boards that somebody else sensitizes cost you more, but the time sav-
ings are worth it.
You also need a developer that’s compatible with the type of sensitizer that
you’re using. When you buy sensitizer spray, the manufacturer usually pack-
ages the correct developer with it. Be sure to not mix a positive sensitizer
with a negative developer, or your board pattern won’t come out correctly.
Mirror, mirror on the PCB
Okay, one more thing to be careful about: Be sure that you transfer the layout
to the board with the proper orientation. Reversing the layout makes a
mirror-image of the board, leaving you with a pretty useless circuit board. If
you reverse the layout, the connections for any integrated circuits are back-
wards; at best, the circuit just doesn’t work, and at worst, it can burn out
components. Spend some time thinking about how the layout transfers to the
copper clad, and be sure that you don’t reverse the layout.
Preparing the PCB for etching
After you make a mask and sensitize the copper clad (or purchase pre-
sensitized copper), you’re ready to actually make the printed circuit board.

Here’s what you do to make the board:
1. In a darkened room (remember, this is a photographic process so you
need to work in the dark!), spray a coating of sensitizer onto a clean
copper-clad board.
2. Place the film over the sensitized board and insert both in a suitable
exposure holder, like the picture frame in Figure 12-4.
To be really fancy, you can get photographic holders at a photography
shop, but picture frames work just as well.
3. Note the orientation of the film and correct it, if necessary.
Make sure that you haven’t reversed the film, or you may etch the board
with a mirror-image of the circuit layout. Checking the film’s position
requires some thought on your part, so don’t rush through it.

4. Place the film negative so that the emulsion (the dull side) faces the
copper clad. This step helps produce a sharper image on the board.
Note, however, that you may need to reverse the film (emulsion side
facing out) if the original artwork that you’re copying from a printed
magazine or book is reversed. Some magazines print circuit artwork in
reverse (called left-reading), to make it easier for them to transfer the
image using the dry toner transfer method, described in the section,
“Creating a PCB By Using the Transfer Film Method,” later in the chapter.
Let there be light: Exposing 
and developing the board
You can expose the sensitized board in a number of ways. If the sun is out
and about, you can expose the board to its ultraviolet rays. Exposure time
varies between just a few minutes to over 15 minutes. The many makes and
brands of photoresist require different exposure times, so check the instruc-
tion sheet that came with the photoresist that you’re using.
You can reduce exposure time by using an ultraviolet tanning lamp. Place the
lamp a foot or two away from the board so that the light falls evenly on the
board. Don’t put the lamp so close that the edges of the board are in shadow.
Remember that UV tanning lamps give off ultraviolet rays, so don’t expose
yourself to these rays for long periods, unless you actually enjoy the stinging
sensation of sunburn! Also, wear tanning bed goggles that keep the UV rays
from entering your eyes to avoid permanent damage to your retinas. Better
yet, don’t use an ultraviolet lamp. Wait for a sunny day and expose the board
in the great outdoors.

Which end is up? (Or down or left or right?)
If you want to make sure that you orient the film
properly, try this approach. Look at the compo-
nent layout diagram that you can usually find
printed with the circuit layout. This diagram
shows where you should place each component
on the board. The shaded portions of the com-
ponent layout diagram show where the pads and
traces are located on the underside of the board.
Now look at the film and orient it to match the
shading of the component layout diagram. Most
boards aren’t symmetrical, so you can easily tell
the left side from the right side. Place the sensi-
tized board into its exposure holder. Finally, flip
the film over (left to right) and place it over the
board.

After you expose the board, you have to develop it in a suitable developing
solution. Mix the developer according to the instructions the manufacturer
included with the package. After you mix it, pour the developer into a shallow
plastic tray — the kind you find at a photography store is perfect. Place the
exposed board into the developer liquid. Developing times vary from one
manufacturer to another. Follow the solution manufacturer’s recommended
times for developing.
After developing, you’re ready to etch the board, which we detail in the sec-
tion titled “Showing You My Etchings: Etching the Circuit Board,” later in this
chapter.
Creating a PCB by Using the 
Transfer Film Method
The photographic method that we describe in the previous section requires
that you use sensitized copper clad, a negative (or a positive), and exposure
to ultraviolet light. All in all, this process means a lot of fuss if you’re making
a slew of boards.
If you plan on making just one or two circuit boards from pre-printed artwork,
you may want to consider the transfer film method. The transfer film method
involves nothing more than a sheet of clear acetate — the type used for over-
head transparencies — and a plain paper copier or laser printer.
When you copy the artwork onto the transparency, it fuses black toner onto
the acetate sheet. You transfer the toner from the transparency to the copper
clad using the heat from a clothes iron. The toner provides an effective resist
to the etchant solution that you use to dissolve unwanted copper from the
circuit board. Although the method may seem anything but high-tech, it works
quite well.
Although overhead transparency acetate works as a transfer film medium,
you get better overall results if you use transfer film specifically designed for
the job. Check out the Appendix at the back of this book for a list of several
online resources that sell transfer film designed for making printed circuit
boards.
You need a plain paper copier or printer in top-notch working condition, oth-
erwise the image that the transfer film records turns out gray and grainy. If
you don’t have such a copier nearby, take your printed circuit board artwork
to your local copy center. Many neighborhood copy shops use state-of-the-art
high speed plain paper copiers that produce jet-black images on clear acetate
film. We think the few extra pennies that you spend are well worth it.
260

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

By the way, some copiers require that you use acetate sheets with a leading
white strip. The copier uses this strip to sense when a piece of paper feeds
through critical parts of the machine. Without the strip, the acetate may jam.
Before buying a box of transparency film for your copier, verify what kind 
of film your copier works with. Most stationery stores don’t let you return
opened boxes of copier supplies.
Flip-flop, flop-flip
As with the photographic method, which you can read about in the section
“Creating a PCB Photographically,” earlier in this chapter, you need to make
sure that you have the circuit board image oriented the right way. The art-
work must be right-reading, meaning it shouldn’t be reversed left-to-right.
You have to again reverse original artwork that you get from a book or maga-
zine that the publishers already reversed once (left-reading, or mirror image).
You can verify that you have the correct orientation by
 Using a plain paper copier that can reverse the image. Some of the top
copier models have this feature.
 Making one copy of the artwork onto the transfer film and then turn-
ing the film over and using it to make a second copy. Place a piece of
white paper behind the transfer film for a clean background. This method
isn’t ideal, but it works in a pinch.
You can tell if the image is right- or left-reading by looking at the text that
accompanies the PCB layout. The image is right-reading if the text appears
normally. If the text appears backwards, the image is left-reading.
Getting a good image
After you copy the artwork to the transfer film, look carefully for washed-out
areas or areas where toner hasn’t completely adhered. Gently touch it with a
soft tissue to make sure the toner is firmly bonded to the sheet. Some copiers
don’t fuse toner well to overhead transparency film. If you find out that your
copier can’t cut the transparency-film mustard, try a different copier which
may have a higher heat setting.
If the image looks good, protect the transparency by covering it with a blank
sheet of paper. If you accidentally scrape toner off the film, you can cause a
void in the printed circuit.

Transferring the layout to copper clad
After going through the steps in the previous two sections, you’re ready to
transfer the toner from the transparency to the copper clad of the printed cir-
cuit board.
Follow these steps to prepare the board:
1. First, clean the board thoroughly by using a household cleanser, such
as Ajax or Comet, and a sponge. After cleaning be sure to not touch
the copper. Handle the board by the edges only.
Be absolutely sure there is no oil or dirt on the board. The copper should
be bright and shiny.
2. Place the PCB copper-side up on an ironing board.
3. Cut the transfer film to size so that it’s not larger than the board.
4. Carefully place the transfer film over the board so that the toner side
faces the copper clad.
5. Secure the film into place with some strips of masking tape, but don’t
tape over toner areas.
6. Place a small piece of cheese cloth or several layers of paper towel
over the PCB and transfer film. (Cheese cloth is a thin cotton material
you can get in the housewares aisle of your nearby department or gro-
cery store. You can also use plain white paper towels (no pretty pastel
flowers printed on them, please).
Now, it’s time to transfer the artwork to the board. If you’re using transfer
sheets specifically designed for making PCBs, refer to the instructions that
come with the transfer sheet.
The following steps provide general recommendations for the best way to
transfer if you’re using ordinary transparency film:
1. Set your clothes iron to cotton-linen or medium-high heat.
2. Let the iron warm up and then apply the iron to the board. Move the
iron back and forth in slow, even strokes, as if you’re ironing your
very best shirt.
Be careful to keep the cheese cloth or towel flat to avoid wrinkles.
3. Apply steady and firm pressure for 15 to 20 seconds (see Figure 12-5).
4. Wait 10 to 15 seconds, then gently lift the cloth. 
262
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

5. Carefully peel back a small corner of the film to see if the toner has
transferred to the copper clad.
6. If the toner hasn’t completely transferred to the copper, replace the
film and apply the iron for another 15 to 20 seconds.
You have to experiment with the exact time to achieve proper toner transfer.
It may take as little as 15 seconds or as long as a minute. Don’t try to speed
things up by increasing the temperature setting of the iron. This increase
makes the transparency film wilt, causing a distorted transfer of the circuit
layout.
Be sure to QC (Quality 
Control) your work!
After you’ve transferred the toner, wait for the film to cool. If it’s hot to the
touch, leave it for a minute or two. Then gently remove the spent film and
discard it; you can’t use it again.

263
Chapter 12: Building Your Own Printed Circuit Boards
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Carefully inspect the pattern on the copper clad. The toner should be well
adhered with few, if any, voids. Use a magnifying glass (3x or 4x) to get a
close-up view. If you see voids or skips, fill them in with a fine-tipped resist
pen, which you can find at most electronics stores, or with a Sharpie®. The
pen uses a jet-black ink that resists the action of the etching solution.
You may find that you need to press the toner into the copper clad using a
small wooden or rubber roller. The pressure of the roller helps fuse the toner
to the copper. We have had good success with a wooden wallpaper seam
roller, such as the one in Figure 12-6. Be careful to burnish the toner onto the
copper with a rolling action, not a scraping action, or you may scratch off the
circuit layout.
You now have the board ready for etching, which you can find out about in
the section “Showing You My Etchings: Etching the Circuit Board,” later in
this chapter.
Choosing a Method for Making 
Your Own Circuit Layouts
Can’t find any artwork on which you want to base your circuit board? You’re
probably glad to hear that you can also make a printed circuit board com-
pletely from scratch.

You can try two popular methods for making a board from scratch:
 The direct-etch method: With this method, you apply the resist directly
to the copper clad. Dry transfer direct-etch kits, such as those made by
Datak, provide pads for ICs and other components, as well as spools of
thin black tape for the traces. Refer to the Appendix for Web sites that
sell dry transfer kits. You apply the resist just like you make signs, using
dry transfer lettering. The direct-etch method is practical for designs
where you want to make just one board.
 Draw the layout: You can use a computer and plotter, ink pen, or other
method to draw your layout and then use that drawing as a master to
make one or more PCBs. The master is essentially a film negative or posi-
tive that you use to expose the surface of the sensitized copper clad.
You can buy pre-sensitized boards or apply the sensitizer to a standard
board with a brush or spray can. Exposure typically requires a strong
short-wave ultraviolet light source, such as a tanning lamp.
Showing You My Etchings: 
Etching the Circuit Board
Creating the resist pattern on a new sheet of printed circuit board material,
as we describe in the section “Making Your Own Circuit Layouts,” earlier in
this chapter, really only gets your board one third of the way done. For the
next step, you need to etch that board to remove the unwanted copper. The
copper that remains forms the printed circuit that makes your project work.
You use something called etchant to etch your board. Etchant is a caustic
(meaning it can burn you) chemical that dissolves copper. It’s not like some
acid that a monster in a B-movie oozes out dissolving everything in its path;
etchant doesn’t fizzle away the copper on contact. The etching process actu-
ally takes several minutes. The copper that the resist pattern doesn’t protect
dissolves away first. The etchant finishes its job when it gets rid of all the
copper in the exposed, resist-free areas.
(The final third of the PCB-making process involves drilling the holes for the
components, which we cover in the section “Final Prep and Drilling,” later in
this chapter.)
First step: Inspecting the board
Think of etching as an unforgiving process. In the steps leading up to this
process, you can modify or redo your work, to a certain extent. But when you
reach the etching stage, you’re making a commitment: After you etch, if you
265
Chapter 12: Building Your Own Printed Circuit Boards
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

have an error in your circuit, you probably have to chuck the whole thing and
start again.
That’s why you really, really need to inspect the board for errors in layout,
missing traces and pads, skips in the resist pattern, and other gremlins that
produce a poor result before you actually etch the board:
 If you created the resist pattern from artwork appearing in a book or
magazine, compare your board with the printed layout. Follow the traces
from pad to pad and note any discrepancies. If you find any, you’ll have
to redo the artwork or fix any problems before you begin etching.
 If you created the resist pattern from your own design, or by using the
direct-etch method, carefully review your work and compare it against a
schematic or paper drawing. Be sure that pads and traces aren’t too
close together. At a minimum, all pads and traces should be 1⁄32nd of an
inch apart, but more is always better here.
Repairing a board after a shoddy etching job — if you can do it at all — is
time-consuming and frustrating.
Cleaning the board — carefully, please!
After you inspect the board, wet a cotton ball with isopropyl alcohol and
gently clean the exposed parts. Don’t apply much alcohol because some
types of resist may melt or distort when exposed to alcohol. Also, let the
alcohol dry completely before immersing the board in the etchant fluid.
Use isopropyl alcohol with a minimal water content. General purpose isopropyl
alcohol that you buy at the drug store can have 30- to 40-percent water con-
tent. The more water mixed in with the alcohol, the more chance you have
that the water will damage the resist. Look for so-called technical grade iso-
propyl alcohol, available at chemical supply outlets and school lab suppliers.
Kvetching about etching
Etching can be dangerous — not only to your health, but also to your ward-
robe. Most circuit board etchants, whether in liquid or powder form, are
toxic and highly caustic. Never allow the etchant chemical to come into con-
tact with your skin or your clothes. If you do get some etchant on your fin-
gers or hands, wash it off immediately.
266
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Because etchant stains skin and clothing, avoid wearing your best party
clothes when etching. Instead, wear a smock, your least favorite pair of pants,
and old shoes. Also, wear eye protection to prevent the etchant from injuring
your peepers if it splashes onto your face.
Wear gloves to protect your hands against burns and stains. Choose gloves
that let you work almost as well as if you didn’t have gloves on at all. (So don’t
use those old gardening gloves for this kind of work.) Disposable plastic or
latex gloves do a good job.
Prolonged exposure to etching solution fumes can seriously injure you, so 
be sure to etch your circuit boards only in a well-ventilated area. All etchant
solutions give off fumes, which can do serious harm to the mucous mem-
branes in your nose and throat. You don’t necessarily notice the effect right
away. You may etch one or two boards and not be aware of the fumes. But an
hour or two later, you feel an intense burning in your nose or throat that can
last up to several days.
Store unused etchant solution in a dark-colored plastic bottle designed for
photographic chemicals and keep the bottle in a dry, dark, cool place. Clearly
label the bottle with its contents and keep it away from children.
Mixing the etchant
If the previous section didn’t scare you away from ever touching etchant,
even with a ten foot pole, check out this section for the mad scientist portion
of the process — mixing the etchant.
267
Chapter 12: Building Your Own Printed Circuit Boards
Types of etchant chemicals
Perhaps the most common etchant chemical for
making printed circuit boards is ferric chloride.
You can buy it in both liquid and concentrated
dry (or paste) form. The liquid often comes
already diluted and ready for use. But you will
have to dilute dry powder or paste in water. We
recommend the concentrated form because
you can mix it with hot water. The hotter the
water, the faster the etching process. (But never
exceed 135 degrees Fahrenheit or else the
chemical may bubble and get all riled up, and
splash over you and everything near you.)
Ammonium persulfate is gaining in popularity as
a PCB etchant. It is available in both liquid and
crystal form. Folks in the know about chemicals
and safety generally consider ammonium per-
sulfate safer than ferric chloride, though both
chemicals are toxic. Handle both with extreme
care.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You find etchant, whether ferric chloride or ammonium persulfate, in three
popular forms:
 Liquid, not concentrated
 Liquid, concentrated
 Powder (sometimes this comes as a semi-glutinous paste)
You can get liquid, unconcentrated etchant at Radio Shack and most electron-
ics stores. It comes in a plastic bottle ready for use. Just open the bottle,
pour the etchant solution into a plastic (remember, never metal) tray, and
you’re ready to go.
You can use unconcentrated liquid etchant to make more than one board,
depending on the size of the boards. The etching action reduces as you
increase the surface area of the board.
For example, if the board measures 4 x 6 inches, with one side to etch, the
board has 24 square inches of copper clad. Check the bottle for your etchant’s
recommended usage. Your particular solution may be able to etch up to 50
square inches of copper clad. This estimate assumes that you use the entire
contents of the bottle. If you use less etchant, you also reduce the expected
amount of coverage.
The size and number of boards that you make determines how long the
etchant lasts before it just can’t etch anymore. You need to throw out weaker
etchants after you use them to make just one 2 x 3-inch board; you can use
stronger etchants to make several large boards. Using weak etchant, you may
have to wait ages for the etching to finish, and this weak etchant can lead to
voids in the copper pattern.
268
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
Talking of trays and tongs
No matter what type of etching solution you use,
always pour it into plastic containers. Avoid all
metals because the etchant reacts with them.
Be sure that the stopper or cap for your con-
tainers aren’t metal, either, and that they don’t
have any metal parts inside.
You mix certain types of etchant with warm
water. While stirring, chemical reaction heats up
the etchant even more, so be sure to use a plas-
tic tray that can hold very hot water. Process-
ing trays for photography generally make ideal
etching troughs. For safety, check the tray before
you use it: Fill it with hot (150 to 180 degree)
water. The tray shouldn’t become soft or melt.
For best results, a tray should have ripples or
ridges on the bottom. This texture allows the
etchant solution to flow freely under the board
while the board stews in the tray. Finally, you
need two plastic or bamboo tongs to handle the
board. Don’t use your fingers! You can buy
these tongs at any photographic or arts supply
store.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Here are some tips to keep in mind when mixing and using etchants for
making printed circuit boards:
 You must dilute concentrated liquid etchant before you use it. For best
results, dilute the etchant with hot water; this addition increases the
etching action. Typical dilution ratios are 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1. The higher the
ratio, the longer the concentrate lasts. For best results, though, balance
the thrifty use of the concentrate with your tolerance for longer etching
times. The weaker the etchant, the longer it takes to remove the excess
copper.
 You have to mix powder (or paste) etchant before you use it. One packet
of powder etchant generally makes one or two quarts of unconcentrated
etchant. You can mix the powder to make a smaller amount of liquid and
then dilute the mixture when you’re ready to use it.
Now that you’re itching to etch . . .
After you go through all the preliminaries in the preceding sections, you get
to actually etch your printed circuit board.
Follow these steps to etch the board:
1. Pour the etchant into the plastic tray carefully, avoiding spills and
splashes.
Pour enough etchant to create a pool at least 1⁄8-inch thick, preferably 
1⁄4-inch thick.
2. Dunk the board into the tray and continually rock it back and forth.
3. Keep the board in the soup for 10 to 30 minutes (depending on the
type and strength of the etchant) or until the etchant has removed all
the excess copper. Keep that tray a-rockin — but gently! 
4. Use the plastic or wooden tongs to lift the board out of the tray from
time to time to check progress.
The etchant removes the copper, starting from the edges and areas close to
the resist. Large, open areas of copper can be stubborn and take 2 to 3 times
as long to etch completely. You may want to agitate those areas of the copper
that don’t respond as quickly to the etchant. However, be sure that you don’t
over-agitate because you can undercut the copper under the resist. Under-
cutting happens when etchant oozes under the resist and attacks the copper
that you don’t want to remove.
269
Chapter 12: Building Your Own Printed Circuit Boards

Final Prep and Drilling
If you’ve gone through the steps earlier in this chapter, you’ve almost created
your first finished board. But before you turn off your work light for the night,
you have one more phase to handle: you have to do final prep and drilling of
the circuit board.
The etchant has completed etching when you can’t see any traces of exposed
copper. Assuming that you did the etching process correctly, the copper
under the resist should remain intact. Still, the black resist for the traces and
component pads remains, so first you have some clean-up duties to perform.
After etching, rinse the board under cold running water for 15 to 20 seconds.
Be sure to rinse the etchant from the back side of the board, as well.
After you clean the board, follow these steps to prepare and drill it:
1. Remove the resist with lacquer thinner or thoroughly scrub the board
with a non-metallic scouring pad and cleaner.
We regularly use Ajax® cleanser and green Scotchbrite™ scouring pads.
When you’ve completely removed the resist, the copper should be
bright and shiny, with no evidence of undercutting.
2. If you find that the board was over-etched and it’s missing some of the
traces, you can repair the board by soldering short lengths of wire to
bridge the gaps or by applying copper tape to the missing portions.
You can find a variety of copper tape and pads to make or repair PCBs.
Check out the Appendix for a list of several online sites that carry
printed circuit board–making products. The copper pieces have adhe-
sive backing that you use to fix them to the board.
3. Drill the board using a small 0.040” or 0.070” drill; we recommend
the smaller drill for IC sockets and small resistors and capacitors.
270
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
Etchant, be gone!
Diluted etchant solution that you use for hobby-
ist applications usually doesn’t pose a serious
threat to plumbing, but the etchant is a pollutant
and a toxin. Take the exhausted etchant to a
licensed recycler or approved chemical waste
disposal site. If you live near an electronics
manufacturer, you may be able to get them to
dispose of it for you. Because they can reclaim
copper from exhausted etchant solution, the
company may not charge you for this service.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

We also recommend a small drill press, like the one you see in Figure
12-7, or a drilling stand. For best results, keep most of the bit tucked
inside the drill motor chuck. With only 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch protruding from the
chuck, you have less chance of breaking or bending the bit. If you’re in
doubt about how to use your drill or drill press, check the instructions
that came with it!
4. Position the drill exactly within the hole on each pad. If a component
pad doesn’t have a hole, drill in the approximate center of the pad.
Most components don’t require precision drilling, but with some — most
notably, ICs — you must drill the hole within about 1⁄50 of an inch of the
proper spot. If the drill bit dances around the copper foil before it digs in,
use a center punch to make a small dimple in the board. The dimple helps
you aim the bit at the exact spot that you want for the hole.
5. After drilling, inspect the copper for burrs and remove them with an
emery board or fine steel wool.
6. Examine the back of the board for chips and cracks; remove broken
pieces of epoxy and file away the rough spots.
Drill from the foil (copper) side of the board to the back. You can prevent 
splitting and chipping the back of the board by placing a sheet of scrap wood
underneath it, but don’t use particle board because it quickly dulls the drill bit.

One more cleaning duty: Thoroughly wash the board to remove pieces of
copper, epoxy, wood, steel wool, and other contaminants. Use a non-metal
scouring pad (such as 3M Scotchbrite™) and cleanser to thoroughly clean
the copper foil.
You’re now ready to solder the components to your custom-made printed cir-
cuit board. (You can get into the soldering groove by checking out Chapter 8.)
If you don’t plan to use the board for a while, place it in a plastic baggie and
store it in a safe place where it can’t get dirty.
PCBs R Us: Using a PCB Service
What if you don’t want to get your hands dirty making a PCB with the methods
that we describe in the earlier sections of this chapter, but you still want to
permanently mount that circuit? Just have a company that makes PCBs for a
living make one or two (or a hundred) for you.
Now you’re a board designer
To get a PCB board made by a PCB manufacturer, you first need to generate
the PCB layout. You can generate the layout with Computer Aided Design (or
CAD) software (which we discuss in more detail in the section “Using CAD to
Make Artwork,” later in this chapter). Using CAD software, you generate data
files (called Gerber files), which you then send to the PCB manufacturer. The
manufacturer uses these files to give you a quote, and if you’re okay with the
price, they go ahead and make the board for you.
PCB design is full of rules, just like so many other things in life. Before you
generate Gerber files, check out the manufacturer’s design rules. Design rules
insure that the PCB you want doesn’t require features that the manufacturer’s
equipment and processes can’t handle. The manufacturer checks your files to
see that they meet the design rules (this once-over is called a design rule check,
or DRC). Most manufacturers probably won’t do the job until you correct any
design rule errors.
Common design rules require that you maintain a certain minimum
 Trace width
 Space between traces
 Space between a trace and the outside of a board
 Pad size
272
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

The list above doesn’t cover everything, so be sure to check the manufac-
turer’s Web site for their complete design rules.
A word to the wise: Some PCB vendors offer the option of getting boards at a
lower price by skipping the silk screen and solder mask steps. Silk screening
puts ink letters and numbers on the board for specific purposes, such as
marking the hole into which you should solder resistor R3. Solder mask is a
green film that protects the traces on the board if you get a little sloppy and
spill solder where you shouldn’t. Generally, we recommend getting your
board made with silk screening and the solder mask: These features are worth
the few extra dollars that you spend because they help you keep track of
components and protect your board.
PCBs: Everybody’s doing it (But 
will they do it for you?)
There is no shortage of companies that manufacture PCBs; the tricky part
comes when you have to find ones that take orders for anywhere from one to
a handful of boards from a hobbyist for a reasonable price.
We point out some manufacturers that fit this criterion, but we suggest that
you compare prices among manufacturers when you’re ready to buy. You can
do a search using Google or your favorite search engine for “printed circuit
board manufacturer” and compare prices by visiting the Web sites that the
search engine finds for you.
As of this writing, we recommend that you take a look at these three 
manufacturers:
 Olimex: To obtain a board at a low cost, try Olimex (www.olimex.com).
The only drawback to Olimex is that they have longer shipping times
than other manufacturers because they’re not-so-conveniently located 
in Bulgaria.
 AP Circuits: If you can’t wait the few weeks it takes to ship products
from Europe, try AP Circuits (www.apcircuits.com). Although their
prices aren’t quite as low as Olimex, they’re reasonable. And if you’re 
in the US or Canada, you’re looking at a much shorter shipping time.
 Advanced Circuits: If you’re a college student, you may want to check
out Advanced Circuits (www.4pcb.com). They waive their minimum
order requirement for college students, allowing you to order one board
for the same price per board that the rest of us pay when ordering three
boards. Who says education doesn’t pay off?

Using CAD to Make Artwork
You use Computer Aided Design programs to make layout art for PCB boards.
These programs contain libraries of symbols for common components and
templates, and they include tools for creating drawings. They provide several
features that help turn your ideas into polished drawings.
You can buy sophisticated CAD programs for hundreds or thousands of dol-
lars (and you may have to be a rocket scientist to use some of them); or, you
can download freeware or shareware CAD programs. Some of these are pretty
simple to use. Do a Google search for “CAD software for PCB design,” and you
can find several software packages.
The program that we recommend is Eagle Light from CadSoft. You can down-
load this program for free at www.cadsoft.de.
What you can do with Eagle Light CAD
Of course, you pay a price for getting things free: The free Eagle Light CAD
program has a few limitations. You can’t use it to draw a board larger than 4
inches by 3.2 inches or one containing more than two layers. If you need to
make a board that exceeds these limitations or are making boards for a profit,
go ahead and fork over the money for the full version of the software (about
$200 for the standard version and $400 for the professional version at the
time of this writing).
You can use Eagle Light software to produce board layout drawings and data
files. These Gerber files contain the data that PCB manufacturers need to
make your custom board. You can also print out the layout drawing and use
it to make the PCB yourself with one of the methods that we cover in the ear-
lier sections in this chapter.
Getting to work designing a board
We suggest that you read the tutorial for Eagle Light on the CadSoft Web site
(www.cadsoft.de) and then do the low-tech thing: Print out the page of the

We won’t kid you: You may have to stumble around a bit the first few times
that you use the software before you get it right. But stick with it, and you
can soon become an Eagle Light master.
To give you an idea of what you can do with a CAD program, we outline the
major steps for using Eagle Light here:
1. Enter your circuit into the CAD software.
Entering your circuit into the software involves steps such as placing sym-
bols for all the components from your circuit into your onscreen layout
and then drawing lines that represent the wires between the appropriate
pins, placing junctions in the appropriate places, and attaching +V and
ground symbols to the appropriate pins.
2. Next, you run an automated electrical rule check (ERC) by clicking the
ERC tool button.
This check catches problems that you may have missed, such as failing
to attach ground to the correct pin of an IC.
3. Correct any errors and run the ERC again.
Figure 12-8 shows a schematic drawn in Eagle Light. (Credit where it’s due:

Philip Gladstone.)

Figure 12-8 shows the complete schematic, but that’s a whole lot of schematic
to take in at once. To show you the details, we zoom into a portion of the
schematic in Figure 12-9.
After you correct any errors, start the process of generating the layout draw-
ing (the layout drawing is the actual artwork that will become your printed
circuit board):
1. Click the Switch To Board tool button.
Eagle Light opens a board window that includes the symbols for each of
the components that you specify in the schematic.
2. Click and drag to place the symbols in the correct position on the
layout drawing.
3. Click the Autorouter button; the program draws traces that corre-
spond to the connections that you indicate in the schematic.
If the Autorouter can’t place all the traces, move some of the components a
bit and try the Autorouter again. For example, the Autorouter may not posi-
tion components placed too close together just right. If this second attempt
doesn’t work, you may have to route some of the traces manually.

Figure 12-10 shows a layout drawing with the traces, pads, vias (vias connect
traces on different layers), and component numbers for the top layer of the
board, based on the schematic in Figure 12-8.
You can see the layout drawing showing the traces, pads, and vias for the
bottom layer of this same board in Figure 12-11. Note that because this is 
the bottom of the board, the text shown in Figure 12-10 is reversed in Fig-
ure 12-11.
After you finish routing the board, run a design rule check (DRC) to make
sure you’ve properly drawn the board and avoided violating any design 
rules. Eagle Light then asks you to check the design rules against the 
manufacturer’s.
The default design rules built into Eagle Light often work just fine, but go
ahead and check against the PCB manufacturer’s rules and make any neces-
sary changes. For example, if the PCB manufacturer has a minimum trace
width of 10 mils and the default in Eagle Light is 8 mils, change the mini-
mum width to 10 mils.

That’s it. Now you’re ready to generate Gerber files from the layout drawing
and send them to the manufacturer. Use the printed circuit board software to
generate the proper files for you. You need to discuss with the PCB manufac-
turer how they prefer to receive files. Some have an automated process where
you submit the files via their Web page, and others are perfectly happy
receiving the files through regular e-mail.
Using the Autorouter feature, rather than manually routing the traces, mini-
mizes the chance of creating any design rule violations.

icrocontrollers are the Eighth Wonder of the World. What makes
microcontrollers so special? Simply put, they’re programmable cir-
cuits. Just like your home computer, you can program them to do whatever
you may want them to do.
Though they may look like ordinary integrated circuits, they have much more
to offer; in fact, microcontrollers have become the way to make the best and
brightest electronic products. Here’s just one example: if you have a car built
within the last 10 years, odds are it uses not one, but a half dozen or more
microcontrollers. Each microcontroller is dedicated to taking care of some
important facet of your driving experience, from the brakes to the electronic
ignition to the air bag system.
We focus on the microcontrollers for the hobbyist in this chapter. Here, you
can discover what microcontrollers are and what they do. In the section
“Getting to Know the BASIC Stamp 2,” near the end of this chapter, we give
you two nifty hands-on demonstrations that you can try yourself to get a
peek at the power of microcontrollers.
So, How Does It Work?
A microcontroller is an integrated circuit chip, which is usually mounted on a
mini-PCB that includes other components in circuits that interface the micro-
controller to your computer, motors, or switches. When you’re programming
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

a microcontroller, you place it on a development board that allows the micro-
controller to interface with your personal computer. Once it’s programmed,
you mount the microcontroller into a socket on your electronic device.
Unlike traditional circuits, you don’t need to swap wires around or pull out
resistors or capacitors and replace them with some other part to change a
microcontroller’s function. Instead, you just alter a couple of lines of pro-
gramming code. The microcontroller seems to take on a different personality,
instantly changing what your project actually does. You can program a single
microcontroller to do any of thousands, of different jobs!
Most microcontrollers are designed for use in commercial products, and you
may find it a bit difficult to program these little guys. Fortunately, some ver-
sions of microcontrollers are specifically for the hobbyist, so you get every-
thing that you need to run the microcontroller on one small circuit board.
You can easily program these hobby-friendly microcontrollers, and they don’t
drain your wallet.
What’s Inside a Microcontroller?
Originally, microcontrollers were designed to provide a way for a personal
computer to communicate with electronic gadgets in the outside world. We
still use them for that purpose, and more.
Here are the parts of a typical microcontroller:
 Small computer: This computer sits at the heart of the microcontroller.
This built-in computer isn’t as powerful as the one on your desk, but
microcontrollers don’t need a ton of horsepower. You expect your desk-
top computer to do several big jobs at once, such as browsing the
Internet, calculating spreadsheets, and fending off viruses. The typical
microcontroller does a single job.
 Non-volatile memory: The microcontroller stores the program that runs
on its computer in non-volatile memory. This memory sticks around
when you turn off the power. The non-volatile memory comes to life the
moment that you connect the batteries and flip the switch.
 Input/output ports: These connections on a microcontroller allow it to
communicate with the real world, running things like lights, motors,
relays, sensors, switches, liquid crystal displays, and even other micro-
controllers. These input/output ports, also called I/O ports, provide
information that allows the chip to control your project. A microcon-
troller program may light up an LED when you flip a switch or run a
motor when a sensor detects someone walking by, for example.
You can see a good example of a microcontroller in action in the brains of the
LEGO Mindstorms robot construction set. The yellow brick that you can see
282
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

in Figure 13-1 contains a small microcontroller chip that can display mes-
sages on a liquid crystal display (LCD), react to switches and other sensors,
and run up to three motors at the same time.
As with all microcontrollers, you program the LEGO Mindstorms’ brain by
sending it programming instructions. First, you create these instructions on
your personal computer, and then you transmit them to the Mindstorms brain
by using an infrared link (most microcontrollers that hobbyists work with use
a wired link that you connect to your PC’s serial or USB port). After you send
instructions to the microcontroller, the instructions reside in non-volatile
memory until you replace them with new instructions. LEGO Mindstorms
gives you a good example of a microcontroller’s ability to play multiple roles;
you just have to modify the software. By changing a few lines of a program, a
LEGO Mindstorms robot can do the following:
 Search for the brightest light in the room, such as a flashlight, and move
toward it.
 Find the brightest light and, instead of approaching it, move away from it.
 React to bumper switches mounted on its sides so that when the robot
hits an obstacle, it backs up and goes the other way.
 Sense a black line on a piece of white construction paper and follow it.
The LEGO Mindstorms, like the little robot in Figure 13-2, can also follow a
combination of several of these functions. This little ‘bot can follow a bright
light and back up from obstacles that it bumps into.

You have a nearly endless list of possibilities when you start reprogramming
a microcontroller. Writing a new program and downloading it to the micro-
controller takes much less time than rebuilding a circuit, which is precisely
why electronics folks find microcontrollers so darn useful.
Discovering Microcontrollers
for Hobbyists
You can choose from hundreds of microcontrollers, but only a handful give
first-time experimenters what they need. Some manufacturers simply don’t
sell certain brands of microcontrollers to the general public; you can get
other brands from a variety of online and retail stores.
In general, a hobbyist can buy microcontrollers that fall into one of two main
categories: those with an embedded language interpreter and those without.
An embedded language interpreter is a program that runs inside the microcon-
troller. It allows you to write your programs with an easy-to-use language. You
download your program to the microcontroller, and the interpreter converts
it to the type of instructions (called assembly language code) that the micro-
controller understands.

Microcontrollers that have an embedded interpreter are easier to figure out
and use effectively. If you’re just starting out, opt for one of these user-friendly
microcontrollers. Good examples include the BASIC Stamp and OOPic micro-
controllers, both of which we discuss in the section “Microcontrollers That
Stand Out from the Rest” later in this chapter.
The most common language used for embedded interpreters is BASIC. Good
news for computer geeks: if you’ve ever played around with writing computer
programs in BASIC, you’re already well on your way to programming a micro-
controller! Of course, if you’ve never programmed in BASIC, you get to explore
a whole new language. But never fear. BASIC isn’t rocket science. You can
master it soon enough.
If you’re serious about figuring out how to use microcontrollers, check out
Beginning Programming For Dummies, by Wallace Wang (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Some microcontrollers, namely the BASIC Stamp (which we cover in more
detail in the section “Introducing the BASIC Stamp” later in this chapter),
come with fairly thorough printed documentation. Often, you can find every-
thing that you need to complete the project at hand in the user manual that
comes with the microcontroller kit.
You create the program for the microcontroller in a program editor. You also
have to get a special programming hardware module that links your PC and
the microcontroller chip.
You program microcontrollers that don’t contain an embedded interpreter by
using either assembly language or a high-level language.
 Assembly language: The hardest to understand and use, we don’t rec-
ommend assembly language if you’re just starting out. It’s hard to read
assembly language programs and harder to fix them when they don’t
work.
 High-level languages: 98 percent of all computer programs are created
with these languages. They support a rich variety of options and often
make up part of a more elaborate development platform that makes it a
lot easier for you to debug (find and fix problems). For programming
microcontrollers, the three most common high-level languages are
BASIC, C, and Java. Most beginners use BASIC because you can master
it most easily.
How much is that microcontroller
in the window?
Going just by retail prices, microcontrollers vary from about 50¢ to over
$100. Why the huge disparity? There are several reasons:
285
Chapter 13: The Exciting World of Microcontrollers
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 Microcontrollers with an embedded interpreter cost the most. The 
cost of the microcontroller includes the built-in interpreter, as well as an
easy-to-use connection to your PC. (For most microcontrollers without an
embedded interpreter, you have to buy a separate hardware-programming
module that provides the electrical link between the controller and 
your PC.)
 Features, such as the amount of memory or the number of I/O ports,
affect cost. The least expensive microcontrollers have just three or four
I/O ports. The more elaborate microcontrollers have 30 or 40 ports. The
more I/O ports, the more things your microcontroller can control — and
the more money you have to fork over to buy it.
 The ability to re-program the microcontroller over and over again
increases the cost of the chip. You can program the cheapest controllers
once; therefore, people call these controllers OTP, which stands for one-
time programmable. For a few dollars more, you get a microcontroller
with erasable memory: You program it, and then you can erase the exist-
ing program and record another in its place. Most microcontrollers use
a type of memory called Flash, the same kind that your digital camera
or MP3 player uses. You can erase Flash memory and fill it with a new
program a thousand or more times.
PC calling microcontroller:
Come in, please!
If you purchase a microcontroller without an embedded interpreter, you need
to also buy (or make) a hardware-programming module. The hardware module
provides a physical link between your computer and the microcontroller.
You can use most commercial modules to program several microcontrollers
that come from the same manufacturer, so look for that feature. It doesn’t
make sense to get a hardware module that programs just one specific micro-
controller because you lock yourself into just that chip.
The price tag for hardware modules runs from just a few dollars to $100 or
more. You can also build your own module, but most first-timers opt for a
ready-made one to save time and hassle. Take a whack at building your own
module after you’ve gained a little experience with microcontrollers.
Figure 13-3 shows a typical commercial hardware-programming module. This
particular module also provides built-in buttons and lights to help in develop-
ing applications You don’t have to use the added development features just to
program a microcontroller, but they can be nice to have, and don’t usually add
much to the price of the module. You plug the chip into a socket in the module
and attach a cable to your PC. Most, but certainly not all, modules come with
at least one editor that you can use to write your programs. If the module you
buy doesn’t have a programming editor, you need to get one.

Explaining how to select a programming module and programming editor for
a given microcontroller goes way beyond the scope of this book. You can
choose from dozens of options, and the marketplace changes all the time.
Your best bet is to contact the manufacturer of the microcontroller that you
want to use and ask for recommendations.
Microcontrollers That Stand Out
from the Rest
Of the dozens of brands of microcontrollers, two stand out as ideally suited
for hobbyists. The following sections give you a rundown of these microcon-
trollers. Only you can decide which one fits you and your projects.
Introducing the BASIC Stamp
The BASIC Stamp is one of the best-known and most widely used microcon-
trollers for students and hobbyists. That popularity doesn’t come from its
lightning speed or a gaggle of features; it gets its popularity because it was
one of the first microcontrollers to include an embedded interpreter.

287
Chapter 13: The Exciting World of Microcontrollers

The BASIC Stamp derives its name from its built-in BASIC language and its
postage-stamp size (well, a kind of large stamp). You can find out more about
the BASIC Stamp by visiting www.parallax.com.
The BASIC Stamp comes with some of the best documentation that you can
find for a microcontroller. If you’re just starting out, you can’t go wrong with
the BASIC Stamp because of all the tutorials, how-to’s, references, and project
ideas that you can easily find for it.
Tasting different flavors
You probably think a BASIC Stamp is . . . well, basic. But the BASIC Stamp
comes in varieties — 1, 2, SX, and a slew of others. These versions differ in
features and, in some cases, the embedded programming language. Parallax
sells a version of the BASIC Stamp, called the Javelin, which has the Java pro-
gramming language embedded rather than BASIC, for example.
The BASIC Stamp 2, or BS2, is one of the most popular of the gang and the
one that we recommend when you’re just starting out. The BS2 comes on
a single 24-pin chip, as you can see in Figure 13-4. This one chip is actually a
carrier: it contains a lot of little integrated circuits and other components,
such as extra memory and a voltage regulator.

288

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Adding a development board
Although you can use the BS2 chip as-is, most beginners enhance it with a
project board. Parallax sells several boards that you can choose from. One
board, cleverly named the Board of Education (or BOE), has a larger capacity
voltage regulator built in, as well as extra connectors for hooking things up to
it. The BOE, which you can see in Figure 13-5, also includes a little solderless
breadboard right on it so that you can try out different circuits. Very handy!
You can buy the BOE with or without a BS2 chip. You can also find versions
that you connect to your PC using a serial or USB cable. If your computer
lacks a serial port — if you have a late-model laptop, for example — you have
to get the USB version.
Don’t forget the programming software
You have to get specialized software for programming any version of the
BASIC Stamp. You can get the software for free. It comes included as part of
a BASIC Stamp starter kit. You can also download it from the Parallax Web
site. You can find several versions of the software for use with MS-DOS,
Windows 98 or later, Macintosh, or Linux.
You can run the MS-DOS editor under Windows 95 or 98. This great option lets
you dedicate an old, otherwise useless PC just to programming the BASIC
Stamp.

If you happen to already have a BASIC Stamp and programming editor, check
the version of the software. If it’s kind of dated, be sure to update the software
with the latest and greatest available at the Parallax site. Newer versions of
the BASIC Stamp software include some handy additional features that you
will definitely want!
Introducing the OOPic
The OOPic — pronounced ew-pik — is a relative newcomer to the exciting
world of hobby microcontrollers. Even so, it’s catching on fast. The OOPic
uses a radically different method of programming, involving objects.
The idea behind this type of programming is that you use these objects, instead
of writing lots and lots of code to program common tasks. Because most experi-
menters use microcontrollers for the same purposes, such as operating motors
or reading switch settings, the OOPic makes your job easier by letting objects

Kicking it up a notch with PICMicro and Atmel AVR
No discussion of microcontrollers would be
complete without mentioning the PICMicro
series, from Microchip, and the AVR series,
from Atmel. The PICMicro and AVR families lack
an embedded language interpreter. Instead, you
program them using a special hardware module
(see the section “PC calling microprocessor:
Come in, please” in this chapter) and a custom
programming editor.
This programming approach has one advan-
tage: you can choose from among a number of
different programming languages and develop-
ment platforms. This is useful if you’re already
familiar or comfortable with a particular pro-
gramming language. You don’t have to learn yet
another language if you pick up an interest in
microcontrollers. But this route is a lot more
complicated. We don’t recommend it if you’re
just starting out with microcontrollers or have
never done much programming. And, depend-
ing on the microcontroller chip, you may need
to use extra circuitry to make it work. This extra
circuitry includes a crystal oscillator, some
capacitors to make the oscillator function, and
a voltage regulator.
If you want to try your hand at the PICMicro or
AVR microcontrollers, check around for a
starter kit that includes everything that you
need: a sample microcontroller chip, a pro-
gramming module, software, and cables to
connect to your PC. Many online retailers, such
as Digikey or Jameco, sell these starter kits for
PICMicro or AVR microcontrollers. The starter
kit makes figuring out how to use these beasties
a lot easier.
You can read more about the PIC Micro and AVR
controllers at the Web addresses provided here.
While neither company sells to consumers
directly, the sites provide lists of online distribu-
tors you can contact. The Web sites contain
product information, datasheets, and detailed
training materials on using the products.

do much of the work for you. Using objects, you avoid the traditional method of
programming microcontrollers where you have to write several lines of code
for each of these tasks. The result: you really save a lot of time.
With the OOPic, they built the functionality for working with real-world devices
into the chip. You just tell the OOPic what you connected it to and then give it
simple commands. The OOPic figures out how to control the specified device
all on its own.
This approach to programming isn’t new or novel to computer programmers,
but it is unique to microcontrollers. It may take you a little while to get used
to the programming style of the OOPic, but after you get the hang of it, you
find that it simplifies a lot of mundane tasks. Read more about the OOPic on
the Web site at www.oopic.com.
Going all-in-one or single chip
Like the BASIC Stamp, you can find the OOPic in a couple of different ver-
sions. You can buy the OOPic already connected to a carrier board (see
Figure 13-6) or as a 24-pin chip, just like the BASIC Stamp 2. Our favorite ver-
sion of the OOPic is the OOPic R, the one that you can see in Figure 13-6. The
carrier board comes equipped with a speaker, several switches, some LEDs
that act as indicator lights, and a whole mess of connector pins that you use
to attach components.

You can set the OOPic’s programming software to use any of three popular
languages: BASIC (recommended for beginners), C, or Java. You can get the
programming software as a free download from www.oopic.com. The OOPic
Webmaster updates the site from time to time with new features.
Getting to Know the BASIC Stamp 2
Now it’s time to take a closer look at how you can use one microcontroller —
specifically, the BASIC Stamp 2 — to create some simple electronics projects.
Mind you, the power of microcontrollers goes way beyond the basic exam-
ples that we provide in the following sections. But the beginner’s projects
should give you an idea of the power that lurks under the hood of one of
these babies. When you’re done with these, check out Chapter 15, where
you explore how to use the BASIC Stamp 2 to build a small, intelligent robot.
Step 1: Making the circuit
Although the BASIC Stamp is self-contained and doesn’t need anything else to
perform its function, you still need to connect things to it. What you connect
to the BASIC Stamp depends on what kind of circuit you want to build.
Suppose, for example, that you want the program in the BASIC Stamp to flash
an LED. This circuit always works well as a demonstration because you only
need two components — a resistor and an LED — and you can easily tell if
the connection works or not.
Take a look at the diagram in Figure 13-7. To build this circuit, you connect a
resistor and LED to the BASIC Stamp as Figure 13-7 shows you. You can plug
things into the BASIC Stamp a whole lot more easily if you have an experi-
menter’s board, such as the Board of Education (BOE). The BOE also provides
a convenient way to connect the BASIC Stamp to your PC by using a serial or
USB cable, and to plug in power. If you use the BOE, you’ll find that I/O Pin 0
is labeled as P0 in the column of labels next to the solderless breadboard.
Figure 13-8 shows you the blinking LED circuit on a BOE.
Step 2: Programming the darned thing
With the circuit all hooked up, you’re ready to program the BASIC Stamp to
flash the LED. We assume that you already have the BASIC Stamp program-
ming software installed on your computer, all set up and ready to go. (If you
don’t, you have to do that part now. We can wait . . .)

short program. When you’re done, the editor window should look like the
one in Figure 13-9.

loop:
HIGH 0      ‘ pin 0 high (the LED turns on)
PAUSE 250   ‘ wait 250 milliseconds
LOW 0       ‘ pin 0 low (the LED turns off)
PAUSE 250   ‘ wait 250 milliseconds
GOTO loop   ‘ loop forever
Here’s how the LED flasher program works, line by line:
 Line 1: Tells the editor what kind of BASIC Stamp you’re using. This
example uses BASIC Stamp 2, so the line reads ($STAMP BS2).
 Line 2: This is what you call a label. You use it here and later in the pro-
gram, on the last line, to create a never-ending loop.
 Line 3: HIGH 0 turns I/O pin 0 on (makes it high). Because the LED con-
nects to I/O pin 0, this line turns the LED on.
 Line 4: PAUSE 250 makes the BASIC Stamp pause for 250 milliseconds.
Remember that a millisecond is one thousandth of a second, so 250 mil-
liseconds is 250/1000, or a quarter of a second.
 Line 5: LOW 0 turns I/O pin 0 off (makes it low). This turns the LED off.
 Line 6: PAUSE 250 makes the BASIC Stamp pause again for another 250
milliseconds.
 Line 7: GOTO loop tells the BASIC Stamp to go to the label named loop.
This command causes the program to repeat over and over again, until
either you turn the BASIC Stamp off or you reprogram it to do something
different.
294
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
Commanding all BASIC Stamps
Take a look at the LED demonstrator program in
the section “Step 2: Programming the darn thing.”
The program uses words such as PAUSE, HIGH,
and LOW. These words are commands, also called
programming statements, which tell the BASIC
Stamp what to do. The BASIC Stamp provides
several dozen of these programming statements.
The way that you use these statements in your
code determines what your program does. To use
the BASIC Stamp, or any microcontroller, you
have to master these programming statements.
One of the best ways to get comfortable
using programming statements is to try out
demonstrator programs, such as the one in the
section “Getting to Know the BASIC Stamp 2.”
Look for short examples in the BASIC Stamp doc-
umentation and check out books, magazines, and
Web sites that provide information on the BASIC
Stamp. The more hands-on experience you have,
the faster you discover how things work.
After you build an example circuit for the BASIC
Stamp, don’t be afraid to experiment by chang-
ing some of the programming or connecting
different components. You can build very elabo-
rate programs this way, one little piece at a time.

The BASIC Stamp software editor treats any text after an apostrophe as a
comment. You make comments just for yourself; the BASIC Stamp ignores
them and doesn’t process them as instructions. Line 1 of the LED program
falls into the comment category. You may want to get into the habit of adding
at least a few comments to your programs to remind you of why you wrote
what you wrote. Then, down the road, if you revisit a program, the comments
give you a handy reminder of your intentions.
Step 3: Let ‘er rip!
Okay, budding programmers: you’re now ready to upload and try out the
program:
1. Connect a serial or USB cable to the Board of Education and your PC.
The type of cable depends on the version of the BOE that you have.
2. Apply power to the BOE by plugging the wall transformer into the
BOE power jack.
Alternatively, you can attach a 9-volt battery to the battery terminals in
the upper-left corner of the BOE.

3. In the BASIC Stamp editor, press Ctrl+R (the Ctrl key and the R key at
the same time).
This keystroke combo runs your program and downloads it to the BASIC
Stamp.
If you have everything set up right, the LED should begin to flash twice each
second. If the BASIC Stamp editor displays an error on your computer screen,
locate and fix the problem (maybe a typo in your code?) and try again.
Making changes made easy
Here’s where the power of microcontrollers really shines! Make the following
changes in the program that we describe in the section “Step 2: Programming
the darned thing” earlier in this chapter:
 Change Line 4 to PAUSE 100
 Also change Line 6 to PAUSE 100
Now, run the program (press Ctrl+R). What happens when you run the pro-
gram this time? Your computer downloads the changes into the BASIC Stamp,
and the LED now flashes much more quickly. Instead of pausing 250 millisec-
onds each time that the LED turns on and off, the BASIC Stamp pauses for
only 100 milliseconds.
Change the program again with these adjustments:
 Change Line 4 to PAUSE 1000
 Also change Line 6 to PAUSE 1000
You can probably guess what happens. The LED flashes relatively slowly . . .
once every other second. The BASIC Stamp now pauses 1000 milliseconds, or
one full second, each time the LED turns on or off.
As you can see, by simply changing a line or two of programming code, you
alter the behavior of your circuit.
Adding a switch to the mix
In this section, you can experience the versatility of the BASIC Stamp. You use
the LED for the next demonstration, so make sure that you leave it hooked
up, as we describe in the section “Getting to Know the BASIC Stamp 2” earlier
in this chapter. Connect a switch to the Board of Education, following the
schematic in Figure 13-10. You can use any ordinary switch, but a momentary
296
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

pushbutton does the job the best. Be sure to add the 10K ohm resistor as
Figure 13-10 shows you. If you use the BOE, you see that I/O pin 1 is labeled
as P1 in the column of labels next to the solderless breadboard.
What purpose does the 10K ohm resistor serve? It functions as a pulldown,
which means that when the switch is not closed, the signal input feeding into
the BASIC Stamp is 0 volts, or low. The resistor keeps the input to the BASIC
Stamp from varying (called floating), which can cause the BASIC Stamp to
give you erratic results.
Now, enter the test program:
‘{$STAMP BS2}
OUTPUT 0
‘ set pin 0 as output (for LED)
btn   VAR   Byte
‘ define “btn” as a variable
loop:
BUTTON 1,0,255,250,btn,0,noSwitch
‘ check
switch
OUT0 = btn
‘ turn LED on if switch was triggered
PAUSE 150
‘ wait 150 milliseconds
OUT0 = 0
‘ turn LED off
noSwitch: GOTO loop
‘ repeat loop
Here’s how this program works:
 Line 1: Tells the editor what kind of BASIC Stamp you’re using — in this
case, the BASIC Stamp 2. (The computer doesn’t take any action regard-
ing this comment line because of the apostrophe that begins it.)
 Line 2: OUTPUT 0 tells the BASIC Stamp to use I/O pin 0 as an output.
You should have the LED connected to I/O pin 0 (if you don’t, be sure to
go through the steps in the section “Getting to Know the BASIC Stamp 2”
earlier in this chapter).

 Line 3: This line, which reads btn VAR Byte, tells the BASIC Stamp to
set aside a little bit of memory for a variable named btn. A variable is a
temporary holding area for data. After the variable has been created, the
BASIC Stamp can stuff data into it and then later come back and check to
see what’s in it.
 Line 4: The line loop: sets up a repeating loop, exactly as in the LED
example in the section “Step 2: Programming the darned thing” earlier
in this chapter.
 Line 5: This line starts with the BUTTON programming statement and
tells the BASIC Stamp to check the state of the switch connected to I/O
pin 1. The BUTTON statement requires a bunch of additional options,
which you can find in the BASIC Stamp documentation that came with
your BASIC Stamp kit.
 Lines 6 through 8: These lines turn the LED on, tell the BASIC Stamp to
wait 150 milliseconds, and then extinguish the LED again.
 Line 9: Tells the BASIC Stamp to repeat itself, starting from the loop:
label. This repeat goes on forever or until you unplug the BASIC Stamp
or upload a new program.
See the noSwitch label in lines 5 and 9? When used with the BUTTON state-
ment (as in Line 5), this label creates what is known as a branch. Should the
switch not be depressed (the noSwitch part of the code), the BASIC Stamp
jumps from the BUTTON statement line and goes all the way down to the last
line, missing all the instructions for lighting the LED. But if the switch is
depressed, the BASIC Stamp performs all the steps.
Here’s what should happen when you run the program:
 When the switch isn’t depressed, the LED stays off.
 When the switch is depressed, the LED blinks on briefly, and then turns
off again.
Uh oh! If your BASIC Stamp doesn’t respond this way, double-check how you
have everything wired together, and verify that you typed the program in
exactly as you see it in this section.
Where to Go from Here
This chapter touches on just the basics of the BASIC Stamp. You can find a
whole lot more to do with the BASIC Stamp, or any other microcontroller that
you want to try, for that matter. Check your neighborhood bookstore for ref-
erences on using microcontrollers. Try Google or another online search
engine to browse for goodies about your microcontroller of choice.

etting up to speed on electronics really pays off when you get to the
point where you can actually build a project or two. In this chapter, you
get to play with several fun, entertaining, and educational electronics gadgets
that you can build in half an hour or less. We selected the projects for their
high cool factor and their simplicity. We’ve kept parts to a minimum, and the
most expensive project costs under $15 or so to build.
We’ve given you some detailed procedures for the first project, so work
through that first. Then, you should be able to follow the circuit schematics
and build the rest of the projects on your own. Check back to Chapters 6 
and 7 if you need a little help reading or understanding the schematics.

Getting What You Need 
Right Off the Bat
You can build all the projects in this chapter, except for the electronic compass,
on a solderless breadboard. Of course, feel free to build any of the projects on a
regular soldered circuit board, if you want to keep them around.
We cover all the parts you use in these projects, such as transistors, inte-
grated circuits, capacitors, and even wire in Chapters 4 and 5. There’s more
detail about breadboarding and building circuits in Chapters 11 and 12. If you
get stuck on any of these projects, hop to one of those chapters to help you
through.
With one exception (that pesky but worthwhile electronic compass project,
again), you can find the parts that you need to construct the projects in this
chapter at any electronics store or online retailer. If you don’t have a well-
stocked electronics outlet near you, check out both Chapter 17 and the
Appendix for some mail-order electronics parts suppliers.
Unless we tell you otherwise:
 All resistors are rated for 1⁄4 or 1⁄8 watt and 5 percent or 10 percent 
tolerance.
 All capacitors are rated at a minimum of 25 volts. We note the type of
capacitor that you need (disc, electrolytic, or tantalum) in the parts list
for each project.
Creating Cool, Crazy, Blinky Lights
The first project that one of us ever built was a light that blinked on and off.
That’s all it did, but that was enough. The project involved soldering together
all the transistors, resistors, and diodes. Start to finish, the whole project
took two days and cost a pricey $17 in parts. Today, thanks to one specific
integrated circuit, making your first blinky light project doesn’t take you
more than a few minutes and costs less than two bucks. The special ingredi-
ent that makes the blinky light circuit easy to build is the LM555 timer IC.
This particular chip is to electronics what milk is to cookies. It’s the corner-
stone of many projects that you build, including several in this chapter. You
can use the 555 in a variety of ways, but the most important use is to provide
300
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

pulses at regular intervals, sort of like an electronic metronome. Throughout
this chapter you see several ways to use this feature to produce a number of
cool effects.
You can buy the LM555 at most any electronics store. We like to buy them in
packs of 15 or 20, to save money. Don’t worry about overstocking; you use
them up soon enough. The price for one may be anywhere from 75¢ to $1.50,
but when you purchase in quantity, the price goes down to less than half that
per circuit. Online retail stores that sell the 555 by the tube tend to offer the
best price. The tube is 18 to 24 inches long (depending on the source) and
contains as many as a couple dozen chips.
Taking a closer look at the 555 flasher
You can see the schematic of the blinky light project in Figure 14-1. This figure
shows you how to connect a 555 timer IC to an LED. By turning variable resis-
tor (potentiometer) R1, you change the rate of blinks from a slow waltz to a
fast samba.
If you need a quick refresher course on reading schematics, head back to
Chapter 6.
This circuit provides a useful demonstration of how you can use the 555 as
an astable multivibrator. That’s just a fancy term for a timer that goes off (not
turns off, but goes off like an alarm clock) over and over again, forever (or
until it runs out of juice to power it).
This circuit also makes a handy piece of test equipment. Connect the output
of the 555 (pin 3 on the chip) to some other project and use this circuit as a
signal source. You see how this works in several of the other projects in this
chapter that are built around the 555 chip.
It’s easy to build the LED flasher circuit. Use the schematic you see in Figure
14-2 as your guide. Note that we added a bit more space between components
so that it’s easier for you to see where all the parts go. You should usually
build in a little bit of space, rather than squeezing things together, so you can
see what you’re doing.
Follow these steps to build the circuit:
1. Collect all the components you need for the project ahead of time. See
the parts list below for a rundown of what you need.
There’s nothing worse than starting a project, only to have to stop
halfway through because you don’t have everything at hand! 
301
Chapter 14: Great Projects You Can Build in 30 Minutes or Less

2. Carefully insert the 555 timer chip into the middle of the board. 
The IC should straddle the empty middle row of the breadboard. The
clocking notch of the chip (that little indentation or dimple on one end)
should face the left of the board. Though this isn’t mandatory, it’s con-
sidered common practice among electronics folk.
3. Insert the two fixed resistors, R2 and R3, into the board, following the
schematic and the sample breadboard in Figure 14-2. 
As noted in Chapter 4, the pins on integrated circuit chips are numbered
counter-clockwise, starting at the clocking notch. So, if you’re facing the
breadboard with the 555 on it, and the clocking notch is on your left, Pin
1 is to the left of the clocking notch and Pins 2, 3, and 4 run in a column
down the left side of the IC. On the right side of the IC, Pin 5 is opposite
Pin 4, and Pins 6, 7, and 8 run up in a column (with Pin 8 opposite Pin 1).
4. Insert the two capacitors, C1 and C2, into the board, following the
schematic and the sample breadboard in Figure 14-2.
5. Solder wires to the potentiometer (R1) to connect it to the 
breadboard. 
Use 22 gauge solid strand hookup wire. The color doesn’t matter. Note
that the potentiometer has three connections to it. One connection goes
to pin 7 of the 555; the other two connections are joined (or “bridged”)
and attach to the V+ of the power supply.

6. Connect the light-emitting diode as shown in the schematic and the
sample breadboard. 
You must observe proper orientation when inserting this component.
You must connect the cathode of the LED to ground. Check the packag-
ing that came with your LED to make sure you get it right. (If you don’t,
and you insert the LED backwards, nothing bad will happen, but the LED
won’t light. Simply remove the LED, and reinsert it, the other way
around.)
7. Use 22 gauge single strand wire, preferably already pre-cut and
trimmed for use with a solderless breadboard, to finish making the
connections. 
Folks commonly refer to these wires as jumpers; most of the circuits 
you build will have at least one or two. Use the sample breadboard in
Figure 14-2 as a guide to making these connections.
8. Before applying power, double-check your work. Verify all the proper
connections by cross-checking your wiring against the schematic.
9. Finally, attach a 9-volt battery to the V+ and ground rows of the 
breadboard. 
The V+ row is on the top, and the ground row is on the bottom. It’s easier
to use a 9 volt battery clip, which you can get at RadioShack and other
electronics stores. It’s a good idea to solder 22-guage solid hookup wire
to the ends of the leads from the clip; this makes it easier to insert the
wires into the solderless breadboard. Remember: the red lead from the
battery clip is V+; the black lead is ground.
When you apply power to the circuit, the LED should flash. Rotate the R1 knob
to change the speed of the flashing. If your circuit doesn’t work, disconnect
the 9-volt battery, and check the connections again. 
Here are some common mistakes you should look for:
 You inserted the 555 IC backwards. This can damage the chip, so if this
happens, you might want to try another 555.
 You inserted the LED backwards. Pull it out and reverse the leads.
 You didn’t press the connection wires and component leads into the
breadboard sockets firmly enough. Be sure that each wire fits snugly
into the breadboard, so there are no loose connections.
 The component values are wrong. Double-check, just in case!
 The battery died. Try a new one.
 You wired the circuit wrong. Have a friend take a look. Fresh eyes can
catch mistakes that you might not notice.

Its good electronics practice to build a circuit that’s new to you on a bread-
board first, as you often need to tweak a circuit to get it working just the way
you want it to. Once you have it working to your satisfaction on a breadboard,
then you can make the circuit permanent if you like. Just take your time, and
remember to double- and even triple-check your work. Don’t worry — you’ll
be a pro in no time, and building fairly complex circuits on your solderless
breadboard.

Putting the Squeeze on 
with Piezoelectricity
Not all electronic circuits require batteries, resistors, capacitors, transistors,
or any of the other usual components that you find in an electronic circuit.
This project generates its own electricity and you end up with a light drum
consisting of a neon light that glows when you tap on a piezo disc. It serves
as a great demonstration of something called piezoelectrics.
Piezo — what?
The term piezo comes from a Greek word meaning to press or squeeze. Many
years ago, folks with too much time on their hands found that you can gener-
ate electricity when you press certain kinds of crystals really hard. Lo and
behold, these same crystals change shape — though only slightly — when
you apply electricity to them. It turns out that this find was an important dis-
covery because we use piezoelectricity in tons of everyday gadgets, such as
quartz watches, alarm buzzers, barbecue grill starters, and scads of other
devices.
Experimenting with piezoelectricity
A simple and fun way to experiment with piezoelectricity is to get a bare
piezo disc. You can find these discs at most electronics stores and also
online. You can get them very cheaply; usually a dollar or less apiece.
Get a disc with the two wires already soldered onto it. Some discs only have
one wire; these discs work just fine, too. You can clip a wire to the edge of 
the disc’s metal for the ground connection.
Figure 14-3 shows a demonstrator circuit with one disc and one neon bulb. (Try
RadioShack or other electronics stores to get the neon bulb.) Neon bulbs are
special in that they don’t light up unless you feed them at least 90 volts. That’s
a lot of juice! But the piezo disc easily generates this much voltage.
305
Chapter 14: Great Projects You Can Build in 30 Minutes or Less
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

To build the circuit in Figure 14-3, follow these steps:
1. Place the disc on an insulated surface.
A wooden or plastic table surface works fine, but don’t use a surface
made of metal.
2. Connect the disc and neon bulb together by using two alligator test
leads, as shown in Figure 14-4. 
Place one test lead from the red wire of the disc to one connection of the
neon lamp (it doesn’t matter which connection). The other test lead
goes from the black wire of the disc to the other connection of the neon
lamp.
3. Place the disc flat on the table.
4. With the plastic end of a screwdriver, rap very hard on the disc.
Each time you rap the disc, the neon bulb flickers.
Avoid touching the two wires that come from the disc. Although the shock
you get isn’t dangerous, it definitely won’t feel very good!
Need some ideas for how to use this concoction to impress your family and
friends? How about building a light drum?
Follow these steps to build your very own light drum and dazzle your loved
ones:
1. String up a whole slew of discs and bulbs in a row.
2. Tape or glue these disc-bulb combos to a plastic base.
3. Get a pair of drumsticks, turn down the lights, and tap on the discs in
time with your favorite mood music.

For the circuit that demonstrates piezoelectricity, you need these very few
parts:

 Two alligator clips
 Something to whack the disc with, such as a screwdriver or drumsticks

Building the Amazing See-in-the-Dark
Infrared Detector
Did you ever want to see in the dark like a cat? Now you can, by building this
simple infrared detector. The circuit uses just three parts (plus a battery).
You can make the circuit a little fancier by adding an SPST (single-pole single-
throw) toggle switch between the + (positive) side of the battery and the pho-
totransistor to turn the detector on and off; or you can go the simple route
and just unplug the battery when you aren’t using the detector.
Figure 14-5 shows the schematic for the infrared detector. Be sure to use a
phototransistor, and not a photodiode, in this circuit. They look the same on
the outside, so check the packaging. Also, be sure to get the proper orienta-
tion for both the phototransistor and the LED. If you hook up either one back-
ward, the circuit fails.
Chasing down infrared light
Using the infrared detector, you can test for infrared light from a number of
sources. Here are just two ideas to try:
 Getting to the bottom of a remote control dilemma: Because remote
controls use invisible infrared light, you have a hard time figuring out
what’s wrong when they stop working. Does the remote have a problem,

or should you blame your TV or other appliance? To test the remote
control, place it up against the infrared phototransistor. Press any
button on the remote; if the LED on your project flashes, you know that
you have a working remote.
 Counter-surveillance: Check to see if somebody’s hidden camera is in
your room. These days, covert cameras (such as the one in Figure 14-6)
can see in the dark by using a built-in bright infrared light source. You can
use the infrared detector circuit to find these sources, even if you can’t
see them yourself. Turn off the lights and scan the room by holding the
detector in your hand and moving it around the room. If the LED bright-
ens, even though you don’t see a light source, you may have just found
the infrared light coming from a hidden camera!
Although the infrared phototransistor is most sensitive to infrared light, it
also responds to visible light. For best results, use the infrared detector in a
dimly lit room. Sunlight, and direct light from desk lamps and other sources,
can influence the readings.

Detecting parts for the infrared detector
Short and sweet, here’s the list of what you need to build this project:
 Q1: Infrared phototransistor (our sample circuit uses a RadioShack
276-0145, but almost any phototransistor should work fine)
 R1: 330-ohm resistor
 LED: Light-emitting diode (any color)
Cheese It! It’s the Cops!!
Unfortunately, you can’t arrest any bad guys when you set off the warbling
siren that you build in this project. But it sounds cool, and you can use it as
an alarm to notify you if somebody’s getting at your secret stash: Baseball
cards, vintage Frank Sinatra records, your signed copy of Mister Spock’s Music
from Outer Space record, or whatever.
How your warbler works
This circuit (see Figure 14-7) uses two 555 timer chips. You rig both chips to
act as astable multivibrators; that is, they constantly change their output
from low to high to low to high . . . over and over again. The two timers run 
at different frequencies. The timer chip on the right in the figure produces 
an audible tone. If you connect a speaker directly to the output of this timer,
you hear a steady, medium-pitch sound.
The output of the 555 chip on the left, which produces a slower rising and
falling tone, connects into pin 5 of the 555 chip on the right in the figure. You
connect the speaker to the output of the 555 chip on the right.
Adjust the two potentiometers, R2 and R4, to change the pitch and speed of
the siren. You can produce all sorts of siren and other weird sound effects by
adjusting these two potentiometers. You can operate this circuit at any volt-
age between 5 and about 15 volts.

Get Lost . . . or Found, with 
the Electronic Compass
Discover where in the world you are with this very cool electronic compass!
This magnetic compass uses the same technology that manufacturers build
into many cars to show you your direction electronically. Four LEDs light up
to show you the four cardinal points on the map: N (north), S (south), E (east),
and W (west). The circuit illuminates adjacent LEDs to show the in-between
directions, SW, SE, NW, and NE.
Peeking under the compass hood
At the heart of this project is a special compass module, the Dinsmore 1490.
This module isn’t a common, everyday part. You have to special order it, but
you can have a lot of fun with the project, making it worth the $13 to $15 that
you pay for the compass module. Check out the manufacturer’s representa-
tive at www.robsonco.com for the compass module, and don’t forget to try
other possible sources by doing a Google or Yahoo! search. Try the search
phrase “dinsmore compass.”
The 1490 compass module is about the size of a small thimble. The bottom of
the sensor has a series of 12 tiny pins, as you can see in the pinout drawing in
Figure 14-8. The pins are arranged in groups of four and consist of the follow-
ing connection types:
 Power
 Ground
 Output (or signal)
You can see the schematic for the electronic compass in Figure 14-9. By doing
some careful soldering, you can build a nice portable, electronic compass that
you can take anywhere. Put it in a small enclosure, with the LEDs arranged in
typical clockwise N, E, S, W circular orientation. You can buy enclosures at
RadioShack and other electronics stores. They come in a variety of sizes, start-
ing from about two inches square. Select an enclosure large enough to contain
the circuit board and batteries.
You can power the compass by using a 9-volt battery. Add a switch from the 
+ (positive) terminal of the battery to turn the unit on or off, or simply
remove the battery from its clip to cut the juice and turn off your compass.

Checking your electronic compass parts
To point you in the right direction, here are the parts that you need to gather
to build your compass:
 COMPASS: Dinsmore 1490 magnetic electronic compass (see the section
“Peeking under the compass hood” earlier in this chapter)
 R1-R4: 1 Kohm
 C1: 10-µF electrolytic (polarized) capacitor
 LED1-LED4: Light-emitting diode (any color)
 MISC: Project box, switch, battery clip (all optional)
When There’s Light, You 
Hear This Noise . . .
Figure 14-10 shows you a schematic of a light alarm. The idea of this project
is simple: if a light comes on, the alarm goes off. You build the alarm around
an LM555 timer chip, which acts as a tone generator. When light hits the pho-
toresistor, the change in resistance triggers transistor Q1. This response
turns the 555 on, and it squeals its little heart out. You can adjust the sensi-
tivity of the alarm by turning R1, which is a variable resistor (potentiometer).
Making your alarm work for you
Does it seem a little nuts to create an alarm that goes off whenever it senses
light? Surprise! You can apply this handy light alarm in several practical
ways. Here are just a few of ‘em:
 Put the light alarm inside a pantry so that it goes off whenever someone
raids the Oreo cookies. Keep your significant other out of your stash —
or keep yourself on that diet! When the pantry door opens, light comes
in and the alarm goes off.
 Do you have a complex electronics project in progress in the garage that
you don’t want anybody to disturb? Place the alarm inside the garage,
near the door. If someone opens the garage door during the day, light
comes through and the alarm sounds.
 Build your own electronic rooster that wakes you up at daybreak. (Who
needs an alarm clock?)

‘Lil Amp, Big Sound
Give your electronics projects a big mouth with this little amplifier designed
around parts that are inexpensive and easy-to-find at most electronics sup-
pliers. LM386 power amplifier IC — this amp boosts the volume from micro-
phones, tone generators, and many other signal sources.
The ins and outs of ‘Lil Amp
Figure 14-11 shows the schematic for this project, which consists of just six
parts, including the speaker. You can operate the amplifier at voltages
between 5 and about 15 volts. A 9-volt battery does the trick.
To use the amplifier, connect a signal source, such as a microphone, to pin 3
of the LM386. Be sure to also connect the ground of the signal source to the
common ground of the amplifier circuit.
Depending on the source signal, you may find that you get better sound if you
place a 0.1-µF to 10-µF capacitor between the source and pin 3 of the LM386.
For smaller values (less than about 0.47-µF), use a disc capacitor; for larger
values (1-µF or higher), use a tantalum capacitor. When you use a polarized
capacitor, orient the + (positive) side of the component toward the signal
source.

Building the Handy-Dandy Water Tester
You may not be able to divine underground water with the water tester cir-
cuit in Figure 14-12, but it can help you check for moisture in plants or find
water trapped under wall-to-wall carpet.
How the water tester works
The Handy-Dandy Water Tester is deceptively simple. It works under the prin-
ciple of electrical conductivity of water (this is the principle that says you
don’t take a bath with a plugged-in toaster in your lap). The tester contains
two small metal probes. When you place the probes in water, the conductiv-
ity of the water completes a circuit. This completed circuit drives current to
a transistor. When the transistor turns on, it lights an LED. When the probes
aren’t in contact with water (or some other conductive body), your tester
has a broken circuit, and the LED doesn’t light up.
317
Chapter 14: Great Projects You Can Build in 30 Minutes or Less
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You make the two probes with small nails, say 4d (four penny). Place the nails
about a half-inch apart on a piece of plastic (but not wood or metal). The nails
should be parallel to one another. File down the tips of the nails to make sharp
points. These points help you drive the probes deep into the material that
you’re testing. For example, you can drive the probes into a carpet and pad to
determine if water has seeped under the carpeting after a pipe in the next room
bursts.
You can adjust the sensitivity of the tester by turning potentiometer R2. Start
with the potentiometer in its middle position and turn one way or another,
depending on the amount of moisture or water in the object that you’re testing.
Power the water tester by using 5 to 12 volts. A 9-volt battery works well.

Creating a Very Cool Lighting 
Effects Generator
If you were a fan of the Knight Rider television series that aired back in the
’80s, you remember the sequential light chaser that the Kitt Car sported. You
can easily build your own (light chaser setup, not car) in the garage in under
an hour. 
To build your own mesmerizing lighting effects generator (see the schematic
for it in Figure 14-13), you need just two low-priced integrated circuits and a
handful of inexpensive parts.
The circuit has two sections:
 The brains: An LM555 timer IC makes up the first section, on the left of
the schematic. You wire this chip to function as an astable multivibrator
(in fact, you make the same basic circuit as the LED flasher that we
describe in the section “Creating Cool, Crazy, Blinky Lights” earlier in
this chapter). The 555 produces a series of pulses; you determine the
speed of the pulses by dialing potentiometer R1.
 The body: The second section, on the left of the schematic, contains a
4017 CMOS Decade Counter chip. The 4017 chip switches each of 10
LEDs on, in succession. The LEDs are switched when the 4017 receives 
a pulse from the 555. You wire the 4017 so that it repeats the 1-to-10
sequence over and over again, for as long as the circuit has power.
Arranging the LEDs
You can build the lighting effects generator on a solderless breadboard just
to try it out. If you plan to make it into a permanent circuit, give some thought
to the arrangement of the ten LEDs. For example, to achieve different lighting
effects, you can try the following:
 Put all the LEDs in a row, in sequence: The lights chase each other up
(or down) over and over again.
 Put all the LEDs in a row, but alternate the sequence left and right:
Wire the LEDs so that the sequence starts from the outside and works
its way inside.

 Place the LEDs in a circle so that the LEDs sequence clockwise or
counterclockwise: This light pattern looks like a roulette wheel.
 Arrange the LEDs in a heart shape: You can use this arrangement to
make a unique Valentine’s Day present.

ake no mistake: Electronics is fun. But after you’ve built your 14th
blinky light project, you yearn for more of a challenge. You look for
bigger and better projects as you explore new facets of the electronic arts.
Robotics may be just what you’re looking for. A robot is an amalgam of hard-
ware, software, and electronics — all twisted together in a way that appears
to bring life to a lump of plastic, metal, and silicon. Not long ago, building a
robot meant toiling long hours in the garage and spending hundreds, if not
thousands, of dollars. 
Thanks to modern electronics, especially the microcontroller that lets you
program a robot to perform all sorts of actions, you can build a robot for
under $150. You get to decide what your robot does. You can have it seek out
new life forms or explore the dark regions of your nephew’s room. Or maybe
you have a use in mind that no one has even thought of yet.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

In this chapter, you build two robots. (Actually, you build one robot, but in
two versions.) The first version is a simple ‘bot with no brain. In the second
version, you add a microcontroller, which you program to make your robot
perform various tasks. With or without a brain, both ‘bots give you the
opportunity for a lot of fun.
Robots: The Big Picture
You’re probably familiar with robots in the movies. These things walk, talk,
and fend off alien armadas with their laser beam weapons. While there have
been great strides in technology over the past several decades, today’s
robots aren’t quite this fantastic. A robot that you build in your garage is
more likely to be about the size of a cat, with less thinking capacity than a
cockroach. This doesn’t mean they aren’t fun, though! On the contrary, play-
ing around with small robots is a rewarding hobby, and they’re getting cooler
all the time.
The two projects we included in this chapter represent two distinct families
of robots: human-controlled and autonomous:
 You manipulate a human-controlled robot. It’s the person, not the
robot, who does all the thinking. These work a lot like a remotely con-
trolled racecar. The control may be wired or wireless. If you build one 
of these robots, it’s an ideal way to get your feet wet because you can
start out with a simple project and work your way up to more complex
designs. 
 Autonomous robots think all on their own. They have a small com-
puter for a brain, and usually, one or more sensors so that they can
detect their environment and respond to it. You program the robot’s
computer, and that controls all of the little critter’s actions. 
In this chapter you start out by constructing a human-controlled robot. The
design is simple, consisting of a robot base that has two motors, two drive
wheels, and a swivel caster that keeps it balanced. You control the robot by
flipping two switches. Each switch controls one of the motors. You mount the
switches on a little piece of wood or plastic, along with a few AA batteries.
You connect the batteries and switches to the robot motors with long wires,
so you can walk around the room while steering your robot.
Then, you will read all about how to build an autonomous robot. In this ver-
sion, you do away with the switches and replace them with a BASIC Stamp 2
microcontroller to program the ‘bot. The robot also uses a switch as a kind of
bumper that tells the robot when it’s run smack into something. You also dis-
cover how to program the microcontroller to make the robot steer in a new
direction when the switch is bumped.

Rover the Robot parts list
Here are the parts that you need to build your robot (we tell you more about
all of these shortly):
 Bottom deck, cut to size
 Top deck, cut to size
 2 Tamiya worm gear motors (model #72004)
 2 Tamiya Narrow Wheel sets (model #70145)
 11⁄4-inch swivel caster

 2 6-32 nuts (for caster)
 4 risers, constructed with standoffs or 6-32 machine screws
 2 DPDT center-off toggle switches (Get toggle variety switches, with a
center-off position. The switches should be spring-loaded momentary.
That way, the switch handle will return to the center-off position when
you release it.)
 4-cell AA battery holder
 Small wooden or plastic board (about 4”x4” is fine) for mounting the
switches and battery.
 20 to 25 feet of flexible lamp (also called zip) cord
 Solder
 Electrical tape
Here are some notes to help you find these materials and parts:
 See the section “Gathering Your Materials” later in this chapter for some
suggestions on the materials that you may want to use to build the top
and bottom decks.
 You can purchase the Tamiya motors and wheels from Tower Hobbies
(www.towerhobbies.com), as well as many other local and online
hobby retailers. See the Appendix for a more complete list of sources.
 You can find the 11⁄4-inch caster at Lowe’s and many other home improve-
ment stores.
 Look for the DPDT switches, battery holder, and electrical items at
RadioShack, or most electronics supply stores.

Chapter 15: Cool Robot Projects to Amaze Your Friends and Family
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

The following sections give you more details about all of these parts and
materials and how you use them to build your robot.
The bits and pieces of a ‘bot
You don’t have to make your robot’s body elaborate to make it good. You can
make a simple and sturdy body by using common tools and readily available
materials. Simple design choices can save you headaches. You can build 
a square-shaped body more easily than a circular one because the square
needs only straight cuts. Cutting robot bodies from in-stock sizes of materials
saves you money, too.
You can also decide whether you want to be more or less meticulous about
how you construct your robot’s body. For a lot of folks, building the mechani-
cal body of a robot is akin to getting a root canal. They don’t like all the cut-
ting and sawing and drilling. So, they pull out the duct tape and invoke the
physics of stickum. Although these construction techniques have their place,
a sturdy and permanent body gives you a less hassle-prone robot, and things
don’t come off when they shouldn’t.
Introducing Rover the Robot
The Rover, which we talk about in this chapter, is a fairly simple robot that
gives you a perfect intro to robot building if you’re just starting out. You can
conveniently use the body of Rover for both projects in this chapter:
 In the basic Rover, you use two small DC gear motors to control its
movement by using a pair of wired switches. (Gear motors are like regu-
lar motors, except they also include a set of gears that make the motor
more useful for propelling things like small robots.) You can drive Rover
through the house by flipping the switches up and down. It’s a lot more
fun than it sounds, especially if you have a cat or dog to chase around.
(Don’t worry — no animals will be harmed during this project.)
 The advanced Rover uses a microcontroller, specifically the BASIC
Stamp 2, to build a self-contained, autonomous robot. With this version,
you program the microcontroller for what you want Rover to do. This
smart Rover uses specialized motors that you have to take apart and
modify. You can read about how to do that in the section “Modifying the
R/C servo motors” later in this chapter.

Preparing to Build the ‘Bot
Before you can drill your first hole or fasten your first nut, you need to lay
out the design of your robot, acquire all the materials, and sort out all the
parts you’re going to use.
First, get yourself a template
Although you use a circuit schematic for simpler projects, such as those in
Chapter 14, you graduate to something called a cutting and drilling template
for making a robot. This template serves as the layout for your robot. Draw
the layout to scale — that is, the same size and shape that you want the fin-
ished pieces to be — on a piece of paper. 
Figure 15-1 shows the cutting and drilling template for Rover, a two-deck
tabletop robot. The dimensions used in this template are measured in inches.
The template includes the two body pieces, which we call decks, like the decks
of a ship. There’s a bottom deck and a top deck. You attach the motors and
wheels to the bottom deck. The top deck is left free for future enhancements
(such as adding the microcontroller brains, detailed later in this chapter).

Chapter 15: Cool Robot Projects to Amaze Your Friends and Family

The two decks are attached together using risers, which are long pieces of
metal that are threaded to attach to machine screws. Read more about risers
in the section “Getting to know the pieces,” later in the chapter.
Gathering your materials
You need only rudimentary construction skills to build Rover using a variety of
materials for the deck pieces. These are the easiest to work with:
 1⁄4-inch hardwood plywood: A good choice is 5-ply “aircraft plywood,”
available at any hobby store.
 1⁄4-inch rigid expanded PVC sheet: Commonly referred to as PVCX,
Sintra, or Komatex. 
 1⁄8-inch acrylic plastic: You can buy this plastic at most plastics specialty
stores (you can find these by looking up “Plastics” in the Yellow Pages)
and at many home improvement stores.
Our favorite construction material for a robot body is rigid expanded PVC
because it’s strong but lightweight, relatively cheap, and easy to cut and drill.
You can sand it like wood, and, in fact, residential and commercial builders
often use it as a wood substitute. Rigid expanded PVC is great stuff, but hard-
ware and home improvement stores don’t stock it. Look for it at specialty
plastics outlets and sign-making shops. We provide some mail-order sources
of small pieces in the Appendix.
Our least favorite construction material is acrylic plastic, for a number of 
reasons:
 If you’re not careful, acrylic can shatter when you’re drilling or cutting it.
 Acrylic dulls tools rather quickly.
 Acrylic generates a ton of static electricity, which, as we point out in
Chapter 2, can damage sensitive electronics components.
Although acrylic plastic may not be the ideal material, you can use it in a
pinch if you have nothing else suitable around.
Getting to know the pieces
You construct Rover’s body with two pieces: a bottom deck and a top deck.
The bottom deck measures 6 by 61⁄2 inches, and you will cut out wells in it for
the tires. The top deck measures 6 by 41⁄2 inches, and it gives you enough room
to mount all kinds of electronics and other goodies on it.

The drive motors for Rover, which propel the robot across the floor, are
Tamiya worm gear motors (model number 72004). You can buy these parts at
Tower Hobbies and many other online resources; check the Appendix for a
list of some sources you can try. You buy the motor as a kit; you build it into
a compact, self-contained housing. The motor comes with a shaft that you
can attach to numerous styles of wheels.
Four risers separate the two deck pieces. You can use standoffs for the risers.
Standoffs are lengths of metal that have threads on either end to accept
common sizes of machine screws (these threaded ends are referred to as
‘female’). The longer the standoff, the greater the distance between the two
decks. You can get standoffs at electronics supply stores. Or, you can use 2-
or 11⁄2-inch long 6-32 machine screws that you can get at most hardware or
home improvement stores.
Keep these points in mind when choosing what to use as risers:
 When using standoffs as risers, the minimum length that you can use is
1⁄2-inch; 1- or 11⁄2-inch standoffs work even better.
 If you’re using machine screws as risers, remember that the length of the
screw must accommodate whatever distance you want between the
deck pieces, plus the thickness of the deck piece material, plus the thick-
ness of the retaining nut. For example, if you want 1 inch of clearance,
and you’re using 1⁄4-inch thick wood or PVC, then the machine screws
must be at least 13⁄4 inches. The remaining 1/4” is just enough for you to
fasten a nut at the end of the screw.
329
Chapter 15: Cool Robot Projects to Amaze Your Friends and Family
Getting savvy about machine screw sizes
In the United States and a few other places in
the world, folks express machine screw size as
two sets of numbers, such as 6-32. Here’s what
those numbers mean:
 The first number: This number represents
the diameter of the screw. The smaller this
number, the smaller the screw. (Screws that
are 1⁄4-inch or larger in diameter drop the
number and just use the actual size, such as
3⁄8- or 5⁄16-inch.)
 The second number: This number repre-
sents the threads per inch of the screw.
So, a 6-32 machine screw has a diameter
defined as #6 (you don’t have to worry about
what that translates to, just get the one your
project calls for or the one that fits), with 32
threads per inch. Other common screw sizes
are 4-40, 8-32, and 10-24. In addition to the
screw size, you need to know the length of the
screw, such as 1⁄2- or 3⁄4-inch, as well as the type
of head on the screw. A screw you often use in
building small robots has a round head.
You use a similar numbering scheme with
metric screws, but the sizes and threads are
expressed in millimeters rather than inches.

Building the Body of the ‘Bot
Now that you have your building plan and materials in hand, you’re ready to
actually start construction. So put on your hard hat, and read on! (Oh, and
don’t forget to grab safety glasses to protect your eyes.)
Cutting and drilling the 
pieces of a robot body
The first step in the building process is to use the robot layout from Figure
15-1 to drill holes for mounting parts, and then cut out the deck pieces.
Follow these simple steps to make the body pieces for your Rover robot:
1. Lay out the holes and cutting dimensions from the template in Figure
15-1 directly on the wood or plastic material. Or better yet, draw them
first on a piece of paper, then tape the paper over the wood or plastic
material you are using for the decks.
2. When all looks right, drill the holes for Rover using a 1⁄8-inch drill bit.
You can use a hand drill (manual or motorized), but a drill press helps
you to make more accurate holes. The distance and alignment of the
four holes that you use to mount the two motors are the most critical.
3. After you finish drilling, cut the pieces to size. 
You can use a hacksaw (see Figure 15-2), coping saw, jigsaw, band saw,
or scroll saw — whatever you happen to have in your shop. We prefer
the scroll saw because it provides more control.
4. Sand down the corners of the pieces to produce a beveled edge. This
removes the sharp angles at each corner.
Use a motorized sander, such as the one that you see in Figure 15-3, to
remove the sharp corners. But if you don’t have this tool, use a sandpa-
per block with 60- or 80-grit paper and a little elbow grease to get the 
job done.
When you saw pieces without the benefit of a straight edge, you should cut a
little outside the line that you marked onto the paper layout or material and
then clean up any irregularities with a file or sandpaper block.

Assembling and mounting the motors
Set aside the body pieces for now and turn to assembling the two gear motors.
You put these motors together by following the instructions that come with
your motor kits. Use a #1 Phillips screwdriver to assemble the motors; note
that the screwdriver doesn’t come in the kit, so you’ll need to buy one if you
don’t already have it. You also need a small hex key wrench. You’ll be happy
to hear that the hex key wrench does come as a part of your motor kit.
Figure 15-4 shows how the gear motors should look when you’ve assembled
them.
Attach the two motors to the bottom deck using some 6-32 screws and nuts.
Refer to Figure 15-5, which shows you how to line up the motors with the
holes in the bottom deck of your robot.

Doing a wheelie
With the motors attached, it’s time to secure the wheels in place. Putting the
wheels for your little robot buddy together involves two steps — mounting
an axle to the gear motor, and then attaching the wheels to that axle.
You get two styles of metal axle in the gear motor kit, one with and one with-
out a hole on each end for a roll pin. (A roll pin is a small stick of metal that
comes with the gear motor kit. It’s tiny, so be careful not to lose it!) You use
the axle that has the holes to build your robot. You can throw the other axle
in your junk bin, ready for another project. 
You have several options for the wheel, but our favorite is the Narrow Tire
set (model number 70145), which comes with two 58-millimeter diameter
rubber tires (about 21⁄2 inches). Tamiya has included a hub that fits over the
roll pin. You hold the wheel in place using a small hex nut, which also comes
with the tire set. The wheels come as their own kit; follow their instructions
to assemble them. Then, construct the second motor/wheel as a mirror image
to the first.

Chapter 15: Cool Robot Projects to Amaze Your Friends and Family

When you use narrow tires, the motor shaft is a tad too long to fit in the
space between each motor. You can easily fix this problem by cutting a small
slit in the notch near the end of the motor shaft (opposite the end with the
hole) and then breaking the end of the shaft off, using heavy-duty pliers.
Attach the two motors to the robot, using 4-40 by 1⁄2-inch machine screws and
4-40 nuts. Refer to Figure 15-6 to see how the motors and wheels should look
after you attach them to the robot.
Mounting the caster
A swivel caster supports the base of the Rover robot, and is located on the
opposite end from the gear motors and wheels. A standard 11⁄4-inch ball-bearing
caster, which you can buy at Lowe’s and other home improvement stores,
works fine. Don’t use a larger or heavier duty caster because these big boys
weigh the robot down and don’t swivel easily.

and wheels

Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

You attach the caster by using 6-32 by 1⁄2-inch machine screws and nuts, as
you can see in Figure 15-7. The drilling holes in the layout (see Figure 15-1)
differ in size and spacing depending on the model of caster that you use. Your
best bet is to trace the holes that you need to drill by using the caster base
plate as a guide.
Adding the second deck
What you have at this point may look sort of like an open-faced sandwich
robot. The next step, which completes the robot sandwich, is to add the top
deck. You can add the second deck by using your choice of risers.
You can see the robot you’ve built so far, which still doesn’t have any elec-
tronics, in Figure 15-8.

Control switches
If you’ve gone through the preceding sections in this chapter, you’ve almost
completed your Rover assembly. One last finishing touch, and you can start
playing with it. Before you can play, Rover needs a power source in the form
of a battery and a couple of switches so that you can control the operation of
the motors.
Take a look at Figure 15-9. This diagram shows you how to hook up a battery
to two double-pole double-throw toggle switches. This diagram also shows
you how to wire the switches so that flipping a switch forward powers the
motors one way and flipping the switch backward reverses the direction of
the motor.
Follow these steps to hook up the battery to switches:
1. Solder an 8 to 10 foot length of lamp cord wire from the center termi-
nals of each switch to the left and right motor of the Rover.
2. Solder the leads from a four-cell AA battery holder to the switches. 
The red wire and the black wire from the battery holder should connect
to the terminals on both switches, as shown in Figure 15-9.

3. Solder the remaining “jumpers” between the switch terminals, as
shown in the figure. 
These jumpers form an X shape. When you wire them in this way, the
switches reverse the polarity of the voltage from the battery as you
toggle them from one position to the other.

4. Drill two 3/8” (or so) holes in a piece of 4” x 4” x 1/4” plastic or wood. 
The holes should be near the top of the plastic or wood piece, to allow
room for the battery holder, which you’ll place underneath. The exact
size of hole depends on the mounting requirements of the switches
you’re using. The holes should be just large enough for the shaft of the
switch to fit through. 
5. Use the retaining nuts that come with the switches to secure the
switches to the plastic or wood.
6. Place the switches in their center/off position.
7. Put four AA batteries in the battery holder. 
8. Use tape (electrical tape or duct tape works best) to secure the battery
holder to the piece of plastic or wood. 
Tuck some of the wire leading from the switches to the robot inside the
tape. This acts as a kind of strain relief, and prevents the robot from
pulling its wires out of the switches.
For best results, solder all connections and then use insulating electrical 
tape to cover any exposed wires. Wrap tape several times around each wire
where it connects to each motor. This tape layer helps to keep the wires from
pulling out.
To control the Rover, use your thumbs to push the switches back and forth.
Release the switch, and it returns to its center, which is the off position.
When the switch is off, the motor that the switch is connected to stops.
Because you mount the motors in mirror image, to go forward (or backward),
one motor turns clockwise and the other motor turns counter-clockwise.
Rotate the switches on the wood or plastic so that you can press both
switches forward with one motion to move the robot forward and press both
switches backward to reverse direction.
Driving Miss Rover
After going through the setup in the preceding sections in this chapter, you
can take your robot out for a spin. You steer Rover like this:
 Make your robot turn by pushing one switch forward and the other
switch back.
 Press the switches to get the robot to move forward, go backward, or
make turns.

The arrows on the wheels of the robot representation in Figure 15-10 show
you the direction that you flip the switches to achieve the motion that you
want. In this figure there are only two wheels; we’ve added a caster at the

Giving Rover Some Smarts
You control the basic Rover, which you can read about in the previous sec-
tions, by wire. You can have some fun driving Rover around the den, but some
folks would say you don’t have a true “robot” because it doesn’t think on its
own. Well, you can add a brain to Rover with way less effort than you may
think. All it takes is a few changes to the motors so that they can accept elec-
tronic commands, the addition of a sensor or two to tell the robot that it’s
run up against an obstacle, and a microcontroller to tell the robot what to do
when it does hit a snag (or a chair, or a wall).
To program your robot, you need to use a microcontroller. At the heart of the
Smart Rover is a BASIC Stamp 2 microcontroller. We introduce these puppies
in Chapter 13. If microcontrollers are a new concept to you, you can go and
leaf through that chapter to get a feel for them.
For this project we assume that you have plugged a BASIC Stamp 2 into a BOE
development board. (For more about these two items, read the next section
or head back to Chapter 13.)
Mulling over microcontrollers
If you feel confident enough in your microcontroller knowledge to go on, we
quickly recap:
 A microcontroller is a computer in the form of a chip that you connect
to your robot through I/O (input/output) ports. By downloading pro-
grams from the computer to the robot, you can literally control the
robot’s actions.
 You program the microcontroller just as you program a desktop com-
puter. You tell the microcontroller what to do, and it tells the robot.
 You write this program on your PC and then download it to the micro-
controller, usually through a serial or USB cable.
 After you download the program into the microcontroller, it’s stored in
non-volatile memory, and here the program stays until you replace it
with another program. The program remains in memory, even when you
turn the power off and remove the batteries.
In Chapter 13, we discuss a nifty little microcontroller named the BASIC Stamp
2, from Parallax. This microcontroller was designed with the beginning robot
builder in mind. The BASIC Stamp 2 is a 24-pin integrated circuit. You can use
this integrated circuit right out of the box in your projects, or stick it into a
340
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

development board, such as Parallax’s Board of Education (BOE) to allow you
to easily experiment with the BASIC Stamp. Chapter 13 also describes the BOE
in more detail, so check it out to get more background.
DC motors out, R/C servo motors in
Before you get to program a microcontroller, you have to use different motors
so that you can control them electronically. The basic Rover that we describe
in the first project in this chapter uses two DC gear motors. These motors
work ideally for switch control, allowing you to readily change the direction
of the motor just by flipping a lever. But these kinds of motors need a bit more
circuitry before you can operate them electronically. Specifically, they need an
H-bridge, which does electronically pretty much what mechanical switches do
in the basic Rover. 
We promise not to make you buy or build an H-bridge; instead, use two inex-
pensive (about $10 to $12 each) servo motors that are designed for use in
radio-controlled (R/C) gadgets such as model airplanes. The BASIC Stamp 2 can
operate these motors directly, without any additional circuitry.
You can see an example R/C servo motor in Figure 15-11.

A typical
standard-
size R/C
servo motor.

Going inside a servo motor
So what’s inside a servo motor? Servo motors that you use for radio-controlled
planes and cars consist of some control electronics, a motor, a couple of gears,
and a variable resistor (potentiometer).
Here’s how all of these parts work together:
 The control electronics are there to receive a signal from a radio control
receiver (or in our case, the BASIC Stamp microcontroller) to activate
the motor.
 The motor turns. The motor runs pretty quickly, and your robot can’t run
that fast, so the action of a series of gears reduces the motor’s speed.
 Connect the potentiometer to the final output gear. This gear protrudes
outside of the servo motor and connects to a linkage, wheel, or what-
ever. As this output gear turns, so does the potentiometer. The position
of the potentiometer tells the control electronics the position of the
output gear.
Going shopping for servos
First things first — you need to go out and buy your servo motors. You can
find more than a half-dozen major manufacturers of R/C servo motors, and
each manufacturer offers a multitude of models. But when it comes to adapt-
ing a servo motor for robotics, only three servos stand out from the crowd 
as both affordable and easy to modify:
 Futaba S148
 Grand Wing Servo (GWS) S03 and S06
 Hitec HS-422
These servos share a common trait — they use a small retainer clip on the
underside of the output gear to engage with the potentiometer. You can most
easily modify this type of servo. When you remove the clip, the output gear
no longer turns the potentiometer shaft. (You also need to clip with snippers
or file off a molded-in ridge on the top of the output gear. This ridge serves as
a physical stop to prevent the output gear from turning more than about 270
degrees.)
342
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Making servos serviceable
Now you have your servo motors, but there’s a fly in the ointment: The manu-
facturers designed the R/C servo motor to move back and forth about 90
degrees in each direction, and no more. To operate a robot, you need to con-
vert the motor for continuous rotation so the wheels don’t just stop at 90
degrees. Happily, this job isn’t tough, as long as you choose the right kind of
servo. (You can read more about how to modify an R/C servo motor in the
following section.)
The benefit of modifying an R/C servo motor is that you don’t need to monkey
around with additional interface electronics to use the motor with a micro-
controller, such as the BASIC Stamp 2. In addition, R/C servo motors are fairly
low-priced, as motors go. These two facts make modifying servo motors well
worth your while.
An unmodified servo allows precise positioning of the output gear. In a modi-
fied servo, you sever the link between the potentiometer and the output gear.
The output gear then turns freely, without stopping.
After you modify a servo, you can simply plug it into sockets on the BOE, and it
works like a charm. You need to write some programming code to operate the
servo, but don’t worry, we show you just what to do in the following sections.
Once you’ve done these modifications, the motors can now turn the wheels
to steer Smart Rover (as shown in Figure 15-10) and move it around your
living room.
Modifying the R/C servo motors
Here’s what you need to modify any one of the servos that we recommend in
the section “Going shopping for servos” earlier in this chapter:
 #0 Phillips screwdriver
 1⁄8-inch or smaller flat-bladed screwdriver
 Nippy cutters, X-ACTO blade, or razor saw
 Small flat jeweler’s file
After you modify a servo, you void its warranty, so be sure that you have a
good ‘un first. Test the servo for proper operation by plugging it into a micro-
controller and sending it a command (see the section “Putting the program in
place” later in this chapter for more about how to do this) before you modify
it. Though it happens only rarely, a servo may fail right out of the box.
343
Chapter 15: Cool Robot Projects to Amaze Your Friends and Family

Throughout the following steps, take care to avoid wiping off too much of 
the lubricant that you use for the servo’s internal gears. Otherwise the servo
gears may not have enough lubrication for smooth operation. If you think
you’ve lost too much of the lubricant, you can always add more just prior to
re-assembling the motor. You can get servo grease at the same hobby store
where you bought the servo motors.
Now, you’re ready to make the actual modifications to your servo. We wrote
the following steps for the Hitec HS-422 servo, but you can modify most other
servos using the retaining clip design in much the same way:
1. Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the servo disc, if it attaches to
the output gear/shaft.
2. Loosen the four casing screws from the bottom of the servo (see Fig-
ure 15-12).
3. Remove the screws completely so that you can set the servo base down
on the table while you’re working inside it.
On a few servos, notably the GWS S03, you remove the case screws from
the top, not the bottom.
4. Remove the top portion of the servo and observe how all the gears
are oriented so you can put things back the same way when you’re
done.
Look at Figure 15-13 for an example of what the innards of a servo 
look like.
Figure 15-12:
Taking the
servo apart.
344
Part V: A Plethora of Projects 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

5. Remove the center gear, being careful not to unseat its metal shaft,
and place the center gear aside.
On the Hitec HS-422, you can’t easily remove the center gear without
also lifting up the output gear, so carefully lift (and then replace) the
output gear, if you need to.
6. Remove the output gear.
7. Use a small pair of pliers to set the potentiometer at its center posi-
tion, as you can see in Figure 15-14.
8. Remove the ridge on the top side of the output gear by using the
nippy cutters (see Figure 15-15), an X-ACTO blade, or a razor saw.
Exercise caution! The harder the plastic, the more likely it is that the
ridge will break suddenly and fly off. Wear eye protection. Always nip
first on the long side to prevent the output gear from breaking. When
using an X-ACTO blade or razor saw, observe the obvious precautions
against cutting your fingers off. If you’re using cutters, chip off small
amounts of the ridge at a time, instead of trying to clip it off all at once.
Otherwise, the pressure of the cutter can cause the output gear to
break apart.

matter what cutting technique you use; do this filing with a small, flat
file (see Figure 15-16).

10. Remove the metal retaining ring from the underside of the output
gear (Figure 15-17), using the small-bladed screwdriver.
This ring holds the potentiometer shaft clip and supports the output gear.
11. Use the small-bladed screwdriver again to remove the potentiometer
shaft clip, as shown in Figure 15-18.
12. Place the metal retaining ring back into the output gear.
13. Replace the output gear on its seat, resting over the potentiometer.
14. Replace the middle gear and make sure that all gears mesh properly.
15. Add more grease at this point, if necessary.
16. Finally, put the top case back on and screw in the four case screws.
Mounting the servos to the Rover
R/C servo motors have a screw flange that you can use to mount them per-
manently, but for the Smart Rover, just stick on some double-sided tape or
Velcro to get the job done.

We like to use a Velcro-like material called Dual Lock. 3M makes it, and you
can find it at discount department stores, such as Target, and some hardware
stores. Dual Lock works better at holding the parts of your robot together
than Velcro because it doesn’t permit as much side-to-side slippage.
Attach a piece of Dual Lock to the side of a servo. Stick a mating chunk of
Dual Lock on the underside of Rover’s bottom deck and squeeze the two
pieces together to make a solid joint.
Figure 15-19 shows you what the servo looks like when you’ve mounted it on
the Rover.
When you attach the servos to your Rover, make sure that you get both servos
on straight. Otherwise, the robot may wobble around the room like a toddler
learning to walk. Be sure to leave enough clearance for the wheels; otherwise
the wheels may scrape against the robot.

Putting Your Servos on 
a Roll with Wheels
The motors on Rover have one reason for being — to move the wheels and
make the thing go. For the next step, after you attach the servo motors to the
robot body (which we talk about in the preceding section), you have to
attach wheels to the motors.
Several online and mail-order outfits, such as www.budgetrobotics.com
and www.solarbotics.com, sell 21⁄2-inch diameter wheels that you can attach
directly to an R/C servo motor. (You can make your own wheels, but servo-
ready wheels don’t cost much, and are easy to use, so why bother?) Find
some wheels that you like, and be sure to buy two. When you buy wheels,
select the correct type for the servo that you’re using. The mounting hub dif-
fers ever-so-slightly between Futaba and Hitec servos, so get two wheels of
the same brand.
Servos made by Grand Wind (GWS) and Parallax use Futaba hubs. For these
models, you have to purchase Futaba-style wheels.
Use a small screw inserted in the center hole of the wheel to attach the
wheels to the output shaft of the servo; this screw comes with the servo.
Figure 15-20 shows the Rover with wheels attached to the servo.

Sensing Things with a 
Bumper Car Switch
Rolling around the room all day is well and good, but eventually Rover smashes
into the dining room table. That’s where the bumper car switch comes in. The
Smart Rover uses this small spring-operated leaf switch to help it figure out
that it’s run into something. The switch is a long bar located at the front of the
robot, so that when the Rover hits something, the switch is triggered and the
program running on the Rover’s BASIC Stamp (more about this program in the
section “Putting the program in place” later in this chapter) causes the robot to
back up a short distance and then go the other way.
You can get an SPST spring-loaded leaf switch at almost any electronics parts
store. You don’t need to worry about size, as long as you have a switch big
enough to mount to the front of the robot with double-sided tape, Velcro, or
Dual Lock.
Figure 15-21 shows a diagram of a leaf switch with a three-inch length of 1/16”
diameter brass piano wire soldered onto the leaf (but you can also just glue it
on). The rod acts to extend the lever of the switch so that the Rover has a
larger bumper contact area. You can buy piano wire at any hardware or
hobby store.
Many leaf switches are SPDT. They have three terminals: common, normally
open (NO), and normally closed (NC). These terminals work well for the
Smart Rover. Just be sure to connect the common and NO (normally open)
terminals and leave the NC terminal alone (we go into the procedure for this
in the next section).
Figure 15-22 shows you where to mount the switch on the front of your Rover.

You use I/O ports 12 (labeled P12 in Figure 15-24) and 14 (labeled P14) to
communicate between the BOE and the servos. Port 12 is located on pin 17
and Port 14 is located on pin 19 of the BASIC Stamp 2 chip.(Note that only
pin numbers for the four corner pins are indicated in this figure.) Be sure to
review the documentation that comes with your BOE for more information on
the BASIC Stamp’s I/O ports, pins, and other features. 
You can access the I/O pins at a special jack on the BOE, as Figure 15-25 shows.
The jack is designed to accept the connectors used on R/C servo motors. You
just plug the connectors into the sockets marked 12 and 14, and you’re all
set. Easy as pie!

Making Switch and Power Connections
Along with the switch you added in the earlier section, “Sensing things with 
a bumper car switch,” you add an LED to Rover so that you get a visual alert
when the switch is triggered. You wire the leaf switch to the board using the
same connection that we detail in Chapter 13. Take a look at the section
“Adding a Switch to the Mix” in Chapter 13 for more information about how
to hook up a switch to the BASIC Stamp Board of Education.
The Smart Rover program that we go into in the following section also uses
the LED indicator that we cover in Chapter 13. 
Servo motors use up more current than a 9-volt battery provides. Use 4 AA
batteries in a battery holder, rather than a single 9-volt battery. You use a
special power plug with the BOE that you can buy at RadioShack or other
electronics stores. Or, you can purchase a AA battery holder from Parallax
with the proper power plug already attached; you can visit their Web page at
www.parallax.com.
Don’t get a battery that exceeds 6 volts, or you may damage the servo
motors. Servo motors are designed to run at between 4.8 and 6 volts. Four
rechargeable AA cells provide 4.8 volts; four alkaline AA cells provide 6 volts.

out the program listing below. It shows you how the program operates the
two servos and reacts to the leaf switch:
 The program starts both servos, propelling the robot forward.
 If the robot hits something, the impact triggers the switch, and the pro-
gram reverses one of the motors.
 The program reverses that motor for about three quarters of a second,
which makes the robot spin around.
 The robot moves forward again until it, inevitably, hits something else.
Putting the program in place
In this section, we give you the program that you need to get your Rover
rolling. Enter it into the BASIC Stamp editor, as we describe in Chapter 13,
and run the program when you’re done; this uploads it to your ‘bot.
Don’t forget that you need to connect your PC to the Board of Education
through a serial or USB cable, depending on the BOE version you have. Read
Chapter 13 for the complete picture.

Looking at the program up-close
Taking a closer look at how the Smart Rover program works helps you become
more programming savvy. Here’s a blow-by-blow description of what each line
does:
‘ {$STAMP BS2}
This line tells the BASIC Stamp editor that you’re using BASIC Stamp 2.
OUTPUT 0
This line tells the BASIC Stamp to treat I/O port 0 as an output. The indicator
LED connects to I/O port 0, and the program control turns the LED on and off.
btn   VAR   Byte
cnt   VAR   Byte
These lines set up the BASIC Stamp with two variables. These variables ensure
that temporary data is stored until it’s used again later in the program.
loop:
This line is the main loop of the program. It tells the BASIC Stamp to repeat
the instructions from this point to the GOTO loop instruction at the bottom
of the program. These instructions repeat over and over again. Get used to
this command if you plan to do much ‘bot building — almost all robot control
programs have one.
PULSOUT 12,1000     ‘ motor A
PULSOUT 14,500      ‘ motor B
Pulses operate R/C servos. The length of the pulse determines the direction
of travel. The PULSOUT programming statement sends a pulse of a specified
duration to the indicated I/O port. For example, PULSOUT 12,1000 sends a
2,000-microsecond pulse to I/O port 12. (You specify the pulse duration in 
2-microsecond increments: 1000 in the code equals 2000 microseconds.) But,
hey, motor A pulses at 2000 microseconds, while motor B pulses for only
1000 microseconds. Why? Because you mount the motors in mirror image. 
To move the robot forward, one motor has to turn clockwise, and the other
turns counter-clockwise.

This line tells the BASIC Stamp to wait a brief period of time, specifically 15
milliseconds.
BUTTON 1,0,255,250,btn,0,noSwitch
The BUTTON statement tells the BASIC Stamp to check the state of the switch
connected to I/O pin 1. The BUTTON statement requires a bunch of additional
options, which you can find in the BASIC Stamp documentation that came
with your BASIC Stamp kit. We discuss this programming statement more
fully in Chapter 13.

Setting the exact center of your servos
When an unmodified R/C servo motor receives
a series of pulses 1000 microseconds long, it
moves as far as it can go in one direction. When
it receives a series of pulses 2000 microseconds
long, it moves as far as it can go in the other
direction. As you may have guessed, when R/C
servos receive a series of pulses 1500
microseconds long, the motors move to the
center position. Makes sense, doesn’t it?
When you modify your two servos, as we
describe in the “Modifying the R/C servo motors”
section of this chapter, you set the potentiome-
ter to its center position. Well, there’s physical
center, and then there’s electrical center. You
only move the potentiometer to its center phys-
ical position, but not its electrical center posi-
tion. You can make your Rover easier to control
by setting the potentiometer to its electrical
center. You do this Rover taming by running a
short program and turning the potentiometer
until all motor activity stops. Of course, you have
to disassemble the servos again to reach the
potentiometer.
Here’s the program to use for this positioning
(the program assumes that you have the servos
connected to the Board of Education, as we dis-
cuss in the “Connecting Up to the Board of
Education” section in this chapter):
‘ {$STAMP BS2}
loop:               ‘ define start of
loop
PULSOUT 12,750    ‘ motor A
PULSOUT 14,750    ‘ motor B
PAUSE 15          ‘ wait 15
milliseconds
GOTO loop         ‘ repeat loop
This program is pretty simple. It sends out an
endless stream of 1500-microsecond pulses to
both servos. While it’s sending these pulses,
adjust the potentiometer until the motors stop.
Mind you, you don’t absolutely need to do this
step, but you may find it handy if you ever
decide to delve deeper into the black art of
robot building.
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

These programming statements run if, and only if, the switch is triggered. The
OUT0 = btn statement turns the LED on. The FOR/NEXT loop repeats the three
statements that follow a total of 50 times. After the 50th iteration, the program
continues. The pulsing causes one of the servos to reverse, so the Rover spins
around and heads off in a new direction.
OUT0 = 0
noSwitch: GOTO loop
After the robot turns around, the LED turns off (as the first line above tells it
to), and the main loop repeats itself (according to the command in the
second line).
Where Can I Go from Here?
Obviously, you can discover much more about controlling robots using a
BASIC Stamp or other microcontroller. If you’re interested (and why wouldn’t
you be?!), check out the documentation that comes with your BASIC Stamp.
That information includes several robot-related examples. Parallax, the
makers of the BASIC Stamp, also offer several robot-programming tutorials
and kits that you may find very handy.
And, lastly, don’t forget the rich sea of the Internet. Although you can some-
times have trouble finding exactly what you want while swimming around out
there, persistent use of search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, help you
dig up wonderful chestnuts of robot info when you search with terms such as
“robot” or “robotics”.

kay, so you’re ready to graduate to the electronics big time. But you
can’t do it alone. You need a laboratory full of impressive-looking gear
with blinky lights, bright knobs, and spinning dials. You’re ready to go out
and acquire some of the neat specialized test equipment that we describe in
this chapter.
You don’t absolutely, positively need these tools just to play around with some
LEDs and resistors. A basic multimeter, and maybe a logic probe, are all you
need for that. Consider acquiring the additional test gear in this chapter after
you’ve gained some experience in electronics and want to graduate to bigger
and better projects. Unless you’re independently wealthy, just purchase test
equipment as you need it.

Put a Pulse Here, Put a Pulse There
The logic pulser is a handy troubleshooting accessory for when you work
with digital circuits. This handheld tool, which you can see in Figure 16-1,
puts out a timed high or low digital pulse, letting you see the effect of the
pulse on your digital circuit. (A pulse is simply a signal that alternates between
high and low very rapidly.) Such a pulse might be used to trigger some por-
tion of a circuit that is not otherwise working, for example — you can think of
it as a way to “jump start” a cranky circuit. You can switch the pulser between
one pulse and continuous pulsing. Normally, you’d use the pulser with a logic
probe or an oscilloscope. (You can read about both logic probes and oscillo-
scopes in Chapter 10.)
Most pulsers get their power from the circuit that you’re testing. You need to
remember this fact because, with digital circuits, you generally don’t want to
present an input signal to a device that’s greater than the supply voltage for
the device. In other words, if a chip is powered by five volts, and you give it 
a 12-volt pulse, you ruin the chip.
Figure 16-1:
Logic
pulsers feed

362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Be sure that you don’t pulse a line that has an output but no input. Some inte-
grated circuits are sensitive to unloaded pulses at their output stages, and you
can destroy the chip by applying the pulse improperly. (An unloaded pulse
means that the current from the pulse has no way to safely drain to another
part of the circuit. If the current is applied to an output of an integrated circuit,
for example, that output could be damaged because it is exposed to current it’s
not meant to take.)
Some circuits work with split (+, –, and ground) power supplies, so make sure
that you connect the leads of the pulser to the correct power points to avoid
damage to the components.
Counting Up Those Megahertz
A frequency counter (or frequency meter) tests the frequency of a signal. You
use a frequency counter to verify that a circuit is operating correctly. For
example, suppose you create an infrared transmitter and the light from the
transmitter is supposed to pulse at 40,000 cycles per second (40 kHz). With a
frequency counter connected to the circuit, you can verify that the circuit is
indeed producing pulses at 40 kHz, not 32 kHz, 110 kHz, or some other Hz. 
You can use most models, such as the one in Figure 16-2, on digital, analog,
and most RF circuits (radio transmitters and receivers are typical RF [radio
frequency] circuits). For most hobby work, you need only a basic frequency
counter; a $100 or $150 model should do just fine. And, some of the newer
multimeters also have a rudimentary frequency counting feature.

363
Chapter 16: Ten (Or So) Cool Electronics Testing Tool Tips
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

In a digital circuit, signals are limited to a range of zero up to about 12 volts.
Voltages can vary widely in an analog circuit. Most frequency counters are
designed to work with analog voltages ranging from a few hundred millivolts
to 12 or more volts. Check the manual that came with your frequency counter
for specifics.
Frequency counters display the frequency signal from 0 (zero) Hertz (cycles
per second), to a maximum limit that is based on the design of the counter.
This limit usually goes well into the megahertz; it’s not uncommon to find an
upper limit of 25 to 50 MHz. Higher-priced frequency counter models come
with a prescaler or offer one as an option. A prescaler is a device that extends
the useful operating frequency of the frequency counter to much higher
limits. Go for the prescaler feature if you’re working with high frequency
radio gear or computers.
A Power Supply with a Changeable
Personality
You use a power supply to replace batteries while building and testing cir-
cuits at your workbench. A variable power supply provides a well-regulated
voltage output, generally ranging from 0 to 20 volts. The model in Figure 16-3
offers a variable output range of about 2 to 20 volts, as well as preset outputs
of –5, +5, and +12 volts. 
Figure 16-3:
A variable
power
supply.
364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

In addition to the voltage output of a power supply, pay attention to the cur-
rent capacity. The higher the current rating of the supply, the more stuff it can
power. Avoid a power supply with only a modest current output — say, less
than one amp. You can’t adequately drive all circuits with lower currents.
Consider a power supply that delivers a minimum of two amps at +5 volts
and at least one amp at any other voltage.
Making All Kinds of Signals
A function generator creates nearly pure signal waveforms for testing and 
calibration purposes. These gizmos are handy when you need to provide a
known signal from one circuit to another circuit you’re working on. For exam-
ple, it’s not uncommon to build circuits in stages, one piece at a time. Maybe
you’re building a little transmitter and receiver that work using just light,
rather than radio frequency waves. You start with the receiver portion. The
function generator can temporarily serve as your transmitter. When you get
the receiver done, you can build the transmitter, knowing, thanks to the func-
tion generator, that the receiver is working properly.
Most function generators develop three kinds of waveforms: sine, triangle,
and square. You can adjust the frequency of the waveforms from a low of 1 Hz
to a high of between 20 and 50 kHz.
You need a frequency counter to accurately time a waveform. Some function
generators come with a frequency counter built-in. If you have a stand-alone
frequency counter, you can use it to fine-tune the output of the function 
generator.
Calling All Alien Worlds
A sweep generator is a type of function generator, but with a cool twist. A
sweep generator produces signals that are somewhat different from the ones
that a standard generator puts out, in that it sweeps the frequencies up and
down. Not only does this sweep sound like E.T. calling home (connect a
speaker to the output of the sweep generator to hear this effect), but it also
helps you find frequency-sensitive problems in your circuits.
So what is this frequency-sensitive thing? Frequency-sensitive means that a
circuit is sensitive to specific frequencies. Because of that characteristic, a
circuit may function perfectly well at one frequency, but not at another. This
365

TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

would be bad for something like a radio receiver, which needs to operate
over a range of frequencies. If you produce a range by sweeping the frequen-
cies, you can more quickly see if your circuit is operating under all the condi-
tions that you want it to.
A sweep generator varies the frequency of the output waveform, typically
within pre-selected limits, such as 100 Hz to 1 kHz or 1 kHz to 20 kHz. You
most often use sweep generators in troubleshooting audio and video equip-
ment, where altering the frequency reveals bad components.
Some function generators also have a sweep feature, covering two functions
with one tool.
Analyze This
A logic analyzer is like a souped-up oscilloscope (you can read about oscillo-
scopes in Chapter 10). It shows you the waveforms of several inputs or out-
puts of a digital circuit at the same time. You most often use a logic analyzer
to test digital gadgets, and those folks well versed in the black arts of elec-
tronics find this analyzer useful.
One way you can use a logic analyzer is to check clock and data signals for a
microcontroller. These devices require very specific timing relationships for
various signals that you feed into them simultaneously. The logic analyzer
lets you freeze-frame all the signals. Then you can see if a signal is missing or
doesn’t sync up with the others, as it should.
If you think that you’re ready to try a logic analyzer, you can buy a stand-alone
model or one that connects to your PC. Stand-alone units cost a pretty penny,
and they’re very sophisticated. Consider getting a less expensive logic ana-
lyzer adapter for your PC. These adapters connect to the USB, serial, or par-
allel ports of your computer. You need special software that comes with the
adapter. Most PC-based logic analyzers handle between 8 and 16 digital
inputs at one time.
A Trio of Testing Toys
Here are three testing tools that are somewhat specialized, but if you know a
bit about them, you can impress people in electronics discussion forums. Oh,
and you may just need one or more of them in a project someday!
366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Here are the three tools:
 Spectrum analyzer: This tool lets you actually see radio waves. Well, to
be precise, you don’t see the waves, but you see the radio energy cre-
ated by them. The energy appears as a “spike” on an oscilloscope-like
display. People sometimes use spectrum analyzers in amateur radio
work to determine if a transmitter is on the fritz.
 Signal injector: This one literally injects a signal into an analog circuit.
You use one of these puppies to test whether radios and televisions are
in working order. You listen for the signal using a signal tracer or meter.
You use the signal injector and tracer like you’d use the continuity test
you perform with a multimeter, but this test goes further. To the trained
ear (yes, these gadgets take some skill to use properly), you can tell just
by the tone if components in the circuit may be bad.
 Static meter: If you have read much of this book at all, you know that
static electricity can cause all kinds of problems for electronics compo-
nents. You can use a static meter to scope out dangerous levels of static
electricity on or near your workbench. If you get high readings, you can
take steps to minimize the static. Remember that sensitive electronic
components and static don’t mix! Be sure to check out Chapter 2 for
additional tips on reducing static electricity.
Where to Get Testing Tool Deals
I won’t kid you — electronics test equipment can cost you a lot of money.
Much of what you pay for is the accuracy of the device. Manufacturers of this
or that doodad strive for high accuracy to tout their product in the market or
meet necessary government regulations. If you’re an electronics hobbyist
working at home, you don’t really need a very high level of accuracy. Usually
you can get by with less expensive models.
When you buy any test gear, especially the special-purpose stuff mentioned
in this chapter, don’t automatically go for the high-priced spread. A pricey
doohickey can’t make you a better electronics tech. The low-end model is
likely to be good enough for most hobby applications, and assuming that you
take good care of it, it should last many years.
You also don’t need to buy everything brand new. Used and surplus items
can save you a ton of cash on electronics test equipment. Buying used and
surplus has one disadvantage — most of this stuff doesn’t come with instruc-
tion manuals. Sometimes you can buy the manual separately, or you may be
able to find it online. Owners of popular test gear often scan the pages of
their old equipment manuals and post them online for the benefit of others.
367
Chapter 16: Ten (Or So) Cool Electronics Testing Tool Tips
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Check out these sources for used equipment:
 eBay and other online auction sites: Before you bid, check out other
auctions, including those that have already ended, to see what the going
price is for similar products. Set your bid accordingly, and use a proxy
bidding feature so that you don’t have to stay glued to your computer to
stay on top of the bidding.
 Electronics mail order and local surplus outlets: These outlets are
another good source for used test equipment and are handy if you don’t
want to wait for an auction to finish or you prefer to know the price up
front.
Whether you use an auction, mail order, or a local store, be sure that the test
gear you buy actually works. Have the seller guarantee that the equipment is
in working order by giving you a warranty. You may pay a little bit more for 
it, but if you don’t make sure that it works, and you’re not so good at fixing
broken test gear, you may just be buying an expensive paper weight. If you’re
brand new to electronics, have a more experienced friend or work associate
check out the gear for you. 
Pass up sellers, especially on eBay or other auction sites, who aren’t willing
to guarantee that their products are in working order. Plenty of sellers take
the time to check out their wares and guarantee that the item won’t be dead
on arrival.

372
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

Do
When shopping by mail, be sure to:
 Understand exactly what you’re buying, when the company plans to
deliver it, and how much you’re paying before you send any money.
 Carefully examine your credit card monthly statements for improper
charges.
 Favor those companies that provide a mailing address and a working
phone number for voice contact (not just fax). Sellers without one or 
the other aren’t necessarily crooks, but lack of contact information just
makes it harder to get hold of someone if you run into a problem.
 Be wary of companies that advertise by sending unsolicited spam e-mails.
Also, be sure that the company Web site has an acceptable privacy policy
regarding sharing your contact information.
 Verify shipping and handling charges and service fees before finalizing
your order. These costs can add to the price significantly, especially for
small orders.
 Check out the company before sending them a significant order (what
qualifies as significant is up to you; it may be anything over $500, or it
may be anything over $35). Check for a poor rating with the Better
Business Bureau (or a similar institution for those readers outside the
United States) in the company’s hometown, in the appropriate news-
groups, or in online chat rooms or bulletin boards.
 Add insurance, especially if you’re ordering overseas. As a rule, once 
a package leaves the shipper, it “belongs” to you. If the shipment goes
astray, you’re left holding the bag. If you don’t get insurance, you could
be out money. Many shippers, such as UPS, automatically insure for up
to $100. If your order is worth more than that, be sure to buy extra
insurance.
 Determine added costs for duty, taxes, and shipping when buying 
internationally.
Don’t
Okay, so now you know what to do. Here’s what you should avoid whenever
possible:
 Don’t buy from a source unless you feel very comfortable about sending
money to them.
 Don’t give your credit card number over e-mail or on a Web page order
form unless you know you’re using a secure communications link. When

you’re using a site with security features, a little key lock appears on the
status bar of your browser. This shows you that the communications
between you and the site are encrypted with a code that thieves have a
hard time breaking.
 Don’t use a credit card to pay for goods from a company that you haven’t
yet dealt with if you can just as easily send a check or money order. This
way, you limit the exposure of your credit card accounts to possible
Internet fraud.
 Don’t send money to foreign companies unless you’re positive they’re
safe bets. While you’re checking them out, be sure that they ship to your
country.
New or Surplus?
Surplus is a loaded word. To some, it means junk that just fills up the garage,
like musty canvas tents, or funky fold-up shovels that the U.S. Army used back
in the 1950s. To the true electronics buff, surplus has a totally different mean-
ing: Affordable components that help stretch the electronics-building dollar.
Surplus just means that the original maker or buyer of the goods doesn’t need
it any more. It’s simply excess stock for resale. In the case of electronics, sur-
plus seldom means used, as it might for other surplus components, such as
motors or mechanical devices that have been reconditioned. Except for hard-
to-find components — such as older amateur radio gear — surplus electron-
ics are typically brand new, and someone still actively manufactures much of
this equipment. In this case, surplus simply means extra.
The main benefit of shopping at the surplus electronics retailer is cost: Even
new components are generally lower priced than at the general electronics
retailers. On the downside, you may have a selection limited to whatever
components the store was able to purchase. Don’t expect to find every value
and size of resistor or capacitor, for example.
Remember that when you buy surplus there is no manufacturer’s warranty.
Sometimes that lack of warranty is because the manufacturer is no longer in
business. Though most surplus sellers accept returns if an item is defective
(unless it says something different in their catalog), you should always con-
sider surplus stuff as-is, with no warranty implied or intended (and all that
other lawyer talk).

ormulas take the guesswork out of electronics. Instead of dumping a
bunch of components on the table and plugging them in any which way,
the seasoned electronics experimenter builds new circuits with the help of a
handful of formulas. These formulas help you determine specific values for
things like voltage when you are designing electronic circuits.
You use these same formulas when modifying existing circuits. For example,
you can apply the basic Ohm’s Law formula for direct current (which you can
find in the section titled “Calculating Relationships with Ohm’s Law”) to select
a resistor so that a light emitting diode shines brighter or dimmer, as your
prefer.
This chapter summarizes many of the more commonly-used electronic formu-
las that you encounter in your electronics work. The electronics world has
used quite a few of these formulas for many, many years, but they still work
just fine.
Calculating Relationships 
with Ohm’s Law
Ohm’s Law calculates the relationship between power, voltage, current, and
resistance. Table 18-1 gives you the formulas you use to find these values.

Note that in Table 18-1:
V = voltage (in volts)
I = current (in amps)
P = power (in watts)
R = resistance (in ohms)
Check out this example: To find the power in a circuit consuming 100 volts at
ten amps, multiply volts by amps (100 x 10 = 1000). So, you get the answer of
1,000 watts. You might use this figure to judge how big a fuse you can add to
your circuit without damaging it, or how big an electric bill you’re going to
have at the end of the month.
Here’s another example: To calculate the resistor that you need to handle a
given amount of current through an LED, you use Ohm’s Law like this:
R
I
V
=
Figure 18-1 shows a circuit made up of an LED, a resistor, and a battery (or
other power source). You use this formula to calculate the value of R, the
resistor. 
Here’s what the alphabet soup of V, I, and R means:
 V (also sometimes noted as E): The voltage through the LED. Because
the voltage reduces when it goes through a diode, you have to subtract
this voltage (about 1.2 volts for the typical LED) from the supply voltage.
For example, V = 3.8 volts if the supply voltage is 5 volts and the drop
through the LED is 1.2 volts.
376
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
TEAM LinG - Live, Informative, Non-cost and Genuine !

 I: The current, in amps, that you want flowing through the LED. 20 mA is
a reasonably safe value for almost any LED; a lower value makes for a
dim light, and a higher value — much over 40 or 50 mA — may destroy
the LED. Because you need to express I in amps, 20 mA becomes a frac-
tional number: 0.020 amps.
 R: The resistance needed, in ohms, to limit the current to the LED. 
To continue the example for V and I we’ll plug in some real numbers in place
of the V, I, and R (which you can also see called out in Figure 18-1):

See Chapter 1 and the Ohm’s Law table in the yellow Cheat Sheet in the front

Calculating Resistance
You can calculate the resistance of a single resistor in a circuit simply
enough. But resistance changes when you add resistors in parallel or in
series. For resistors in series, you add the resistance values together. For
resistors in parallel, the result is a little less obvious.
Why bother with calculating resistance of multiple components? There are
several good reasons:
 You can find resistors in only a limited number of common values. Some
circuits call for a specific value that you can create only by inserting two
or more resistors in series or in parallel.

 Resistors aren’t the only components that exhibit resistance. For exam-
ple, the windings of a motor also have a certain resistance. For some
special applications, you need to calculate the combined effect of having
these various resistances in a single circuit.
Calculating resistors in series
The formula for calculating resistors in series is pretty simple — just add up
the resistances. Here’s how it works:

the total resistance.
For example, suppose you have two resistors rated at 1.2k ohms and 2.2k
ohms. Add them together, and the resulting resistance is 3.4k ohms.

in parallel. Here’s the formula you use:

Calculating Capacitance
You can use the formulas in this section to calculate total capacitance in a
circuit. Note that the formulas are basically the inverse of the formulas for
resistors, described earlier in this chapter. And, like resistors, the same logic
applies for why you’d ever want to calculate capacitance of two or more
capacitors together.

Now, why would you ever want to add a bunch of capacitors together this way?
One common reason is to provide a specific capacitance value for which there
is no standard component. You sometimes need to do this with very sensitive
circuits, such as radio receivers.
Calculating Units of Energy
The watt-hour is one of the most practical units of measure of energy; it’s the
ability of a device or circuit to do work. You calculate watt-hours by multiply-
ing the power of the circuit, in watts, by the length of time you have the cir-
cuit on. The formula for calculating watt-hours is
Watt-hours = P × T
In this formula, P stands for power, in watts, and T represents time in hours
that it takes for power to dissipate. To calculate watt-seconds, also known as
the joule, divide watt-hours by 3600.
Calculating RC Time Constants
Electronic circuits often use time constants to provide time delays or stretch
the timing of signals. You most often construct them using a resistor and
capacitor — hence the use of the term RC.
To complete the circuit, you connect the resistor and capacitor, as you can
see in Figure 18-2, to some form of active component, such as an inverter or a
transistor. You can select the values of the resistor and capacitor to produce
a signal that lasts a specific amount of time.

RC circuits work because it takes a certain amount of time for a capacitor to
discharge through a resistor. The larger the value of the resistor and/or
capacitor, the longer it takes for the capacitor to discharge. Circuit designers
use RC networks to produce simple timers and oscillators or to change the
shape of signals.
So how do you calculate the time constant for a resistor-capacitor circuit?
These circuits combine a resistor and a capacitor. Note that the capacitance
value is in farads. Typical capacitor ranges are in microfarads and even
smaller units, so the capacitance value is a fractional number. 
T = RC
In this formula, T represents time (in seconds), R stands for resistance (in
ohms), and C signifies capacitance (in farads).
For example, with a 2000-ohm resistor and a 0.1-uF capacitor, the time con-
stant is 0.002 of a second, or two milliseconds. Table 18-2 shows some exam-
ples so that you can get the zeros right.

Calculating Frequency and Wavelength
The frequency of a signal is directly proportional to its wavelength, as the for-
mulas in the following sections show you. You may find these formulas handy
if you experiment with radio circuits (for example, when cutting a wire to a
specific length to make an antenna). The following formulas express wave-
length in meters and frequency in kilohertz.

Calculating frequency of a signal
Let’s suppose you’re interested in learning electronics so you can gab to folks
all around the world on an amateur radio set. It would be useful for you to
know all about radio frequencies. Radio frequencies, and the wavelength of
the signals carried by those frequencies, work hand in hand. In amateur
radio, you’ll hear people say they’re operating at such-and-such a wave-
length. Here’s how to calculate the frequency of that wavelength. 
,
frequency
wavelength
300 000
=
Wavelength is stated in millimeters, not feet, inches, or a multiple of bunches
of bananas. Frequency is stated in megahertz. 
Calculating wavelength of a signal
You can use the same basic formula to calculate wavelength if you already
know the frequency of the radio signal: 
,
wavelength
frequency
300 000
=
The result is stated in millimeters. The frequency value is stated in megahertz.
Here’s an example. Suppose you’re communicating with beings from another
planet on 50 megahertz (50 million cycles per second). Plugging those num-
bers into the formula, you get:
,
lim
mil
eter
6000
50
300 000
=
^
h
Most folks talk about wavelength in meters, so there’s one final bit of math to
perform. As there are 1000 millimeters to a meter, the result is 6 meters. It
seems you’re talking to E.T. on the six-meter amateur radio band. Cool!
