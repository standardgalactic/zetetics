Abstract
Conway and Radin’s “quaquaversal” tiling of R3 is known to exhibit statistical
rotational symmetry in the inﬁnite volume limit. A ﬁnite patch, however, cannot be
perfectly isotropic, and we compute the rates at which the anisotropy scales with size.
In a sample of volume N, tiles appear in O(N 1/6) distinct orientations. However, the
orientations are not uniformly populated. A small (O(N 1/84)) set of these orientations
account for the majority of the tiles. Furthermore, these orientations are not uniformly
distributed on SO(3). Sample averages of functions on SO(3) seem to approach their
ergodic limits as N −1/336. Since even macroscopic patches of a quaquaversal tiling
maintain noticable anisotropy, a hypothetical physical quasicrystal whose structure
was similar to the quaquaversal tiling could be identiﬁed by anisotropic features of its
electron diﬀraction pattern.

Introduction and Results
This paper concerns statistical properties of Conway and Radin’s [CR] quaquaversal (QQ)
tiling of Euclidean 3-space. A quaquaversal tiling is made by copies of a single wedge-shaped
tile, appearing in an inﬁnite number of distinct orientations. The set of orientations is a
dense subgroup of SO(3), and the orientations are in fact uniformly distributed on SO(3):
Given a smooth function f on SO(3), the average value of f on the orientations of tiles in
a large patch of R3 is close to the integral of f over SO(3) (with respect to Haar measure).
This property, called “statistical rotational symmetry” by Radin [R1], suggests that a large
quasicrystal based on the quaquaversal tiling should appear round, and its physical properties
should be isotropic. We call such a material “asymptotically round”.

In this paper we address the question of how large such a quasicrystal would have to be
to make its roundness manifest. We show that the convergence to rotational symmetry is
polynomial in the sample size, but with an extremely small exponent. Samples with 1024 tiles
have pronounced anisotropy, and even samples with 10100 tiles have noticable anisotropy. In
short, the asymptotic roundness of the quaquaversal tiling, while mathematically correct, is
well beyond the range of any conceivable physics. If a physical material were modeled on
the quaquaversal tiling, it would exhibit considerably more isotropy than a crystal, while
still being considerably less isotropic than a liquid or a glass. These comparisons are dis-
cussed further in Section 5. There is some evidence [R2] that such asymptotically round
quasicrystals may indeed exist in nature.
The slow growth of complexity is not unique to the QQ tiling, but is a typical feature
of 3 dimensional substitution tilings. Two dimensional substitution tilings have even slower
growth, with the number of orientations growing only as the logarithm of the sample size.
We expect that any 3-dimensional substutution tiling that is qualitatively more isotropic
than the QQ tiling would have to have a very complicated substitution rule. In other words,
much of the complexity of the distribution of orientations would have to be built in from the
start, sacriﬁcing the elegant simplicity of the quaquaversal tiling.
The orientations of a randomly chosen tile within the QQ tiling is described by a biased
random walk in a dense subgroup of SO(3). Lubotsky, Phillips and Sarnak [LPS1, LPS2]
considered unbiased random walks on such subgroups in their study of optimal distributions
of points on S2, and some of our methods are related to theirs.
Long time behavior of
unbiased random walks on inﬁnite cyclic subgroups of SO(2) have been studied by Su [S].

It is possible to compare the optimal distribution of elements of SO(3) of [LPS1] with the
distribution of orientations in the quaquaversal tiling as follows. The “operator discrepancy”
considered in [LPS1] is the operator norm of a certain Hecke operator acting on a subspace
of L2(SO(3)) (or L2(S2)). This operator is Hermitian and has discrete spectrum, so its
operator norm is the supremum of the eigenvalues. For an optimal distribution of N points,
with N −1 prime, this supremum was shown to be 2
√
N −1/N, and in particular to decay
as N−1/2. In our case a distribution of orientations of N QQ tiles is obtained by applying a
ﬁxed Hecke operator log8 N times; the log8 N-th power of the largest eigenvalue of this Hecke
operator goes as N−1/336. These eigenvalues are discussed at greater length in Section 4.
The operator discrepancy is a very strict measure of anisotropy. Indeed, all distributions
of points on the circle have operator discrepancy equal to 1. In this paper we also consider
two much weaker measures of spreading. The ﬁrst is just a count of the number of distinct
orientations in SO(3), which turns out to scale as N1/6. The second is the number of distinct
orientations needed to account for half the sample, which scales as N1/84. These measures
are discussed in Section 2 and Section 3, respectively.
The QQ tiling is constructed as follows (see [CR] for details). We begin with a single
right triangular prism,
√
3 units wide, one unit high, and one unit deep, as in Figure 2a.
This prism is divided into eight congruent pieces, each similar to the original. The front four
resulting tiles are shown in Figure 2b, the back four in Figure 2c. We then rescale the entire
pattern by a linear factor of 2, obtaining a cluster of 8 tiles, each congruent to the original.
We can repeat this process of subdivision and rescaling to obtain a cluster of 64 tiles,
of 512 tiles, and so on. We embed each cluster of size 8n within the succeeding cluster of
size 8n+1 (there are 8 ways to do this). The union of all the clusters is then an inﬁnite tiling,
typically covering all of R3.
After a “parent” tile is subdivided, the orientations of the “daughters” are closely related
to that of the parent. We describe the orientation of a tile by a matrix M ∈SO(3), the
columns of which are unit vectors pointing along ﬁxed features of the tile. There exist ﬁxed
matrices g1, . . . , g8 ∈SO(3) such that the orientation of the i-th daughter is Mgi, where the
orientation of the parent is M. After 2 subdivisions, the orientations of the granddaughters
are of the form Mgigj. After n subdivisions the orientations of the descendant tiles are equal
to M times words of length n in the generators {gi}.

We now see why 2-dimensional tilings have extremely slow growth. SO(2) is abelian, so
the number of words of length n in a ﬁxed set of generators has only polynomial growth in
n, while the sample size of a substitution tiling is exponential in the number of subdivisions.
In other words, the number of orientations is logarithmic in the sample size.
SO(3) is
4

nonabelian, however, so the number of distinct words of length n grows exponentially with
n, hence as a power of the sample size. The power, however, need not be large. For the
quaquaversal tiling we will prove
Theorem 1.1 Let n ≥2.
If n = 2k is even, then the number of distinct orientations in the n-th subdivision of a
tile is 24(2k −1) = 24(N1/6 −1), where N = 8n is the total number of tiles.
If n = 2k + 1 is odd, the number of distinct orientations in the n-th subdivision is
34 × 2k −24 = (34/
√
2)N1/6 −24.
By Theorem 1.1, a macroscopic sample of, say, 1024 tiles would appear in over 200,000
diﬀerent orientations. The orientations do not, however, appear with equal frequency, and
they are not evenly distributed in SO(3). In a sample of 827 ≈2.4 × 1024 tiles, a mere 104
orientations account for 69% of the tiles, while in a sample of 8120 ≈2.3 × 10108 tiles, 1000
orientations account for slightly over half the tiles. The asymptotic behavior is given by:
Theorem 1.2 Let ρ > 1/28, and let Fα(n) be the number of distinct orientations needed to
account for a fraction α of the 8n tiles in the n-th subdivision. For any ﬁxed α,
lim
n→∞2−ρnFα(n)
=
0.
That is, 2−n/28Fα(n) is asymptotically smaller than any exponential in n (i.e. any power
of the volume), so we speak of Fα(n) as growing essentially as 2n/28, or as the 84th root of
the volume.
Finally, we consider the rate at which the orientations approach a uniform distribution
on SO(3). Let f(M) be a real-valued function of M ∈SO(3), and let fn(M) be the average
value of f on the 8n orientations of the n-th order descendants of a tile of orientation M.
If f is continuous, then fn(M) must converge to
R
SO(3) fdµ for every M, where dµ is Haar
measure on SO(3). However, this convergence may be quite slow:
Theorem 1.3 There exists a smooth function f : SO(3) →R and a point M ∈SO(3) such
that |fn(M) −
R
SO(3) fdµ| > (0.9938)n for every n.
We believe this result to be close to sharp:
Conjecture 1.4 For any continuous function f : SO(3) →R and any point M ∈SO(3),
there exists a constant C such that |fn(M) −
R
SO(3) fdµ| < C2−n/112 ≈C(0.9938303)n for
every n.
In other words, it appears that functions do converge to their average values exponen-
tially in the volume, with the exponents bounded away from 0, but there are exponents about
5

as small as 1/336. As in all linear systems of exponential decay, the long-time behavior is
dominated by the smallest exponents, so we expect the anisotropy of a generic function on
SO(3) to decay roughly as N−1/336 for suﬃciently large N.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we examine the set of orientations that
can arise from successive subdivision of a single tile. This set turns out to be a subgroup,
denoted G(6, 4), of SO(3). The analysis of this section is a special case of some general
results of [RS1]. We establish a canonical form for an element of G(6, 4) as a word in two
generators, and provide an explicit list of the orientations in the n-th subdivision, thereby
proving Theorem 1.1. We also develop a measure, called “size”, of the complexity of an
element of G(6, 4).
In Section 3 we consider the populations of the various orientations of the descendants
of a given tile as a function of n, the number of subdivisions. We show that the “size”
of the orientation of a randomly chosen tile is described by a biased random walk (on the
non-negative integers) with a reﬂecting barrier. Although the maximum size is n/2, the
distribution of sizes is approximately Gaussian with mean n/28 + O(1). Since there are
O(2n/28) words of size n/28 or less, Theorem 1.2 follows.
Theorem 1.2 is an asymptotic statement.
To obtain results for speciﬁc values of n
we numerically implement the random walk for n up to 200. This establishes the claims
previously made about samples of size 827 and 8120.
In Section 4, we consider the rate at which the distribution of orientations approaches
uniformity on SO(3). There is a linear map L on L2(SO(3)) such that fn = Lnf. L is similar
to the Hecke operators considered in [LPS1, LPS2], except that those Hecke operators were
Hermitian, while L is not. Nonetheless, the spectrum of L appears to be entirely real. If
fn is to approach a limiting function exponentially, the base of the exponent (for generic f)
is the largest eigenvalue of L that is less than 1. The operator L is the direct sum of ﬁnite
dimensional blocks, each block corresponding to an irreducible representation of SO(3). By
numerically diagonalizing blocks corresponding to the ﬁrst 300 representations (blocks with
total dimension over 36,000,000), we ﬁnd a large number of eigenvalues over 0.993, with the
largest being approximately 0.99381, and conjecture that the eigenvalues are bounded above
by 2−1/112 ≈0.9938303.

The group G(6, 4)
Let Rθ
x denote a rotation about the x axis by an angle θ. The group generated by R2π/p
x
and
R2π/q
y
is denoted G(p, q). (For a discussion of G(p, q) for general p and q, and for further
generalizations, see [RS1, RS2].) The set of orientations in the QQ tiling is precisely G(6, 4),
generated by S := Rπ/2
y
and T := Rπ/3
x . Indeed, the orientations g1, . . . , g8 of the eight
daughters of a tile in standard position all are words in S and T, and it is not hard to get
S and T themselves as products of the gi’s. To understand these orientations, therefore, we
must understand G(6, 4).

A word α in S and T is said to be in canonical form if
α
=
Sa0T b0,
(2.1)
with a0 ∈{0, 1, 2, 3} and b0 ∈{0, 3}, or if
α
=
WST b1ST b2 · · · ST bnE,
(2.2)
with n ≥1, with W of the form (2.1), with each bi = 2 or 4, and with E = 1 or S. We shall
soon see that each element of G(6, 4) can be expressed by a unique canonical form. The size
of an element of G(6, 4) with canonical form (2.2) is deﬁned to be n. (Elements of the form
(2.1) have size zero).
To understand the group G(6, 4), we represent S and T by explicit 3 × 3 matrices.
Relative to the standard basis {e1, e2, e3} of R3, the matrices of S and T are
S =


0

(2.3)
The factors of
√
3 are inconvenient to work with. We eliminate them by working in the basis
{e1,
√
3e2, e3}, relative to which the matrices of S and T are:
S =

Theorem 2.6 Every element g ∈G(6, 4) can be expressed in canonical form, and the canon-
ical form is unique. If g has size n, then, in the representation (2.4), 2ng is an integer
matrix with at least one odd matrix element. There exist exactly 8 group elements of size 0
and 16 × 2n elements of size n > 0.
Proof:
Note that 2ST 2 and 2ST 4 are matrices with integer entries of the form


even
odd
odd
even
odd
odd
even
even
even

,
(2.7)
and that the product of two or more matrices of the form given in (2.7) is also of the form
given in (2.7). If g can be expressed in canonical form (2.7), then
2ng
=
W(2ST b1)(2ST b2) · · ·(2ST bn)E
=
W(form 2.7)(form 2.7) · · · (form 2.7)E
=
W(form 2.7)E.
(2.8)

Since S is a permutation matrix (up to sign), and T 3 is the identity (up to sign), 2ng is
an integer matrix with four odd matrix elements and ﬁve even matrix elements.
If g is
of canonical form (2.1), then 2ng = 20g = g is an integer matrix with three odd matrix
elements. This proves the second statement of the theorem, and also shows that the identity
can be put in canonical form in only one way, namely 1 = S0T 0.
To see that every element of G(6, 4) can be put in canonical form, begin with an arbitrary
word
α
=
Sa1T b1 · · · SanT bn
(2.9)
in S and T. If any of the ai’s is even, or any of the bi’s is a multiple of 3, we can use the
relations
ST 3
=
T 3S−1
(2.10)
and
S2T
=
T −1S2
(2.11)
to shorten the word. So we can assume that all the ai’s (except possibly a1) are odd, and
that none of the bi’s (except possibly b1) are multiples of 3. We then use (2.10) to extract
powers of T 3 and move them leftwards, changing T 1 to T 4 and changing T 5 to T 2. We
then use (2.11) to extract powers of S2 and move them leftwards, changing S3 to S. In the
process, we may change some T 2’s to T 4’s and vice-versa, but that does not aﬀect the form
(2.2). Finally, if b1 is not divisible by 3, we use (2.10) to rewrite Sa1T b1 as Sa0T 3b0ST b′
1 with
b′
1 = 2 or 4.
To see that a canonical form is unique, suppose g and g′ are distinct canonical forms for
the same group element. Using the relations (2.10) and (2.11), we could then shorten the
word g′g−1 to a nontrivial word in canonical form, which would have to represent the identity.
But we have already seen that there are no nontrivial canonical forms for the identity.
Since group elements are in 1-1 correspondence with canonical forms, we can count
group elements of any given size. There are 8 choices for W, 2 choices for each bi, and 2
choices for E, for a total of 16×2n elements of size n > 0. For size 0 there are only 8 choices,
4 for a0 and 2 for b0.
We now have the machinery to understand the orientations of tiles in the n-fold subdi-
vision of a single quaquaversal tile. In a single subdivision, the daughters are described by
group elements {g1, . . . , g8} with

(2.12)
Note that T = g7g6, so the semigroup generated by the gi’s is precisely the group
generated by S and T. Also note that only two of the gi’s, namely g7 and g8, have size 1,
while the rest have size zero. Since g2
7, g2
8, g7g8 and g8g7 all have size 1 or less, the orientations
in the 2nd subdivision have size at most 1 and the orientations in the 2k-th subdivision have
size at most k. This shows that the number of possible orientations in the n-th subdivision
is bounded by a constant multiple of 2n/2.
However, we can be more precise. The following theorem implies Theorem 1.1:
Theorem 2.13 The orientations appearing in subdivisions of a single tile (of standard ori-
entation) are as follows. Let Pm be the set of words of length m in the two generators ST 2
and ST 4. For k > 0, the orientations of the 2k-th subdivision are:
1. T bPmSa, with no restriction on a or b, and with m ranging from 0 to k −2,
2. T bPk−1Sa, with b = 0, 2, 3, or 5 and a arbitrary,
3. T bPk−1Sa with b = 1 or 4 and a = 0 or 2,
4. ST 2Pk−1Sa, with a = 0 or 2, and
5. T 3(ST 4)Pk−1Sa, with a = 0 or 2.
For k > 0, the orientations in the (2k + 1)st subdivision are
1. T bPmSa, with no restriction on a or b and m ranging from 0 to k −1,
2. T bPkSa , with b = 0, 2, 3 or 5 and a = 0 or 2,
3. ST 2Pk−1Sa, with a = 1 or 3, and
4. T 3ST 4Pk−1Sa, with a = 1 or 3.
Proof:
It is not hard to see that, in each case, the sets are disjoint and their cardinalities
add up to the total indicated in Theorem 1.1. To complete the proof we must check i) that
the claimed orientations for 2 subdivisions are correct, ii) that the claimed orientations for
9

2k subdivisions times the generators g1, . . . , g8 give precisely the claimed orientations for
2k + 1 subdivisions, and iii) that the claimed orientations for 2k + 1 subdivisions times the
generators g1, . . . , g8 give precisely the claimed orientations for 2k +2 subdivisions. We leave
this straightforward (but quite tedious) computation as an exercise for the highly motivated
reader.

Population dynamics
In Section 2, we counted the number of distinct orientations of tiles in the n-th subdivision
of a QQ tile, which equals the number of algebraically distinct words of length n in the
generators g1, . . . g8. In this section we consider the distribution of tiles among the various
orientations. Equivalently, we count repetitions in the words of length n in the gi’s.
We do this by modeling the subdivision process as a random walk on G(6, 4). If at some
stage we are at the group element M, then at the next stage we can go to Mg1, Mg2, . . . , Mg8,
each with probability 1/8. The distribution of orientations in the n-th subdivision of a tile
(with standard orientation) is precisely the n-th iterate of this random walk, starting at the
origin. The following theorem implies Theorem 1.2.
Theorem 3.1 Consider the random walk starting at the origin, and let P(k, n) be the prob-
ability that the n-th iteration yields a group element of size k or greater. For any ρ > 1/28,
limn→∞P(nρ, n) = 0.
Proof:
We divide G(6, 4) into sets according to size and the pattern at the end of the canonical
form. The random walk on G(6, 4) then induces a random walk on the space of sets, and
we show that the bias in this random walk causes the average size to increase by 1/28 each
turn. The result then follows from the central limit theorem.
Let R(k, ST 2) be the set of group elements of size k whose canonical forms end with
ST 2. R(k, ST 4), R(k, T 2S), and R(k, T 4S) are deﬁned similarly. R(0) is the set of elements
of size 0.
If M ∈R(k, ST 2), then Mg1, Mg4 and Mg5 are equal to M, and so are in R(k, ST 2).
Mg2 is in R(k, T 4S), Mg3 is in R(k, T 2S), and Mg6 is in R(k, ST 4).
Mg7 may be in
R(k −1, T 2S) or R(k −1, T 4S), depending on whether M ends with ST 2ST 2 or ST 4ST 2.
However, if Mg7 ∈R(k −1, T 2S), then Mg8 ∈R(k −1, T 4S), and vice-versa. In either
case, starting in R(k, ST 2), there is a 3/8 probability of staying in R(k, ST 2) and a 1/8
probabilty for each of the destinations R(k, ST 4), R(k, T 2S), R(k, T 4S), R(k −1, T 2S) and
R(k −1, T 4S).
This analysis, and the corresponding analysis for R(k, ST 4), R(k, T 2S) and R(k, T 4S),
is summarized in the diagram

Since the long-time behaviors of positively biased random walks are independent of the
boundary conditions at k = 0, the reﬂecting barrier at k = 0 does not aﬀect the theorem. To
establish the theorem, we need only calculate the bias in the random walk away from k = 0
and show it equals 1/28.
We ﬁrst compute the distribution of ST 2, ST 4, T 2S and T 4S endings. Summing over
k, we ﬁnd the transition matrix for the four classes of group elements is

That is, asymptotically 4/14 of the tiles have orientations whose canonical forms end with
ST 2, 4/14 end with ST 4, 3/14 end with T 2S and 3/14 end with T 4S.
On each iteration, an ST 2 state has a 2/8 chance of decreasing k (and none of increasing),
ST 4 states have no chance of either increasing or decreasing k, while T 2S and T 4S states
each have a 2/8 chance of increasing k and no chance of decreasing. Weighing these chances
11

by the (4/14, 4/14, 3/14, 3/14) limiting distribution, we see that at each step in the random
walk there is a 3/28 chance of increasing k and a 2/28 chance of decreasing k, for a net bias
of 1/28.
Theorem 3.1 is an asymptotic result that does not indicate have many iterations are
needed to reach the asymptotic regime. Indeed, the bias in the random walk is so small
that, for moderate numbers of iterations, one would expect diﬀusion and the reﬂecting
barrier at k = 0 to be quite signiﬁcant. To measure this transient behavior we rely on the
following numerical implementation, in MATLAB, of the biased random walk. Here zz(n)
is the fraction of orientations of size zero in the n-th generation, st2(k,n) (resp. st4(k,n),
t2s(k,n), t4s(k,n)) is the fraction in R(ST 2, k) (resp. R(ST 4, k), R(T 2S, k), R(T 4S, k))
in the n-th generation, and tot(k+1,n) is the fraction of size k in the n-th generation.

Note that by Theorem 2.6 there are exactly 8 orientations of size zero, 40 of size at most 1,
104 of size at most 2, 232 of size at most 3, 488 of size at most 4, 1000 of size at most 5,
2024 of size at most 6, 4072 of size at most 7 and 8168 of size at most 8. Thus for n = 27,
just 104 orientations account for the majority of the tiles, while for n = 120, a mere 1000
orientations account for the majority of the tiles.
Table 1 shows the distribution of sizes for three samples, a microscopic sample with
85 = 32768 tiles, a macroscopic sample with 827 ≈2.42 × 1024 tiles (about 4 moles), and an
impossibly large sample of 8120 ≈2.35 ×10108 tiles. Table 2 shows similar results for n = 10,
20, 30, 40 and 50.

Approach to the ergodic limit

n-fold subdivision of a tile of orientation M. Equivalently,

As n →∞, fn(g) approaches the constant limit
R
SO(3) fdµ, where dµ is Haar measure. The
question is how fast the (ergodic) limit is approached.
One approach to the problem is to consider the linear operator L : L2(SO(3)) →
L2(SO(3)) deﬁned by
Lf(M)

(4.3)
Of course, the constant function is an eigenfunction of L with eigenvalue 1. The rate at
which fn approaches a constant function is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue of
L.
The operator L is quite similar to the Hecke operators considered in [LPS1, LPS2],
except that the set {gi} is not balanced, as the inverses of g3 and g8 are not in the set. As a

result, L is not a self-adjoint operator on L2(SO(3)), not even with a weighted measure, and
we know of no a priori reason why the eigenvalues of L need be real. However, the numerical
experiments described below indicate that the eigenvalues of L are indeed real. We do not
understand the reason for this.
The natural (left and right) actions of SO(3) on L2(SO(3)), namely (l, r) : f(g) →
f(lgr), decomposes L2(SO(3)) into irreducible representations of SO(3). Since L is a lin-
ear combination of right-translations, it acts separately on each representation. Thus the
inﬁnite-dimensional job of diagonalizing L on all of L2 breaks down into a sequence of
ﬁnite-dimensional problems, namely diagonalizing L on each irreducible representation that
appears in the decomposition of L2.
The irreducible representations of SO(3) are standard. The spin-ℓrepresentation, of
dimension 2ℓ+ 1, appears 2ℓ+ 1 times in the decomposition of L2.
In particular, each
representation appears at least once. For each representation Rℓ, we must diagonalize the
(2ℓ+ 1) × (2ℓ+ 1) matrix
Lℓ
=
1
8 [Rℓ(g1) + · · · + Rℓ(g8)] .
(4.4)
We have done this, using MATLAB, for ℓup to 300, thereby diagonalizing L on a
subspace of L2(SO(3)) of total dimension greater than 36,000,000.
There are numerous
eigenvalues over 0.993, but none over 0.994; the largest known eigenvalue is λ ≈0.99381,
appearing in the ℓ= 258 representation.
This proves Theorem 1.4, and suggests there
is an upper bound to the eigenvalues slightly above 0.99381.
Since powers of 2 appear
repeatedly in the analysis, and since Theorem 1.2 suggests a time scale of 28 subdivisions,
2−1/(4×28) ≈0.9938303 is a fairly natural guess for that upper bound.
Table 3 lists the largest eigenvalue for each of the ﬁrst 20 representations. Table 4 lists
the “record” eigenvalues, those larger than any eigenvalue corresponding to smaller ℓ. The
MATLAB program for ﬁnding the largest eigenvalues from the ﬁrst Lmax representations is

Conclusions and Speculations
Much of the interest in tilings stems from the fact that crystals and quasicrystals are modeled
by tilings in which the tiles appear in only a ﬁnite number of orientations. Is there a form of
matter that is modeled on aperiodic tilings with statistical rotational symmetry, in particular
on a substitution tiling such as the quaquaversal? If so, how would such a form of matter
be recognized?
This paper provides the tools needed to recognize such a substance. We have computed
the distribution of orientations in a sample of size N = 8n of the QQ tiling. The exact same
calculation gives the distribution of orientations of 8-tile clusters in a sample of size 8n+1, of
64-tile clusters in a sample of size 8n+2, and so on. In particular, the angular distribution of
the relative positions of nearby tiles, and therefore the angular distribution of the electron
diﬀraction pattern, are governed by the results of this paper.
To detect an asymptotically round quasicrystal, one must look at the diﬀraction pattern
16

of a ﬁnite sample and decompose it into spherical harmonics. As long as the wavelengths
in question are much shorter than the size of the sample, the angular distribution of the
diﬀraction pattern will scale with sample size in a manner determined by the eigenvalues. If
a spherical harmonic is an eigenvector of L with eigenvalue λ, then the diﬀraction pattern
of a sample of size 8N will exhibit this harmonic a factor of λ less than that of a sample of
size N.
As a result, some harmonics will be essentially absent from the diﬀraction pattern of a
macroscopic sample; those correspond to eigenfunctions of L with λn ≪1. Other modes,
with 1−λ comparable to or less than 1/n, will appear. A macroscopic (say, N = 827) sample
of the QQ tiling, for example, would have a diﬀraction pattern with a small but probably
detectable ℓ= 4 component, and with essentially undamped ℓ= 6, ℓ= 8 and ℓ= 10
components. There are relatively few eigenfunctions with such large eigenvalues (even for
ℓ= 8, all but two of the 17 eigenvalues are less than 0.65), so the diﬀraction pattern will
be dominated by the ℓ= 0 (isotropic) component, with some corrections from harmonics
with ℓ= 6, 8, 10, etc. This result is much more isotropic than that of a crystal or ordinary
quasicrystal (for which many harmonics are completely undamped, and the spectrum consists
of discrete points), while much less isotropic than that of an amorphous substance such as a
glass, for which only the isotropic ℓ= 0 term is observable.
The radial dependence of the diﬀraction pattern also carries important information. As
with other quasicrystals, and unlike amorphous media, one expects asymptotically round
quasicrystals to have radially self-similar diﬀraction patterns. In combination, a self-similar
radial pattern combined with a mildly anisotropic angular pattern should indicate an asymp-
totically round quasicrystal.
