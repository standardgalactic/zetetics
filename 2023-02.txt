The physics of signal propagation in a collection of organisms that communicate with each other
both enables and limits how active excitations at the individual level reach, recruit and lead to
collective patterning. Inspired by the patterns in a planar swarm of bees that release pheromones,
and use fanning ﬂows to recruit additional bees, we develop a theoretical framework for patterning
via active ﬂow-based recruitment. Our model generalizes the well-known Patlak-Keller-Segel model
of diﬀusion-dominated aggregation and leads to more complex phase space of patterns spanned by
two dimensionless parameters that measure the scaled stimulus/activity and the scaled chemotactic
response. Together these determine the eﬃcacy of signal communication that leads to a variety of
migration and aggregation patterns consistent with observations.
In groups of individual agents in both natural and ar-
tiﬁcial settings, communication is central to achieving a
coordinated collective response. Indeed, the survival of
the colony pivots around robust communication in the
context of foraging [1–3], protection against invasion by
an intruder [4, 5], brood care in eusocial clusters [6, 7] and
other tasks inside the nest [8, 9]. The eﬃcacy of commu-
nication is limited by the dynamics of signal propagation
among agents through the environment [10–13]. Over the
last century, stigmergy has emerged as one of the most
well studied mechanisms to achieve robust communica-
tion [14–16]: here animals modify the environment by
using localized signals that serve as recruitment cues in
the context of functional behavior. However, stigmergy
is just one way of environmentally modulated commu-
nication. Organisms use slow diﬀusive signals
[17–19]
that underlie the principle of quorum sensing [20], passive
and active ﬂuid ﬂows [21–23], and even elastic deforma-
tions [24] to transmit information via physical communi-
cation channels. Indeed, social insects such as honey bees
(e.g.
the species apis mellifera) use all these diﬀerent
modes of communication and actively modify their local
mechanical, thermal and hydrodynamic environment to
transmit information and coordinate their activities and
functions.
A particularly striking example of active, long-range
and fast communication is seen in bees that settle on a
substrate and ﬂap their wings to generate a ﬂuid ﬂow
parallel to their body axis while releasing pheromones
into it [25–29]. In Fig. 1(a) and SI Fig. S1, we show how
ﬂuid ﬂow mediated communication leads to a character-
istic triangular swarm shape that migrates towards the
source of pheromones [25]. These patterns arise on time
scales of minutes spontaneously from a disordered state
and can extend to include hundreds of bees.
To understand the nature and eﬃcacy of ﬂow-mediated
patterning, we need to couple the three observable

spatiotemporal ﬁelds that are shown schematically in
Fig. 1(b):
the bee density ϱ(x||, t) (and orientation
ˆp(x||, t) denotes head forward) as a function of location
on the plane z = 0 denoted by x|| = (x, y) and time,
the scalar pheromone concentration ﬁeld c(x, t) and the
active ﬂuid ﬂow generated by the bees uf(x, t).
Bees
disperse pheromones from their Nasonov glands into the
active ﬂow that they generate by fanning.
This leads
to the active recruitment of bees from the environment
and their migration which then leads to an enhanced
rate of pheromone dispersal. The positive feedback leads
to spatio-temporal patterns of growing, self-focusing and
migrating swarms. While there are many qualitative ob-
servations of the process [28, 30], the quantitative collec-
tive dynamics of recruitment, agent-environment feed-
back, and inter-agent interaction mediated by volatile
pheromones is largely unexplored. Here, we develop a
minimal model for ﬂuid ﬂow mediated communication
and recruitment which we dub rheomergy.
As we will
see, our model broadens the scope of the classical Patlak-
Keller-Segel (PKS) model [17–19] for chemotaxis by ac-
counting for dynamics of active ﬂuid ﬂow and the behav-
ioral response of the agents to ﬂow-mediated communica-
tion leading to a more complex phase space of patterns.
Continuum model of rheomergy: The evolution equations
for the agent density ϱ(x||, t), the pheromone ﬁeld c(x, t)
and the ﬂuid ﬂow generated by the agents, uf(x, t) can
be written as,
∂tϱ + ∇|| · (uaϱ) = Da∇2

Eqs. 1-5: agent density ϱ(x||, t) which is conﬁned to a 2D
surface x|| = (x, y) generates a pheromone ﬁeld of concentra-
tion c(x, t) that gets fanned through the environment by the
actively generated bee velocity ﬁeld uf(x, t). The advected
pheromone causes either additional agents (bees) to be re-
cruitment or causes them to migrate. (c) Phase diagram of
rheomergy represented using two non-dimensional ratios: Ac-
tive Peclet number which is the ratio of pheromone decay rate
to active ﬂuid shear rate, Rc/Vc and recruitment strength to
chemotaxis strength, Rϱ/Vϱ (see text for details). Four phases
characterizing the collective behavior of agents exist depend-
ing on the region in phase-space: polarized recruitment, mi-
gration, local aggregation and isotropic recruitment (similar
to that seen in the Patlak-Keller-Segel model).
ing to a nominal ambient density; here the chemotactic
velocity deﬁned by Eq. 2 is ua(x||, t) with a chemotac-
tic gain χ and ∇|| denotes in-plane gradients, deﬁned
along the plane z = 0, the ﬁrst term on the right side
captures diﬀusion of agents with a diﬀusivity Da, the
second term denotes relaxation to a nominal density ϱo
with δϱ = (ϱo −ϱ) and kb denotes the relaxation rate,
and the last term characterizes recruitment with αp being
the sensitivity to pheromone above a threshold c∗where
δc = (c −c∗), and Θ(•) is the Heaviside function. The
agent density is limited to a maximum ϱmax through the
term (1 −ϱ/ϱmax). Equation 3 characterizes the dynam-
ics of the pheromone that is advected by the active ﬂow
velocity uf generated by the swarm, diﬀuses into the en-
vironment with a diﬀusivity Dp, is produced by bees at
a rate k+ and decays at a rate k−. Equations 4-5 follow
from the dynamics of (incompressible) ﬂow of ﬂuid with
viscosity ν and density ρf, and an eﬀective friction factor
νs associated with ﬂuid motion relative to the substrate.
Since this ﬂow is actively generated by bees, we model
this using a shear rate at the boundary proportional to
their local density: ∂zuf(z = 0) = βϱˆp, where ˆp is the
local polarity of the bees which generates a ﬂow velocity
opposite to their orientation and parallel to the surface
(see Fig. 1(a) and [29]), with β > 0. Equations 1-5 form
a closed system for the variables {ϱ, c, uf, p} which are
complete when we specify initial and boundary condi-
tions for all the ﬁelds (see SI sec. III for details).
We make Eqs. 1-5 dimensionless using the natural
length-scale ζ−1 = (ν/νs)1/2 and time-scale k−1
b
for
Eq. 1, and k−1
−
for Eq. 3 (see SI tab. I for other
length and time-scales in the system), the homogeneous
relaxation density ϱo as the density-scale, the maxi-
mum pheromone concentration co as the concentration-
scale (see SI sec. I for details), resulting in 7 non-
dimensional numbers associated with scaled magnitudes
of chemotactic strength, Vϱ = (χcoζ2)/kb; agent dif-
fusivity, Dϱ = (Daζ2/kb); recruitment strength, Rϱ =
αpco/(kbϱo); shear, Vc = (βϱo/k−); pheromone de-
cay, Rc = k+ϱo/(k−co); pheromone diﬀusivity, Dc =
(Dpζ2/k−); friction factor, Du = νs/(βϱo). This allows
us to rewrite the variables after scaling as: ˜ϱ →ϱ/ϱo, ˜c →
c/co, ˜uf →uf(ζ/βϱo), ˜p →p ζ2/(βϱo)2ρf.
In the case of active ﬂow-driven communication, rel-
evant for social insects, we assume that the agents op-
erate in the interesting neighborhood of the threshold
pheromone concentration c ∼c∗, we therefore replace
Θ(δc) →Rϱδc.
In the limit of rapid equilibration of
the pheromone concentration and a rapid relaxation to
steady velocity relative to agent recruitment rates and
pheromone decay rates relevant for social insects, we as-
sume that ∂tc ≈0 and ∂tuf ≈0, so that Eqs. 1-5 in
scaled units reduce to
∂tϱ + Vϱ∇|| · (ϱ∇||c) = Dϱ∇2
||ϱ + (1 −ϱ/ϱmax)[(1 −ϱ)
+ Rϱδc],

Dc∇2c + Vc∇· (ufc) = Rcϱ −c,
(7)
Du(∇2uf −uf) = ∇p
(8)
∇· uf = 0.
(9)
When the diﬀusion of pheromone dominates over advec-
tion i.e. Dc ∼Rc ≫1, Vc and in the absence of recruit-
ment and relaxation (αp, kb = 0) or when the agent den-
sity has reached the maximum value (ϱ = ϱmax), Eqs. 6-7
reduce to the PKS equations (see SI sec. IV B for de-
tails). In this article, however, we are interested in the
limit relevant for social insects where the dynamics of
the agents is governed primarily by chemotaxis and re-
cruitment, i.e. Dϱ ≪Vϱ ∼Rϱ and that the pheromone
rapidly equilibrates due to advection, i.e. Dc ≪Vc ∼Rc.
From now on, we will therefore ignore the eﬀects of agent
and pheromone diﬀusivity.
We explore the diﬀerent limits of the phase-space

FIG. 2. Dynamics of agent density, ϱ(x, t) and pheromone
concentration, c(x, t) in the (a) ﬂow (and recruitment) domi-
nated regime (Ia in the text) where agents polarize in response
to autogenic ﬂow and recruitment, leading to an increase in
the agent density (for Vc = 0.5, Rc = 0.5, Vϱ = 0.0, Rϱ =
300.0). The plots on the right show the self-similar evolution
of agent density and the pheromone concentration, consistent
with a the collapse of the diﬀerent curves when scaled by xt, x

chemotaxis) dominated regime phase (Ib in the text) where
the agents migrate upstream in the direction of ﬂow through

obtained by numerically solving Eqs. 10, 11 (see SI sec. V for
details).
by Vϱ, Rϱ) to understand the diﬀerent modes of collective
patterning determined by our model.
There are four
diﬀerent regimes characterized by relative magnitudes
of Rϱ, Vϱ and Rc, Vc (see Fig. 1(c)) which we address
in a 1-dimensional setting before turning brieﬂy to the
2-dimensional case (see SI sec. IV for details).
(I) Flow dominated regimes (Vc, Rc ≫1) : In the ﬂow-
dominated regime, we explore the collective behavior of
the agents as we vary Rϱ/Vϱ - see Fig. 1(c). Assuming
that the colony is uniformly active and generating ﬂow
everywhere, i.e.
ϱ = 1, the velocity ﬁeld is given by
the solution of Eqs. 8, 9 subject to the shear bound-
ary condition at the wall:
∂z(uf · ˆx||)(z = 0) = 1,
which yields a polarized ﬂow ﬁeld in the in-plane direc-
tion u||(z) ≡uf · ˆx|| = −exp(−z). Then the pheromone
concentration (obtained by substituting the above result
in Eq. 7) yields c(x) = Rc[1 −exp (x/Vc)]. This inho-
mogeneous pheromone concentration proﬁle driven by a
homogeneous agent density ϱ = 1 causes the agents to
migrate when the chemotactic response Vϱ > 0 (see from
Eq. 6), indicating the unstable nature of this density pro-
ﬁle.
Substituting the exponential ﬂow proﬁle into Eq. 7 for
the pheromone dynamics (see SI sec. III for details) in the
limit of advection-dominated pheromone transport leads
to the shear becoming proportional to agent density so
that ∂zu|| ∼1, and Eqs. 6-8 simplify to the coupled sys-
tem for the agent density and the pheromone concentra-
tion,
∂tϱ + Vϱ∂x(ϱ∂xc) = (1 −ϱ/ϱmax)[(1 −ϱ) + Rϱc],
(10)
−Vc∂x(ϱc) = Rcϱ −c.
(11)
To explore the behavior of the collective agent dynamics
in the diﬀerent limits of phase-space we solve Eqs. 10, 11
(see SI sec. V for details).
(Ia) Recruitment dominated regime (Rϱ ≫1, Vϱ ≪1):
In Fig. 2(a) we see that an initially localized gaussian
proﬁle of the agent density ϱ(x, 0) centered around x = 0
grows and spreads along the direction of pheromone ad-
vection due to ﬂow-driven agent recruitment. Eventually,
the agent density saturates to maximal packing density
ϱ = ϱmax. Simultaneously, the pheromone concentration
c(x, t) increases with increasing recruitment and is also
advected by ﬂow (see Fig. 2(a)). To understand the scal-
ing behavior of the spatio-temporal proﬁles of the agent
and pheromone density in the growth phase, we note that
when the pheromone is produced by agents and trans-
ported by the active ﬂow with decay being insigniﬁcant,
Eq. 11 reduces to −Vc∂x(ϱc) ∼Rcϱ. Furthermore, when
the eﬀects of chemotaxis are small (i.e. Vϱ →0), the
agent density scales as ϱ ∼xt while the concentration of
the pheromone scales as c ∼x (see SI sec. IV A for a
detailed analysis). Normalizing ϱ(x, t) and c(x, t) using
this scaling causes the curves to collapse on top of each
other (see rightmost ﬁgures in Fig. 2(a)).
(Ib) Chemotaxis dominated regime (Vϱ ≫1, Rϱ ≪1):
In Fig. 2(b) we see that an initially localized agent
density collectively migrates up the pheromone gradi-
ent.
Simultaneously the concentration of pheromone
decreases in magnitude and migrates with the agents.
To understand these observations we note that in
the
ﬂow-dominated
regime,
Eq.
11
implies
that
−Vc∂x(ϱc) ∼Rcϱ, which when substituted into Eq. 10
yields:
∂tϱ −(VϱRc/Vc)∂xϱ = Vϱ∂x(c∂xϱ).
We see
that agents migrate with a speed (VϱRc/Vc) and diﬀuse
inhomogeneously due to the pheromone concentration
that acts as a spatially varying diﬀusivity.
Here the
emergence of collectively polarized migration even in the
absence of recruitment (Vϱ ≫1, Rϱ →0) is due to au-
tonomous ﬂuid ﬂow coupled with pheromone production.

FIG. 3.
Polarized recruitment of active agents and cor-
responding pheromone concentration in two-dimensions ob-
tained by solving Eqs. 6, 11 and plotted at t = 1.5. Agent
density along x = 0 is set to ϱ(0, y, t) = exp(−y2/2w2) with
w = 2 and these agents generate ﬂow u|| along positive x-
axis that results in recruitment of other agents. The triangu-
lar shape is a consequence of chemotaxis driven by gradients
in pheromone along y-axis. We choose Neumann boundary
condition for ϱ(x, y, t), c(x, y, t) along other boundaries. The
non-dimensional numbers are chosen to be Vc = 0.5, Rc =
0.5, Vϱ = 25.0, Rϱ = 300.0 (see SI sec. V for further details).
(II) Pheromone decay dominated regimes (Vc ≪Rc ∼1):
In the pheromone dominated regime, we explore the col-
lective behavior of the agents as we vary Rc/Vc - see
Fig. 1(c).
In the limit of a homogeneous agent den-
sity ϱ = 1, when the eﬀects of decay dominate (Rc ≳
1, Vc →0), Eq. 11 yields css = Rc. Perturbing about
this steady state (ϱss = 1, css = Rc) using the ansatz
{ϱ(x, t) −ϱss, c(x, t) −css} = {ˆϱ(q), ˆc(q)} exp(iqx + Ωt)
where Ω(q) is the frequency of oscillation and q the scalar
wavenumber, ˆϱ(q), ˆc(q) are the complex amplitudes of
agent density and pheromone concentration and substi-
tuting into Eqs. 6, 7 yields the dispersion relation (de-
rived in SI sec. II),
Ω(q) = 1

,
(12)
where we have λ = (k−/kb) and we use k−1
b
as the
time-scale to non-dimensionalize the frequency.
When
ℜ(Ω(q)) > 0 the agent density becomes unstable; for long
wavelengths (q →0) Eq. 12 becomes Ω(q) ≈[−(1 + λ) +
p
(λ −1)2 + 4λRcRϱ]/2 and we see that the dynamics is
governed by competition between recruitment sensitiv-
ity (from Rϱ) and pheromone decay (from Rc). When
Rϱ ≫1 corresponding to large recruitment sensitivity
this triggers long wavelength perhaps suggestive of such
a mechanism at play when the colony in under threat
from an intruder. For smaller wavelengths (q ≫1) the
instability is due to competition between pheromone de-
cay (contributions from Rc) and chemotaxis (from Vϱ),
as Ω(q) ≈2
p
λRcVϱq.
This linearly growing depen-
dence of the unstable frequency on wavenumber is satu-
rated by the eﬀects of diﬀusion at large wavenumbers as
Ω(q) ≈−Dcλq2.
To understand the nonlinear evolution of the agents
in the pheromone-decay dominated regime, the concen-
tration of the pheromone is proportional to the density
everywhere, c ≈Rcϱ. Substituting this into Eq. 11 we
get,
∂tϱ + (VϱRc/2)∂2
yϱ2 = RϱRcϱ + (1 −ϱ),
(13)
The agent density can exhibit two distinct behaviors, de-
termined by the relative magnitude of chemotaxis and
recruitment.
(IIa) Chemotaxis dominated regime (Vϱ ≫1, Rϱ ≪1):
In this limit, Eq. 13 reduces to a nonlinear heat equa-
tion with a negative diﬀusivity. As the agents sense the
pheromone generated by their immediate neighbors (as
Vϱ ≫1) they migrate towards each other which results
in a pile-up of the density (see SI sec. IV A for details
of the similarity solution associated with aggregation).
This aggregation behavior is qualitatively similar to what
is seen in the PKS model, however the dynamics follows
a diﬀerent scaling law.
(IIb) Recruitment dominated regime (Rϱ ≫1, Vϱ ≪1):
In this limit, Eq. 13 reduces to a linear homogeneous
equation and the agent density grows exponentially as
ϱ ∼exp(RϱRct).
This leads to homogeneous growth
(see SI Fig. S2(d)) unlike the ﬂow-dominated scenario
where advection of the pheromone leads to polarized
recruitment and anisotropic patterning.
Analysis in 2D: Our 1D setting and analysis translates
naturally to 2D scenarios. When recruitment is driven
by ﬂuid ﬂow (Vc ∼Rc), we expect accumulation along
the transverse direction (x-axis) when Rϱ ≫1 as shown
in Fig. 3, with a concomitant narrowing of the accumu-
lated agent density along y-axis seen in Fig. 3. This re-
sults in the evolution of the density and the pheromone
concentration towards a triangular shape seen in recent
experiments with bees [25] (shown in Fig. 2(a) inset).
Our study of the spatio-temporal organization of a
collective of agents that actively generate and advect
pheromones using autonomous ﬂows to recruit addi-
tional agents generalizes the classic Patlak-Keller-Segel
diﬀusive aggregation framework and shows the emer-
gence of spatio-temporal patterns of agents that collec-
tively communicate, migrate and aggregate. We delin-
eate this in a phase-space deﬁned by the ratio of re-
cruitment strength to chemotaxis i.e.
Rϱ/Vϱ and the
ratio of shear strength to pheromone decay strength
i.e.
Vc/Rc.
For large shear strength and recruitment
strength (Vc/Rc, Rϱ/Vϱ ≫1) the agent density exhibits
successful polarized recruitment driven by the autogenic
ﬂuid ﬂow.
On the other hand, when the chemotaxis
strength dominates (Vc/Rc, Vϱ/Rϱ ≫1) the agents are
able to collectively migrate along the direction of the
ﬂuid ﬂow. When the pheromone decay eﬀects dominate
(Rc/Vc, Vϱ/Rϱ ≫1) agents collectively aggregate which
eventually results in the formation of shocks.
Lastly,
when the chemotactic velocity is weak but the recruit-
ment strength is large (Rc/Vc, Rϱ/Vϱ ≫1) the agents can

5
perform isotropic recruitment. Generalizing our frame-
work to include the orientation dynamics of agents while
accounting for the role of noise in sensing and actuation
are natural next steps in characterizing decision making
and collective response in active, embodied agents that
use rheomergy.
