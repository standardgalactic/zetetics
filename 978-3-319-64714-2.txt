Introduction and Overview: Who,
What, Why
Richard Walsh and Susan Stepney
Abstract The introduction provides an account of the genesis of this volume. In
particular, we sketch its prehistory in the dialogue cultivated by the NarCS network
between complex systems scientists and narratologists, and introduce the fundamen-
tal questions animating that dialogue. It supplies the conceptual framework within
which the network pursued those questions, and explains the interdisciplinary
methodological assumptions we adopted from the outset, and which also inform
this volume.
The scene: a YCCSA interdisciplinary seminar, with scones, circa 2012.
Narratologist:
Nice scones!
Complexity Scientist:
They are, aren’t they? We ﬁnd they’re the most
effective bait.
N:
I like the interdisciplinary environment you’ve got here
around complex systems. I think narrative has a similar
role to play in the humanities.
CS:
So your ﬁeld is narrative—stories, you mean?
N:
More or less. Narrative theory is concerned with the kind
of meaning, or logic, that characterizes stories. Narratives
can be found in ﬁctional and nonﬁctional discourses, in
different media, in ordinary conversation. In the largest
sense, narrative is a fundamental part of how we think.
CS:
So what’s the connection with complex systems?

N:
Well, one result of understanding narrative that way is that
narratives turn out to be everywhere—
CS:
—just like complex systems—
N:
—so that the concept of narrative starts to seem so general
that it risks becoming almost meaningless.
CS:
Yes, “narrative” has become a buzzword for political spin-
doctors and people like that, hasn’t it? I never know what
they mean by it.
N:
Neither do I. It’s an example of the way in which a concept
can become so inclusive that its stops doing any real work.
That’s why I’m interested in deﬁning the limits of
narrative representation; and complex processes seem to
present one, because they are non-linear.
CS:
Well,
non-linearity
is
certainly
a
characteristic
of
complexity in systems—they don’t generate nice straight
line graphs. Complex systems have interesting properties
like strong interactions between their parts, feedback,
emergence,
self-organisation,
adaptation,
growth,
change. None of these is a “straight line” process. But
why is that a problem for narrative?
N:
I think because narratives reduce complexity to linear
sequence...
CS:
Ah—different senses of “linear,” I think. One is linear
response, and that’s the usual complex systems meaning,
and the other is linear temporal sequence, which I think is
your narrative meaning. But for that matter, isn’t there
such a thing as a “non-linear” narrative, in your sense?
“The Garden of Forking Paths,” the ﬁlm Sliding Doors,
that kind of thing? How do they ﬁt? Or is that something
different?
N:
It’s different, or perhaps just a misnomer. Narratives can
explore non-linear temporality, but to be intelligible as
narrative they still depend upon its essential linearity.
The Borges story is about the idea of forking paths in
time, it doesn’t enact it; and even where narratives do
present several incompatible sequences of events, as in
Sliding Doors, they present each one as, precisely, a
sequence—they haven’t really evaded the linear logic of
narrative at all. That’s the problem I mean: if a complex
system involves a network of interactions all going on
together in reciprocal and recursive ways, a narrative
might trace one or other sequence within that network,
but it can’t possibly capture the systemic nature of what is
happening.
4
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

CS:
That certainly captures something about the difﬁculty of
understanding complex systems. Still, we can get a grasp
upon them in other ways—we can construct models and run
simulations, and these often show how systemic interactions
can produce the emergent behaviour of the system.
N:
Ok, so models and simulations show the operation of a
system rather than telling it? The distinction between
showing and telling has a history within narrative theory,
so that’s interesting. But how do you understand the idea
of emergent behaviour?
CS:
It’s not at all well deﬁned; there are several different
deﬁnitions
and
descriptions.
One
that
might
be
interesting here is the one that deﬁnes it in terms of
needing two different languages. There’s one language
for describing the system at the micro-level where the
action is, and another different language for describing
the macro-level, where the emergence is seen. The
emergent property is a different kind of thing, and so
needs a different language for us to talk about it.
N:
It seems to me that you might say emergent behaviour in a
system is behaviour that becomes narratable at another
level of representation?
CS:
That sounds interesting. What’s the difference between
something being narratable and being describable?
N:
Another opposition with a history in narrative theory! I’d
say that any representation is broadly a form of description,
but that narrative is our innate way of representing
process—it’s the form in which we make sense of stuff
happening. So we seize upon patterns of emergent
behaviour in systems because we can articulate them in
narrative form; but the narrative we tell is oblivious to the
systemic interactions actually producing the behaviour.
CS:
I suppose it’s generally true that the main interest of
complex systems is what they do, how they behave; how
to explain it, or predict it, or control it.
N:
Yes, and our cognitive framework for representing
behaviour is narrative; we’re highly dependent upon
it. Whenever we have to explain research publicly, we’re
told: “tell a story.” But for complex systems—evolution
by natural selection is a good example here—telling a
story actually misrepresents what’s going on. It’s a
problem for science communication, isn’t it?
CS:
Not just that; it’s a problem of communication even
between complex systems scientists—we’re only human,
after all!

Introduction and Overview: Who, What, Why
5

N:
Right, even when we know that the mechanism of a
process is systemic, there’s a sense in which this doesn’t
amount to understanding until we can bring it into relation
with narrative. We understand the way the world works
through our narrative structures.
CS:
But if so, given we don’t have any complex narratives,
doesn’t that mean we literally can’t understand the
complex world?
N:
Exactly! So what narrative theory needs to do is explore
ways to complexify narrative. . .
CS:
And what complexity science needs to do is ﬁnd new ways
to narrate complexity!
Both:
To the Bat Cave!
And so it began. The dialogue above, or something like it, was the inaugural event
of the collaboration that has led to this volume. It quickly became clear that
narratologists and complex systems scientists had much to learn from each other,
and potentially much to contribute to each other’s research. We drew together an
international group of interested researchers from both sides of the dialogue and
from various disciplines, and formed the Narrative and Complex Systems network
(NarCS). The nature of our collaboration immediately raised questions of interdis-
ciplinary methodology. Its whole basis was the incommensurability between two
frames of reference: what complex systems science shows us about how the world
works, and the way narrative sets limits upon our ability to cognitively grasp that
information. We did not want to presuppose the possibility of synthesis, either
between objects of knowledge and modes of knowing, or between the disciplinary
orientations that represented the two sides of the narrative-complexity problem. This
encounter between disciplinary orientations looked a lot like that between the
sciences and the humanities, in a kind of reprise of the “Two Cultures” debate of
the 1950s and 1960s, with the social sciences occupying an interesting intermediate
position to which their own internal methodological debates testify. Instead of a
presumption of interdisciplinary synthesis and the consilience of knowledge, then,
we adopted a model of interdisciplinary encounter—and dialogue. The reciprocity of
dialogue, indeed, has informed both the process of collaboration within the NarCS
network and the design of this book—and not just the decision to open it with a
dialogue.
The activity of the NarCS network centred upon a series of workshops built
around papers and presentations that articulated aspects of our common theme from
different disciplinary perspectives. The principle was that we each brought our
speciﬁc expertise to the exchange, and took from it the responses we elicited and
the promptings of other members’ presentations. Cumulatively, we began to map out
a conceptual terrain that demarcated the several domains and levels on which the
fundamental dialogue within the network was operating. We identiﬁed four quad-
rants, under the headings Communication, Culture, Conceptualization and Cogni-
tion (Fig. 1.1).
6
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

The arrangement in two columns reﬂects the two sides of the dialogue at a basic
level. Communication, in the left column, designates the problem presented by
complex systems as, centrally, a science communication challenge of primary
concern to complex systems scientists. Culture, in the right column, designates the
efforts of elaborate forms of narrative, in various media (ﬁction, ﬁlm, interactive
digital media), to imagine and grapple with the representation of complexity.
The two columns, then, represent the home turf of, respectively, complex systems
science and narratology; or the York Cross-Disciplinary Centre for Systems Anal-
ysis (YCCSA) and the Interdisciplinary Centre for Narrative Studies (ICNS).
The vertical axis distinguishes between the level of these public discourses and
the theoretical level underpinning those manifestations. In the second row, Concep-
tualization refers to the ways in which complex systems science theorizes, models,
and simulates the forms and behaviours of complex systems, while Cognition refers
to the narratological theorization of narrative as an elemental cognitive mode of
sensemaking, a speciﬁc logic intrinsic to the human understanding of processes.
It became apparent, though, that the dialogue between the narratological and
complexity science perspectives was a layered phenomenon, and that within each of
these
quadrants we
could distinguish
orientations towards the
topic that
foregrounded its complex systems aspect or its narrative aspect (Fig. 1.2).
Here, nesting within the broad dialogue between the left and right of the diagram
at the surface level and the deep level (that is, between Complexity Science and
Narratology), there is a further dialogue between the left and right of each quadrant:

•
Under Communication, the responsible public representation of complexity
science calls both for a constructive appropriation of innovative narrative repre-
sentations to complex systems modelling, for example through the hybrid, semi-
otic and experiential forms of interactive narrative; and for a critical perspective
that foregrounds the limits of narrative representation and informs public aware-
ness of these constraints.
•
Under Culture, we can distinguish between the possibilities for innovative
engagement with the representation of complexity afforded by digital media
and interactive narrative on the one hand, and on the other hand the respects in
which the most developed traditional cultural forms of narrative can be seen as
highly reﬂexive, in the systemic sense that reﬂexive cycles of development
underlie the elaboration of such narrative resources as genre, ﬁctionality,
vraisemblance and intertextuality, thematics, and levels of narration and
focalization.
•
Under Conceptualization, the theorization of staple complex systems ideas like
emergence stands to gain considerably from the implications of its reciprocity
with narrative; while even the most fundamental scientiﬁc practices of modelling,
simulating and manipulating complex systems reveal implicit narrative assump-
tions that can animate narrative theory.
•
Under Cognition, models of emergence offer a valuable approach to questions
about the evolutionary and individual development of narrative competence, and
the respects in which this development may be articulated in terms of reﬂexive

processes of abstraction from the particular, and recursive cycles of interpretative
oscillation between the particular and the general. Likewise, emergence becomes
of central interest to our conceptions of narrative sense-making as grounded in
embodied cognition, in behavioural interaction and in systemic social contexts.
In short, the reciprocity inherent in a dialogic approach to interdisciplinarity also
proves to be recursive in its operation, which gives great encouragement to our
expectations that emergent effects can arise from the research process itself.
That being so, we decided early on that we wanted the same recursive dialogic
process to inform the production of this volume, and that the process should still be
visible in the volume’s ﬁnal published form. Each of the essays presented here is the
outcome of several rounds of presentation and response, orally and in print, between
members of the NarCS group. When the essays were in draft, we formalized this
process by having each essay reviewed by members of the NarCS group, from both
the complexity science and the humanities subcamps. The process was an instructive
one with respect to the challenge of making ourselves intelligible to each other, and
also genuinely provoked new thought and intellectual progress in the revised essays.
At the end of many essays we have retained a selection of comments from their draft
readers, along with responses from the authors; in the case of the essays by Adam
Lively, Federico Pianzola and Romana Turina, we have appended a three-way
exchange between them in response to each other.
The question of mutual intelligibility is not a trivial one when attempting inter-
disciplinary dialogue of the breadth undertaken in this project. Incomprehension is
the least problematic part of it; often, the appearance of comprehension turned out to
be treacherous, and we discovered that we were using terms in quite different senses,
or that we had assumed quite different unspoken premises. The sense of risk was
tangible; often it felt as if the whole exchange might suddenly turn out to be based
upon a misunderstanding, and crumble to dust. One of the prefatory tasks we have
undertaken for this volume, therefore, is to present a reciprocal pair of introductory
chapters: one offering an outline of key ideas in narrative theory with the needs of a
readership of complex systems scientists primarily in mind; the other offering an
outline of the central concepts of complex systems science with narratologists
primarily in mind. We are fairly sure, however, that these chapters are of interest
to a much broader audience than this speciﬁc brief might suggest.
Our editorial overview of the content of the chapters is reserved for Part III of the
volume, where it forms part of the retrospective analysis of what we have learned.
Readers seeking guidance on the topics and arguments presented in order to direct
their reading may turn directly to Part III if they wish.

Chapter 2
Narrative Theory for Complexity Scientists
Richard Walsh
Abstract The aim of this chapter is to outline some of the key ideas and concepts in
narrative theory, in order to make the ﬁeld more accessible to those who have only a
passing acquaintance with it (complexity scientists in particular). The chapter ﬁrst
gives an account of what narrative is, and then goes on to draw out some of the
implications of that account for the way we think and understand in narrative terms.
My discussion of these implications draws attention, as opportunity arises, to
respects in which the form of narrative bears upon our ability to understand and
communicate the way complex systems behave. The chapter does not survey the
many facets of the problematic relation between narrative sensemaking and complex
systems (that is really the work of the book as a whole), but it does provide a
reasonably solid theoretical underpinning for the narrative problems, questions and
possibilities taken up in subsequent chapters.
1
Introduction
The account of narrative offered here aspires to be recognizable and broadly
acceptable to most narrative theorists, but it is not simply an exposition of the current
state of knowledge about narrative; rather, it takes (and argues for) a particular view.
Narrative theory, like most humanities-based discourses, is not a paradigm-based
incremental science. It has a number of competing paradigms, some of which have
gained some ascendency at certain periods, and all of which have roots in the broader
history of the ﬁeld. There is always scope for theoretical disagreement at every level,
and consensus is as likely to be a manifestation of stale orthodoxy as a basis for the

advancement of knowledge. In what follows I have tried to ﬂag areas of substantial
disagreement, but of course even the rhetoric of my qualifying statements should be
viewed with suspicion.
2
Narrative
If we begin with the broad assumption that “narrative” means “story,” we are
somewhere close to the concept. However, the term “story” has a restrictive and
skewed range of associations, suggesting (for example) a more or less extended,
more or less conventionalized form of communication, often diverting, often ﬁc-
tional, sometimes artful. Also, as will become clear, within narrative theory the word
also has more speciﬁc, technical senses (more than one, unfortunately). Most
importantly, though, the sense of “narrative” with which we are concerned is
somewhat abstracted from the sense in which “a narrative” is approximately synon-
ymous with “a story,” or even from the sense in which “narrative” is “the type of
discourse characteristic of stories.” Rather, we are concerned with narrative as a
primary mode of thought, one that has a speciﬁc form and therefore constitutes a
speciﬁc kind of logic.
Narrative, understood in these terms, is a basic way of making sense that is central
to our ordinary engagement with the world and each other. While the logic of
narrative is certainly deployed in stories, it is more fundamentally part of how we
think. Nor is it simply an aspect of our linguistic ability (it is not dependent upon
language, and may well be more primitive than language). Narrative is a mode of
cognition, a distinct form of sensemaking with its own speciﬁc and limited range of
affordances.1 Narrative cognition is an essential and powerful means of understand-
ing, and at the same time a signiﬁcant constraint upon our ability to make sense of
phenomena that resist its logic—notably, the behaviour of complex systems.
In order to clarify the implications of narrative for understanding, though, we
need to deﬁne it more exactly. The following deﬁnition of narrative is my own, and
by no means canonical, but it has the merit of delimiting the object of study whilst
assuming as little as possible about it (without falling into metaphysics). It is
therefore more abstract than most such deﬁnitions, though it allows us to arrive at
the more common ideas of narrative subsequently:
Narrative is the semiotic articulation of linear temporal sequence
I go through this deﬁnition word by word below, but to get a preliminary grasp of
it we might gloss it by saying that narrative is a way of meaning—“semiotic
articulation”—not a kind of occurrence (something that happens is not, as such,
narrative); and that it is concerned with a certain form—“linear temporal
sequence”—not a certain subject matter, or a certain purpose. The deﬁnition leaves
1Essential sources for this view of narrative cognition are Bruner (1991), Turner (1996), and
Herman (2002).

R. Walsh

implicit some features of narrative that are taken as deﬁnitional in many other
accounts, and I draw attention to these differences below. Many such features are
really consequences of the nature of narrative cognition, rather than being intrinsic to
it, and I address such consequences in Sect. 3, “Implications.” The aim here,
however, is to specify what is distinctive about narrative without saying too much
and prematurely restricting the concept.
The core of the deﬁnition is its ﬁnal term, which all the others premodify. For the
sake of clear exposition, then, it makes sense to start at the end and work backwards
through it.
2.1
Sequence
“Sequence” is the most neutral term possible for the speciﬁc formal relation that
narrative articulates. It represents a bare transition from formlessness to a speciﬁc
(total) order. What matters is this sequential form, not what it is that is sequenced.
Accordingly, the deﬁnition leaves out things (such as consequence, events, or
agency) that are certainly general characteristics of narrative, and might be thought
deﬁnitional—are indeed deﬁnitional, according to some narrative theorists. In this
deﬁnition, however, these characteristics do not deﬁne narrative, but result from the
kind of order that narrative imposes upon phenomena. It is important to maintain a
distinction between narrative thinking itself and the effects of such thinking.
“Consequence,” for example, would have smuggled in the notion of causality,
and so begged the question of whether causation is a condition for narrative
representation or one of its conceptual products. This is not only a question for the
philosophy of science but also a pragmatic caution: narratives frequently do impute
causal connections without positively asserting them, and often in manifestly
erroneous ways.
What about “events”? The event is the fundamental unit of almost every deﬁni-
tion of narrative you’re likely to come across, but that too seems to beg the question.
Such appeals to the idea of “event” treat it as both a punctual and a durational
concept. Some deﬁnitions assume that it is the link between two or more events that
makes a minimal narrative, but an event can also be understood as something with
internal structure and duration.2 Such internal structure is explicit in deﬁnitions of
narrative as minimally the articulation of a single event, but even the notionally
punctual events that comprise two-event examples of minimal narrative can invari-
ably be reconceived as durational: for example, consider the two events in
E.M. Forster’s minimal story, “the king died and then the queen died” (Forster
1962, p. 87). The narrative event is itself a product of narrative thinking, not its raw

Genette (1988).

material; and it is itself an open question whether narrative thinking is adequate to
the actual structure of processes, as this volume testiﬁes.
Many narrative theorists would also want to insist that narrative is more specif-
ically concerned with sequences of acts, that is, with agency; and I think it is, even
where a particular narrative concerns entirely inanimate processes (a solar eclipse,
say), for reasons that I discuss below. But if we want to consider a sequential account
of a solar eclipse as a narrative—and I do—then agency too is better thought of as
one of narrative’s effects rather than a constituent element. This view also applies to
a related and even more restrictive criterion for some deﬁnitions of narrative, which
is “experientiality.”3 The essential quality being insisted upon here is not that
narrative represents the action of agents, but that it represents experiencing agents;
it is about their subjective experience, not just the action in itself. Again, this can’t be
literally the case unless the scope of narrative is restricted considerably. How much?
Should there be no narratives without human agents? If not, how far should the
criterion of experientiality extend, literally or ﬁguratively? Narrative doesn’t always
deal in the human or human-like, but it does always bring its materials into relation
with a human frame of reference, because that is what making narrative sense entails.
In doing so it necessarily imposes a range of collateral ideas to some degree,
including agency and experientiality.
2.2
Temporal
The sequential order narrative imposes is not spatial or conceptual, but temporal.
Narrative is fundamentally about time, a quality which is distinct from the fact that
expressing or producing it, as well as interpreting it, happens in time. In this respect,
narration may be contrasted with description. Description is like narration in that it
takes place in time, but unlike narration in that its own logic is spatial. This is to say
that a description of a process either is a narrative, or is a conceptual spatialization of
its temporality (the latter being an important alternative to narrative in the case of
systemic processes). Conversely, a narrative may of course include spatial informa-
tion (a substantial narrative may include extended passages of description, for that
matter), but this is inessential to its logic as narrative. In this sense narrative and
description are complementary, antithetical conceptual dispositions towards
spatiotemporality.
Narrative, then, has a dual temporality, in that it both predicates temporal
sequence and is itself articulated in temporal sequence. A narrative is about a certain
temporal sequence, and its narration has a certain temporal sequence, and the two
may not directly align. This quality has been a focus of enquiry in narrative theory,
not least because the relation between these two temporalities, that of the told and
that of the telling, is often exploited in the elaborate literary narratives that
3See especially Fludernik (1996).

narratological research has tended to favour. But such a circumstance is itself
indicative of narrative’s important capacity for reﬂexive elaboration. Just as it is
possible to transform description into narrative simply by projecting, for example,
the story of an act of looking onto its discursive movement from point to point, so it
is possible for the temporality of a narrative’s telling to become itself an object of
narrative, giving us represented acts of narration. This reﬂexiveness is commonplace
in more elaborate narrative forms, and it is often also recursive.
I have already rejected the idea that causal relations deﬁne the scope of narrative,
but causality is often touted as a crucial feature taken to distinguish “narrative
proper” from “mere” temporal sequence.4 According to this deﬁnition, however,
causality (or a certain notion of causality) is not a foundation for narrative sense but
one of its contingent products. This view accords with a famous suggestion by
Roland Barthes, that narrative is characterized by a systematic application of the
logical fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc (Barthes 1975, p. 248). Accordingly, to
deﬁne narrative by reference to causality would be to make one of the conceptual
effects of narrative into a prerequisite for narrative. But might not a similar argument
be advanced against deﬁning narrative with reference to temporality? There is some
force to this objection, and indeed approaches to narrative grounded in phenome-
nology have emphasized that our senses of time and narrative are dependent upon
each other and mutually reinforcing.5 If so, it would seem illegitimate to give
conceptual priority to temporality and invoke it as part of a deﬁnition of narrative.
But, on the one hand, our experience of temporality is broader and more fundamental
(even if less coherent) than our narrative grasp of it; nor is narrative our only resource
for thinking about time. And on the other hand, it is in any case folly to expect that an
even more abstract deﬁnition would deliver more solid metaphysical foundations.6
2.3
Linear
The word “linear” in the deﬁnition serves to delimit the particular kind of temporal
sequencing characteristic of narrative, and to exclude and contrast with the “non-
linear,” despite the fact that certain kinds of narrative—especially literary narra-
tive—are often characterized as non-linear, and celebrated for that reason. There are
two distinct senses of the non-linear at stake, however. The ﬁrst, which is the sense
that actually applies to narratives, refers to the various ways in which the articulation
4For example, Forster distinguishes between plot and mere story (in his own speciﬁc sense) on the
basis of causality; so “The king died and then the queen died of grief,” he says, is a plot (Forster
1962, p. 87). Causality also features prominently in White’s distinction between annals, chronicle
and narrative proper in his own, restrictive sense (White 1980); and causality is made the central
feature of narrative in Richardson (1997), and in Kafalenos (2006).
5This is the central theme of Ricoeur (1984–1988).
6The philosophical background to the relation between narrative and time is nicely expounded by
Currie (2007); see also the chapter on time in this volume (“Time Will Tell”, Chap. 19).

of events in a narrative may not be given in a single consecutive sequence (i.e.,
non-linearity in narration), or the events narrated may not cohere as a sequence in
principle (i.e., non-linearity of the narrated). Such narratives may simply narrate a
non-chronological sequence of events or, more radically, they may fork down
mutually exclusive paths, or form endless cycles or paradoxical strange loops.
Even in the most extreme cases, however, “non-linear narrative” is strictly a misno-
mer, because these are not alternative forms of narrative so much as ways of
impeding or subverting narrative. All these strategies are striking in part because
they foreground the fact that narrative logic itself is always doggedly linear, requir-
ing an inexorable progression from point to point, one by one, even when the
narrative is structured in a way that exposes how pedestrian or inadequate this is.
The other sense of “non-linear” is the mathematical sense, in which the changes in
two (or more) related variables are not directly proportional to each other. This sense
applies only ﬁguratively, at best, to “non-linear narratives.” However, the centrality
of non-linear systems to complex systems science does bear importantly upon
narrative in two respects. Firstly, narrative is inadequate to the task of representing
non-linear dynamical systems because of its limited ability to model multiple,
simultaneous, reciprocal and recursive relations. The limitation is not just a practical
matter of our ﬁnite cognitive resources, because our reliance upon narrative
sensemaking (which is itself an adapted form of cognitive efﬁciency) makes it into
a matter of principle. The narrative conception of temporality is linear in that it is
founded upon an additive procedure (this particular, and then this, and then this; one
damn thing after another), which gives narrative effective attentional focus, but at the
cost of its synoptic grasp. Such a procedural constraint fails to address the quality of
mathematical non-linearity captured by the phrase “solutions cannot be added
together,” and therefore cannot cope with complex systemic processes. Or, to
frame the problem more generally, narrative is deﬁnitionally unable to account for
the quality in processes that corresponds to the unity of complex substances as
Aristotle conceives it; namely, in his much quoted phrase from the Metaphysics, the
respect in which the whole is (according to various translations) “something beside,”
or “distinct from” or “over and above” the “mere heap” or “aggregate” or “sum” of
the parts.7
Secondly, and antithetically, any given narrative may itself be considered to
function as a system, in that its own coherence depends upon a network of signiﬁcant
relations within the medium in which it is told. The systemic discursive realization of
a narrative may be part of a larger, prior system of meaning, such as a natural
language, or it may establish its own signifying structure, as with a performative
narrative. In either case, these systemic relations are internal to the narrative’s
operation as a way of meaning, and distinct from the temporal relations it attributes
to its referent by giving narrative form to some actual or conceptual process.
Meaning is a systemic phenomenon that narrative strongly coerces into the form

1908), Tredennick (Aristotle 1933), and Bostock (Aristotle 1994).

of a linear logic. Even as a narrative imposes this logic upon its materials, its own
dynamic production of meaning (the process of its articulation, or the process of any
subsequent interpretation of it) is a manifestly non-linear process, involving a
geometrical proliferation of signiﬁcant relations with each meaningful unit that is
introduced.8 This important quality is particularly evident, for any extended narra-
tive, in the gap that opens up between denotation and connotation; between what the
narrative propositionally says (as the expression of a linear logic) and what it implies
(through its elaboration within a system of meanings). Narratives, intriguingly, are
themselves instances of the non-linear dynamic systems they are so ill-equipped to
represent. This circumstance is crucial to the potential for cultural elaborations of
narrative to transcend the limitations of narrative form. Not only does it offer a
powerful conception of the history of narrative, it is also highly suggestive for the
further potential of emerging forms of narrative in contemporary culture.
2.4
Articulation
The term “articulation,” in this deﬁnition, serves to express the idea that narrative is
indeed fundamentally a process, a meaning-making activity, both in production and
reception. While a narrative text is a thing, narrative in the sense intended by this
deﬁnition is neither that text itself, nor something transmitted by that text, but the
basic cognitive mode of its creation and its interpretation. The word “articulation”
has speciﬁc advantages in conveying this idea. It might seem that “communication”
would be a more self-explanatory alternative, but that would limit the scope of
narrative to its social manifestations, whereas we are seeking to characterize a kind
of cognitive process. Although the conditions in which narrative cognition origi-
nated were very probably social, and possibly communicative, and indeed some
kinds of narrative thinking might appropriately be described as forms of self-
communication, even an internalized notion of communication doesn’t capture the
most elementary instances of narrative cognition.
Another alternative with less restrictive connotations than “communication”
would be “expression,” but there is a second objection to both of these terms. The
problematic implication of both words is that there is something—some content,
structure, meaning or intention—that exists prior to the narrative act, and is trans-
mitted by it. Such a transmissive model of narrative looks plausible, perhaps, when
the narrative concerned is taken to be a speciﬁc recounting of some prior conception,
or “story,” in another speciﬁc narratological sense of the word. In this view, a
narrative’s “discourse,” the telling, is conceived as the transmission of its “story,”
the told.9 A distinction of this sort seems plausible when interpreting the literary
8A unit of (narrative) meaning is a “seme” for Greimas (1983) and Barthes (1974); or a “narreme”
for Dorfman (1969).
9The distinction between the telling and the told as “discourse” and “story” comes from Chatman; in
the older terminology of the Russian Formalists, it is “syuzhet” and “fabula” (Tomashevsky 1965).

narratives on which narratology has tended to focus, not least because their narration
often prominently deviates from chronological order or other kinds of perspectival
coherence. Even in literary contexts, though, it is a problematic and contested idea,
and one that I have argued against myself (Walsh 2007, Chap. 3). But in any case we
are concerned here not just with the interpretation of extant narratives, but with
narrative as a primary sense-making process in which meaning is created rather than
merely transmitted, so we need a term with that connotation.10
“Articulation” works here because it can do the work that “expression” and
“communication” do, and at the same time convey the required sense of “structuring,
jointing; giving form to.” To articulate, then, is both to produce signiﬁcant form and,
in doing so, to express it at the same time.
2.5
Semiotic
Semiotics, a ﬁeld that was formalized by Charles Saunders Peirce in the late
nineteenth century, is the study of signs and systems of signs and the production
of meaning. The articulation of narrative is of a semiotic kind because it belongs to
the realm of meaning and the use of signs, even where these signs are percepts,
functioning within the mind’s native perceptual systems. Narrative does not occur in
the world, unmediated by the mind; rather, it is a cognitive process by which the
mind makes the world intelligible, abstracting usable sense, pattern and order from it
in some semiotic form. Narrative is only constituted as narrative in this conceptual
abstraction from the immediacy of embodied experience to a semiotic domain.
This deﬁnition describes narrative as a semiotic process, rather than a more
narrowly linguistic process, for more fundamental reasons than the evident fact
that narratives can be told in media other than language. There are certainly many
non-linguistic media that serve as vehicles for narrative, notably ﬁlm (including
silent ﬁlm), visual arts such as comics, and performance arts such as dance, drama
and mime; but this fact does not in itself preclude the possibility that we make
cognitive sense of such narratives in linguistic terms. The more important consider-
ation is that to characterize narrative cognition as linguistic would be to make it a
much narrower concept than this deﬁnition intends. Peirce distinguishes between
three types of sign: symbols, icons and indices.11 While there is a loose sense in
which any semiotic system can be called a language, linguistic signs in the strict
sense are symbolic signs, those in which the relation between the sign’s form and its
meaning is purely conventional. In order to understand narrative cognition as a
mental process operating most fundamentally at the level of perception, we also need
10My distinction here draws upon the one between “making sense of stories” and “stories as sense-
making” in Herman (2003, pp. 12–14).
11For the ﬁrst elaboration of these categories of signs, see Peirce (1982–, vol. 2).
18

to accommodate iconic signs, in which meaning involves resemblance, and indeed
indexical signs in which meaning involves direct empirical connection.
It might be urged that narrative is not just semiotic but more speciﬁcally repre-
sentational, and that the latter would be a more appropriate term. But it is at least
plausible that the logic of narrative cognition can and should be understood in
abstract terms distinct from its representational manifestations. There is, for exam-
ple, some suggestive research on the connections between narrative and music (in an
abstract rather than programmatic sense) that makes it worth keeping open this
possibility.12
3
Implications
Narrative, then, is the semiotic articulation of linear temporal sequence; a basic
cognitive mode of sensemaking that creates meaningful form with a speciﬁc tem-
poral logic. It is the way in which we are cognitively disposed to discover pattern in
processes, and to impose an order upon the ﬂux of temporal phenomena. It is
important to recognize that these patterns are in some sense there to be found, but
also that their status as patterns is irreducibly relative to a view, to a speciﬁc
cognitive stance informed by a set of assumptions about salience and relevance.
These cognitive assumptions do not bear only upon the form taken by speciﬁc
narrative representations, but also upon the form of narrative logic itself.
Narrative theory has always been a kind of formalism, but the drift of recent
work in cognitive narratology is increasingly to locate the foundations of narrative’s
basic form in our cognitive architecture. One implication of this move is that the
most fundamental features of narrative are evolved cognitive abilities, and no doubt
adaptive to speciﬁc evolutionary pressures. The actual conditions in which narrative
cognition emerged are open to speculation; what is certain is that they have little in
common with the range of demands upon our narrative sense-making abilities today.
In which case, the question is whether cultural forms of narrative, and the encultur-
ation in narrative that is part of individual development, tend to perpetuate or
mitigate the constraining features of narrative cognition. Is narrative sensemaking
bound by the terms of its fundamental logic, or can it transcend them? (I think both.)
One of the most basic attributes of narrative cognition is that it is perspectival, in
several senses. Because cognition is situated, narrative necessarily imposes order
upon phenomena from a speciﬁc spatial and temporal point, which is that of the
telling or articulation (the semiotic act) rather than that of the told. This perspective is
intrinsically constituted in narration, and just as intrinsically adopted in the reception
of narrative. Just as a narrative may concern circumstances abstracted from imme-
diate experience, so its perspective of narration may be abstracted from the imme-
diate site of cognition, and may in fact be abstracted from any embodied site of
12See Walsh (2011) and Almén (2008).

19

cognition whatsoever. What is striking, however, is that narration always remains
spatiotemporally perspectival, even where it assumes the hypothetical privileges of
omniscience, as in some forms of novelistic narration.
Sophisticated forms of narrative can also foreground and manipulate its perspec-
tival qualities by representing the narrative act itself (character narration) or by
partially aligning the narration with the perspective of a character (focalization).13
Represented narrative acts draw attention to the potential for the perspective of
narration to be itself extended in space and time, and hence the potential for
signiﬁcant change in that perspective, which may therefore have a narrative devel-
opment of its own. Such elaborate explorations of the dual temporality of narrative,
often compounded with a pointedly non-chronological relation between the time of
the telling and that of the told, are a staple of modernist literary narratives by, for
example, Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, Joseph Conrad and Ford Maddox Ford.
The perspectival interest of such narratives is rarely just spatiotemporal. In most
cases it is not the physical constraints upon the narrative subject position that matter,
so much as the evaluative constraints associated with that position. In literary
narrative theory these constraints tend to be explored in nuanced cultural terms,
regarding the ways a narrative manifests the limiting assumptions of broad ideolog-
ical or ethical attitudes, or the symptoms of a narrating character’s psychological or
intellectual proﬁle, or the motivational context of such a character’s interpretation of
events. Where there is such a narrating character, the relevant narratological concept
is unreliable narration, in which the evaluative limitations or biases of the narrator
are foregrounded and themselves become central to the implicit authorial point of the
narrative.14
The evaluative constraints upon narrative perspective run deeper than this,
however. Every narrative is situated in a pragmatic context as well as a spatiotem-
poral context, and pragmatic considerations deﬁne its perspective because they
determine criteria of relevance. Relevance is usually understood as a criterion of
communicative pragmatics, so that the narrative form is inﬂuenced by circumstances
of the context of telling.15 This context will involve broad considerations, and often
very speciﬁc ones too, that dictate the parameters of “tellability,” or what is worth
saying, for a given narrative act.16
In this sense, relevance may be understood as both a communicative consider-
ation for the teller, and an assumption driving the interpretative effort of the receiver
of a narrative. It is the answer to the standing question, what is the point? But a
communicative context is only one aspect of the pragmatics of narrative, and not
13The concept of focalization was introduced in Genette (1980, Chap. 4).
14Unreliable narration, and the (partially) related concept of the implied author, were developed by
Booth (1983).
15For relevance theory, see Sperber and Wilson (1995).
16On tellability, see Pratt (1977). A related concept is narrativity, which seems more speciﬁc, but
also invites confusion between the qualities of the communicative act and those of its object. See
Prince (1982).

R. Walsh

even a necessary one. In the privacy of narrative cognition, the same sense of point
orients the perspective of narrative sense making in relation to the subject’s context
of action, and indeed to the subject’s current framework of understanding. The
criteria of relevance that apply in narrative cognition can be wholly pre-reﬂective,
but they strongly determine the narrative’s identiﬁcation of salient features in the
object of its scrutiny.
Substantial implications follow in connection with a basic attribute of narrative,
its intentionality regarding temporal phenomena, which is to say its “aboutness”;
narrative articulates, in semiotic form, processes that are assumed to be actually or
hypothetically independent of that articulation. The consequences of this intentional
relation run in two directions simultaneously: from the cognizing subject towards the
object, and (reﬂexively) back towards the subject. Features of narrative sensemaking
activity are projected onto target processes, which are themselves then taken as the
empirical ground for the logic of narrative itself. So, the sequential singularity of the
narrative line is a feature of narrative’s cognitive form, but one it attributes to its
intentional object. Similarly, as already noted, the mere connectedness of narrative
representations themselves inevitably implies causal connections in the represented
processes. Forster made an explicit causal connection in “the king died and then the
queen died of grief,” but some implicit causal connection was already latent in “the
king died and then the queen died,” just to the extent that we take it as a narrative
rather than some kind of list. The causal explanation is open to interpretation: it may
be natural (a contagion?), social (a plot?), or supernatural (the Fates?); it may also be
reﬂexively disavowed (paranoia?). All these possibilities share the assumption that
some intimation of causality lurks in narrative coherence itself. While we may
reﬂectively critique these attributions of causality, we can hardly avoid making
them in the ﬁrst place; and critique is not always vigilant.
Other consequences of the perspectival horizons of narrative cognition work in
the same way. The pragmatic ﬁnitude of cognition demands that narrative seeks
temporal wholes, an imperative that gives it a drive towards closure that is apparent
at every scale of narrative unit from the minimal “narreme” to apocalyptic narratives,
the function of which is to impose closure upon the history of time itself.17 It is not
just that closure is a representational imperative projected onto the object of repre-
sentation; it is that this imperative is driven by criteria of relevance, or point, that are
values of the representational perspective itself. Among the more elaborate forms of
narrative there are many that make this quality of closure especially obvious. The
sense of point at the end of a literary narrative, for example, really never reduces to
ﬁnding out what happened; and some such narratives deliberately divorce the two.
Raymond Carver’s short stories, stereotypically, end before the end; Thomas
Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49 ends, pointedly, just before the crying of lot 49.
Yet that doesn’t make these cases of incomplete, unresolved narrative; narrative
closure is not ultimately about the resolution of an event, but the satisfaction of a
semiotic demand for signiﬁcance, for achieved relevance.
17On ﬁctions of apocalypse as paradigms for narrative, see Kermode (1967).

The semiotic basis of closure has important consequences for narrative under-
standing, precisely because its logic tends to get projected onto the represented
events. As a semiotic discourse, narrative is oriented towards the end; its form, at
every level, is given by the anticipation of closure, the ultimately achieved meaning
that makes sense of the whole. But, inevitably, these qualities of the discursive form
of narrative get attributed to its object of representation, giving narrative a strong
disposition towards teleology. In fact the notion of teleology, or “ﬁnal cause,” as a
principle of innate orientation towards an ultimate form, is the manifestation of a
fundamentally narrative way of thinking.
Teleological thinking is an effect of narrative form, and distinct from any
presumption of agency inherent in narrative. But narrative does strongly attribute
agency, in the sense of a capacity for goal-directed action, for reasons that are
probably intrinsic to its adaptive value as a cognitive tool in a social environment.
Narrative theory has become very interested in narrative’s role in theory of mind, or
folk psychology, on the premise that the ability to attribute motive and intention to
other people, and so anticipate their behaviour, is one of its basic affordances.18 The
agency attributed by narrative is a more inclusive concept than this, but any narrative
representation of an agent strongly connotes such folk psychological attributions of
motive and intention. Most substantial narratives are preoccupied with understand-
ing the agency of others, whether real people or ﬁctional characters, and much of the
work in this ﬁeld assumes that such understanding is a projection of our understand-
ing of ourselves. However, it is at least as plausible to hypothesize that our under-
standing of ourselves ﬁrst arises from an internalization of our representations of
others. The reﬂexive nature of such a move, to the extent that it also applies to other
selves, means that this aspect of narrative sense-making is to some extent self-
fulﬁlling, and its recursive nature ties it closely to the history of consciousness.
If narrative agency is understood as, at bottom, a direct consequence of narrative
logic, then it helps to clarify one of the most obvious effects of narrative, which is its
anthropomorphism. Deﬁnitions of narrative that restrict its scope to the
experientiality of human agents can deal with the obvious fact that narratives often
concern non-human agency by saying that they always treat their subject matter as if
it had qualities of human agency. But while there are plenty of examples to support
this idea, from beast fables to wildlife documentaries, they vary considerably in their
degree of anthropomorphism, which suggests that it is an effect of narrative repre-
sentation rather than a deﬁning quality. On this view, human experientiality may
itself be understood as contingent upon narrative sense-making. Narrative projects
agency because it is the cognitive strategy of a social animal, and it does that much
indiscriminately, but the more speciﬁc features associated with an experiencing
human subject seem best treated as secondary effects of the development of
narrative.
Another way of expressing this point is to say that narrative is not about the
experiencing human agent, but for the experiencing human agent. That is, it is not in
18Key sources on narrative and other minds are Keen (2007), Palmer (2004), and Zunshine (2006).

essence an anthropomorphic form of representation, but an anthropocentric form of
cognition. Fundamentally, this anthropocentrism is simply a pragmatist condition for
knowledge as such, in that understanding something necessarily involves bringing it
into an intelligible relation with a human point of view. If we consider narrative not
as a subset of knowledge but as a form of knowledge, though, the signiﬁcance of
such a constraint is more pointed. On the one hand, narrative imposes a horizon upon
understanding within its domain in just the way the general anthropocentrism of
knowledge implies; on the other hand it is the legacy of a cognitive pre-history with
imperatives quite different from the demands we place upon narrative today.
A further implication of this pragmatist view of narrative is worth bringing out. Its
cognitive function, as I have formulated it, has an irreducibly heuristic character; it is
good enough for current purposes. Narrative therefore always rests, not circumstan-
tially but constitutionally, upon unexamined assumptions, so that the sense it pro-
duces remains, at its core, implicit. The limits of articulate sense in every narrative
are in one respect just a pragmatic horizon to its endless capacity for elaboration,
imposed by the ﬁnite resources of cognition or interpretation. But these limits are
also the pragmatic limits of sense as such, in that narrative is not built upon some
fundamental unit of meaning, but upon the embodied nature of cognition.19 The
roots of narrative logic necessarily spring from an empiricism beyond semiotics. The
force of narrative is therefore always more bound up with what its form implies than
with what it actually expresses, and the potency of the implicit has been evident
throughout this discussion of narrative’s effects.
At the same time, the territory of the implicit provides for narrative’s most
powerful feature, which is its reﬂexiveness. The vast capacity for elaboration that
makes narrative such a ubiquitous presence in culture and daily life is accountable, in
a rudimentary sense, to the way in which the implicit borderlands of every narrative
invite further explanation, and our appetite for pursuing it is apparently insatiable.
The implicit in narrative is itself a prompt to narrative cognition, making it the object
of and occasion for more narrative. The impulse is manifest everywhere from the
child’s incessant “why?” in response to every narrative explanation, to the saturation
of culture with sequels, prequels, series, spin-offs, adaptations, fan ﬁctions and
versions of all kinds. But more fundamentally, narrative’s propensity for reﬂexive-
ness bears upon its own logic, not just the particulars of a given instance. Narrative
sense-making’s attention to itself does not only lead to its proliferation, but also its
reﬁnement. The cultural history of narrative traditions can be read as an extended
series of such reﬂexive moves, in which the taken for granted becomes the focus of
attention, or a particular meaning becomes a way of meaning, an instance becomes a
trope. These reﬂexive moves occur on all scales, from local representational devices
(the development of free indirect discourse, say) to global communicative purposes
(the rhetorical possibility of ﬁctionality).20 I said earlier that I think narrative is both

bound by the terms of its own logic, and capable of transcending them, and this is
why. Reﬂexiveness in one sense abstracts from given features of narrative and
perpetuates them in grander form, but it can also be a critical abstraction, one that
brings hidden assumptions into the light and pushes back the boundaries of narrative
sense-making.
This account of the concept of narrative and its implications has touched upon
many points of contact between issues of concern for narrative theorists and those of
concern for complexity scientists. It has provided substantial reasons for the prob-
lematic nature of the relation between narrative and complex systems, and shown the
extent to which this is a necessary state of affairs consequent upon the nature of
narrative cognition. But it has also indicated several respects in which the relation
has the potential to be reciprocally illuminating, and hints towards the possibility
that, especially in narrative’s more elaborate cultural forms and its new media
manifestations, the incompatibility can be at least partially overcome. The explora-
tions of these issues from diverse perspectives in various contexts is the business of
the essays in the main body of this volume.

Complex Systems for Narrative Theorists
Susan Stepney
Abstract This chapter provides a relatively non-technical introduction to complex
systems, from a scientiﬁc perspective, at a level useful to both scientists and narrative
theorists. It covers several complexity science concepts: it discusses models and
meta-models, and how these can be used to deﬁne the concepts of novelty, inno-
vation, and emergence; it distinguishes the concepts of non-linearity of scale, and
non-linearity in time; it introduces several concepts from dynamical systems theory,
including trajectories through state space, deterministic behaviour, attractors, bifur-
cations, and the idea of “edge of chaos”. It discusses how these concepts are used in
their own domains, and how they might be applied metaphorically.

Introduction
This chapter provides a relatively non-technical introduction to complex systems,
from a scientiﬁc perspective, at a level useful to both scientists and narrative
theorists. It covers several complexity science concepts, including models, emer-
gence, and dynamical systems. It discusses how these concepts are used in their own
domains, how they might be applied metaphorically, and where, even in their own
domains, they have inadequacies.
A system comprises interacting components and relationships that have higher
level structure and behaviour, forming an integrated “whole”. A complex system
exhibits strong interactions between components, feedback between levels, emer-
gence, self-organisation, openness, adaptation, growth, and change. Real world
complex systems can comprise any combination of natural (e.g., physical, bio-
logical), artiﬁcial (e.g., engineered, computational), and social (e.g., individual,

economic, political) parts, involving multiple stakeholders from multiple disciplines
with differing requirements and goals.
Complexity science employs a variety of technical concepts and terms—such as
dynamical systems and their attractors, emergence, self-organisation, “edge of
chaos”—in its analysis of complex systems. As in any discipline, words in com-
plexity science can have technical meanings that depart slightly, or even radically,
from their everyday meanings. It is important to understand the technical meanings,
or at least to realise where the meaning is not the everyday one, in order not to
misapply complexity concepts.
These technical concepts can be applied in a variety of domains, such is their
power. They can also be applied metaphorically, in domains where they are not
technically applicable. In order to use a metaphor well it is important to understand
the source domain, in order to understand the mapping underlying the metaphor.
There is nothing quite as unhelpful as an explanation in terms of a metaphor, where
the metaphor’s source domain is equally ill-understood by the listener. A good
understanding of the metaphor’s domain allows a richer use of the metaphor,
incorporating more of its properties and concepts.

Models and Meta-Models
All models are wrong, but some are useful
George E. P. Box, 1987
In science, a model is some abstract representation of a system, or class of
systems, that can be manipulated and interrogated, to help understand the system
of interest. A model might be expressed in natural language text, in cartoons, in
formal diagrams, in mathematics, in computer code, or in combinations of these.
The more rigorous the model (mathematics, code, formal diagrams), the more the
manipulations and interrogations can be formalised and mechanised. Mathematics
allows general solutions; code when executed can help expose dynamical behav-
iours; diagrams help highlight relationships between components.
The system of interest is an instance of the model. It may be the only instance,
in the case of a highly speciﬁc model, or there may be many actual and potential
instances, in the case of a more generic model. Parts of the system are instances of
parts of the model. For example, a model of an ecosystem might include the
notions of animals, plants, foodwebs (who eats whom), and other classes of
components. A particular population of animals and plants in the wild is an
instance of the model.
More generic models, being more widely applicable, are somehow “better”
models. But in order to make a model generic, more has to be abstracted and more
details omitted, so it becomes less aware of speciﬁc system details. The art of
modelling is a balancing act: general enough to be widely applicable, speciﬁc
enough to be usefully applied.
28
S. Stepney

A meta-model is a model of a model. In the way a model captures concepts in
reality, a meta-model captures the concepts used in a model. So in the ecology
example, the meta-model would have the concepts of entity (instantiated as animals
and plants in the model) and of predation (instantiated as the connections of the
foodweb in the model).
The meta-model gives the language for building the model. Three of the most
common meta-models in complex systems analysis are those that underpin compu-
tational entity-based modelling,1 mathematical differential equation modelling, and
network-based modelling. An entity-based model is an instance of a meta-model that
has discrete interacting entities, whereas a differential equation model (of potentially
the same system) is an instance of a quite different meta-model that has continuous
concentrations and rates of change. A network-based model focusses more on the
relationships than the entities. The choice of meta-model affects the model, and
therefore affects the manipulations and interrogations possible.
Complex systems need suitably complex models and suitably rich meta-models.
They tend to combine concepts from the two common meta-models; for example,
they are often hybrids of discrete entities and continuous components (some parts are
best modelled as “things”, some as “stuff”). This is part of what makes them
mathematically and computationally intractable.
In many cases, the underlying model and meta-model being used might well be
implicit. For example, I have never seen a formal description of the meta-model of
differential equation models, although it is implicitly understood by all mathe-
maticians. However, these models, implicit or otherwise, affect how we think about
systems, what we perceive to be important, and what is deemed novel or emergent.
Several of the concepts and metaphors of complex systems arise from different
speciﬁc models and meta-models.
3
Novelty, Innovation, and Emergence
One of the features that makes complex systems interesting, and also difﬁcult to
capture and understand, is that they exhibit many kinds of change: they have
complex structure and dynamics, they adapt and self-organise, they grow, they
innovate, they have emergent properties.
The existence of emergent properties is sometimes used as a deﬁning feature of
complex systems, but emergence is itself a slippery concept to deﬁne. A summary of
deﬁnitions from the literature can be found in Stepney et al. (2006). One way of
understanding what comprises innovation and emergence in a system is in terms of
the relevant model and meta-model used to capture the system (Banzhaf et al. 2016).
If we deﬁne novelty as a state or situation we have not seen before, then we can
deﬁne the following:
1Also known as agent-based modelling, and as individual-based modelling. Even when called
“agent-based”, there is not necessarily a requirement for the relevant entities to have “agency”.

•
Variation: novelty within the model
•
Innovation: novelty that changes the model
•
Emergence: novelty that changes the meta-model
So in an ecological system, a variation might be a change in population size of a
particular species, an innovation might be the appearance of a new species or a
species starting to predate on a different species from before, and an emergent
property might be a population banding together to hunt in a pack where beforehand
all predation was one-on-one. Whether these are actually examples of the particular
classes depends on the exact form of the model and meta-model: innovation and
emergence are (meta)model-dependent phenomena.
This ability of complex systems to move outside the model, and even outside the
meta-model, is one property that makes them “complex”. Most of our formal
computational and mathematical tools analyse and explore the consequences of a
pre-deﬁned model, and work within a speciﬁc (if implicit) meta-model.
4
Linear vs. Non-Linear
An important meta-model for complex systems analysis is that of dynamical systems
theory. Before describing that, this section discusses the meaning of non-linear, a
core concept in dynamical systems. Non-linear contrasts with linear: in a straight
line. There are different ways of not being a straight line.
4.1
Scale/Magnitude Non-Linearity
The term non-linear is used in a particular mathematical sense to mean how one
property of a system (e.g., weight) depends on another property (e.g., height). If the
graph of weight against height is a straight line, the relationship is linear. If it is not a
straight line (curves up, or down, or oscillates), then it is non-linear.
The distinction between linear and non-linear is important in dynamical systems
theory (and other branches of mathematics), because linear problems are (relatively)
easy to solve. If I know the weights of two linear systems with given heights, say,
then I can easily ﬁnd the weight of another system that has the sum of their heights: it
is simply the sum of their weights.2 This is often phrased as “solutions can be added
together”. Because of this additive property, problems can be broken down into
parts, solved individually, then added to get the overall solution. The whole is
exactly the sum of its parts.
Non-linear systems do not have this property. Part solutions cannot be added in
general. If the weight of a system scales as the cube of its height, say, then a system
2Provided zero height has zero weight. The more general case is slightly different, but the
underlying principle holds.
30
S. Stepney

with double the height does not have double the weight (as it would if it were linear),
but rather eight times the weight. In other cases, the relationship between properties
of components and properties of the whole are even more obscure. The “whole is
something besides the parts” (Aristotle 1908) [my emphasis].
Most real world systems are non-linear. Dynamical systems theory provides a
formalism for analysing generic properties of such systems, without necessarily
solving their detailed speciﬁc behaviour.
Sometimes a stronger distinction than non-linearity needs to be made: the line on
the graph is not only curved, it increases and then decreases. The technical term for
this property is non-monotonic. (All straight lines are monotonic.) In the
non-monotonic case, we have a situation where for some values of x, an increase
in x corresponds to an increase in y, yet for other values of x, an increase in
x corresponds to a decrease in y. For example, if x is time and y is the height of
the tide, then a little later the tide might be higher, but then later again it might be
lower. See Fig. 3.1.
4.2
Temporal Non-Linearity
The term non-linear can also be applied, in a different way, to models of time; this is
the meaning in “non-linear narrative”, and needs to be clearly separated from the
different mathematical use described above.
In the case of time ordering, linear means that the events that happen can be fully
ordered in a line representing increasing time. For every pair of distinct instanta-
neous events e and f, event e either happens before event f or after it.
So here non-linear means that not all instantaneous events can be ordered in a
single line. Events may be ordered in a branching tree-like structure, or in a general
network, or in a circle, or in some other non-linear manner (Fig. 3.2). Branching time
can be used to model alternative possible futures, as in Everett’s 1957 Many Worlds
interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. In ﬁction it is epitomised in Jorge Luis
Borges’ 1941 short story The Garden of Forking Paths, and used in the 1998
movie Sliding Doors, and Jo Walton’s 2014 novel My Real Children.

linear and monotonic. Lines
c and d are non-linear but
monotonic. Line e is
non-linear and
non-monotonic

There is not much use of cyclic time in mathematics or computing, as it is difﬁcult
to form coherent and non-paradoxical models. Cyclic time could mean that e causes f
and that f causes e, and would imply time travel, as you travel round the loop and
ﬁnd yourself in your own past, a favourite staple of science ﬁction, exploited with
various degrees of success. General Relativity does allow “closed timelike curve”
solutions (Tipler 1974), although it does not address the philosophical issues.
Deutsch (1998) argues that such closed curves, and time travel, are incoherent
concepts in the physical universe. An elegant ﬁctional closed consistent time loop
features in Robert A. Heinlein’s 1959 short story “—All You Zombies—”, where the
protagonist is both his own father and own mother.
Cyclic time may be incoherent, but cyclic causality can be a useful concept. The
graphical forms in Fig. 3.2 show which instantaneous events can have a causal
relationship. If e is before f, then it can have a causal effect on f. If it is after, then it
can be affected by f. If there is no path from e to f or vice versa, then neither event can
have causal effect on the other. If instead of instantaneous events, we consider events
that have duration, then such an extended event A can have a causal effect on B,
which can later have an effect on A, and so on: there is feedback in the system.
Consider the co-evolution of leopard and antelope populations: in some sense, each
“causes” the other to become faster runners.

Dynamical Systems Theory
Dynamical systems theory is the name given to a mathematical approach that can be
used to model and analyse certain restricted kinds of complex system. It is the source of
many interesting and useful metaphors—including “attractor” and “bifurcation”—that

can be used more widely. More technical detail can be found in (Stepney 2012; Strogatz
2014). Dynamical systems feature heavily (although with different terminology, for
plot-important reasons) in Neal Stephenson’s 2008 science ﬁction novel Anathem.
In a dynamical system, the state of the system is characterised by several vari-
ables whose values can change over time. For example, a simple pendulum might be
characterised by the position x and velocity v of the pendulum bob, both of which
have values that change as the bob swings back and forth.
5.1
Trajectories
The state space of the system is all the possible values the variables can take. If there
are N variables, this abstract state space has N dimensions. Each possible state of the
system is represented by a point in the state space. As the system evolves over time,
the values of the state variables trace out a trajectory of points through that state
space. This trajectory captures the history of the system. Different initial conditions
(starting points; values of the variables at time zero) of the system give different
trajectories.
How the values of the variables change over time is described by (generally
non-linear) differential equations, one for each variable. Solving these equations of
motion gives the relevant trajectory, deﬁning the motion of the state through the state
space. The state space and equations form the model. Dynamic systems theory
assumes a predetermined and ﬁxed state space: no new variables are needed to
characterise a system at a later time. If the modelled complex system changes to need
new variables, then such a model breaks down, and a new model needs to be
formulated.
5.2
Determinism
Dynamical systems models are deterministic. That means at any point in the state
space, there is a unique next point on the trajectory, determined by the equations of
motion. (The modelling assumption is that the chosen variables are sufﬁcient to
completely capture the system’s behaviour.) Consequently, trajectories can never
cross; if they could, the point at which they crossed would have two different next
points, one on each trajectory. However, in certain systems, trajectories may merge:
two different starting points may have the same history later. If a system ever returns
to a state it has previously encountered (if a trajectory loops around and merges with
itself), then the consequence of determinism is that the system will follow the same
behaviour as it did on the previous occasion: the system’s history will repeat itself
forever.
3
Complex Systems for Narrative Theorists

5.3
Attractors
A system may be started in any possible point in its state space. Dynamical systems
theory classiﬁes its subsequent history in terms of the attractors in the state space.
An attractor is a region of state space that “captures” trajectories: once a system has
moved into such a region, it never moves out again. The trajectory prior to capture
describes the transient behaviour.
There are two main kinds of attractors: ordinary attractors and strange
attractors. In an ordinary attractor (of which there are three distinct sub-kinds),
the trajectory settles down to predictable behaviour: motion comes to a halt, or is
periodic. For example, a simple pendulum with friction will eventually slow down
and stop: whatever its starting point, it will end up at the unique point attractor, the
single point in state space with x ¼ 0, v ¼ 0. Since many initial conditions can end in
the same ﬁnal state, we cannot retrodict such systems: seeing a stationary pendulum,
we cannot say what its previous history was.
A strange attractor is a different sort of beast. It is also a region of state space, but
trajectories within this space diverge from each other. Any two trajectories on the
strange attractor, no matter how close together they are at some point in the state
space, will be far apart (although still within the attractor) later on. This is deter-
ministic chaos, also known as the butterﬂy effect (Lorenz 1972), and as sensitive
dependence on initial conditions. In practice there is always some uncertainty in
knowledge of the values of state variables. If the system has a strange attractor, the
long term future of the system cannot be predicted: if the current state is x, the system
will have one trajectory, but if the state is x+ε, then, no matter how tiny is ε, the
eventual trajectory will be entirely different from that of x. The motion is chaotic, but
it is not random. Ray Bradbury’s 1952 short story “A Sound of Thunder” shows a
small effect in the past, coincidentally the killing of a butterﬂy, having larger
consequences in the future; James P Hogan’s 1997 short story “Madam Butterﬂy”
has the advantage of the new terminology allowing a punning title.
Probably the most famous strange attractor is the Lorenz attractor (Lorenz 1963),
based on a system of three differential equations that are a highly abstracted model of
the weather (Fig. 3.3). Trajectories loop around one lobe of the attractor, then pass to
the other lobe and loop for a while there, before returning. Different initial conditions
loop around different numbers of times, so after a while, trajectories that started
arbitrarily close together will be on different lobes.
A science ﬁctional use of a strange attractor features in Greg Egan’s 1992 short
story “Unstable Orbits in the Space of Lies”.
5.4
Bifurcations
The equations deﬁning a dynamical system may have one or more parameters:
values that are constant within an instance of a model, but that can vary between
models. Different values of the parameters can result in different properties of the
34
S. Stepney

attractor structure of the state space: different parameter values may result in
different positions and numbers of attractors. In particular, changing a parameter
value may cause an attractor to split in two, or bifurcate. This results in a qualita-
tively different behaviour of the system: where before it had one attractor (end
point), now it has two (two possible long term behaviours, depending on initial
conditions). In some cases, these two attractors may be far apart, so a small change in
the parameter might result in a large change to the system’s behaviour.
If a system is being inﬂuenced or controlled by a parameter, a crucial point is the
relative timescales of motion to the attractor, and parametrical change of the attrac-
tor. The attractor becomes a moving target, and the system has a meta-dynamics:
the dynamics of the attractor space itself. If the attractor moves slowly enough, then
the system can track it, and move with it. But if the attractor moves quickly, or
bifurcates and jumps, the system might lag behind, and ﬁnd itself back in transient
behaviour. If the changes are continually large, the system might never settle to an
attractor, or might jump between attractors.
5.5
Edge of Chaos
One particularly interesting case where varying a parameter changes the attractor
structure is when the attractor changes from an ordinary to a strange attractor. This
means the observed behaviour changes from periodic to chaotic. This region of
change is sometimes referred to as the edge of chaos (Langton 1990), and systems in
this region can have particularly interesting behaviours, exhibiting complex structure
on all scales, from ﬁne grained to global scales, all caused by the same underlying
mechanism. Systems at the edge of chaos seem to display a form of maximum
Fig. 3.3 The Lorenz “butterﬂy” attractor
3
Complex Systems for Narrative Theorists
35

complexity or maximum unpredictability: they are neither fully periodic (and hence
readily predictable), nor fully chaotic (hence statistically predictable).
6
Concepts and Metaphors
The attractor is a powerful concept in dynamical systems analysis, and forms a
powerful metaphor. The idea that a system might be perturbed, but then naturally
move itself back to its attractor, and that attractors might drift, change, or split over
time, has many potential applications.
The butterﬂy effect is another powerful metaphor. The idea that a system is
governed by deterministic laws, but yet is unpredictable, has had a profound impact
on science, ﬁrmly hammering another nail into the cofﬁn of the Newtonian clock-
work universe worldview.
Edge of chaos is another helpful concept when thinking about complex systems:
that the most interesting place to be is somewhere between stultifying order and
goldﬁsh-brained chaos; instead, one is poised, ready to adapt and change, responsive
and complex.
The references in this chapter give a few examples of the use of these metaphors
in ﬁction. We also see many of these terms used throughout this book, giving us an
opportunity to see these complexity concepts being used in a variety of different
disciplinary contexts.

When Robots Tell Each Other
Stories: The Emergence of Artiﬁcial Fiction
Alan F. T. Winﬁeld
Abstract This chapter outlines a proposal for an embodied computational model of
storytelling, using robots. If it could be built, the model would open the possibility
for experimental demonstration and investigation of how simple narrative might
emerge from interactions with the world and then be shared, as stories, with others.
The core proposition of this chapter is that in such a system we would have a
practical synthetic model of robot-robot storytelling. That model might then be used
to experimentally explore a range of interesting questions, for example on narrative-
based social learning or the relationship between the narrative self and shared
narrative.
1
Introduction
The model set out in this essay has a surprising origin. It emerges from work toward
making robots that can be safe in unknown or unpredictable environments (Winﬁeld
2014). That work takes the idea of robots with dynamic, continuously updating,
internal models (of themselves and their environment) and links that with Dennett’s
conceptual framework: the Tower of Generate and Test, leading to a new control
system for safer cognitive robots. We then extend this schema, with the addition of a
conceptually simple system for allowing robots to transmit and hence share parts of
their internally modelled behaviour with each other. The core proposition of this
chapter is that if we could build such a system, we would then have a model of robot-
robot storytelling. That model might then be used to experimentally explore a range
of interesting questions, for example on narrative-based social learning or the
relationship between the narrative self and shared narrative.

Internal Models and Dennett’s Tower of Generate
and Test
An Internal Model is a mechanism for internally representing both the system itself
and its current environment. An example of a robot with an Internal Model is a robot
with a simulation of itself and its currently perceived environment, inside itself. A
robot with such an Internal Model has, potentially, a mechanism for generating and
testing what-if hypotheses; i.e.:
1. what if I carry out action x..? and, . . .
2. of several possible next actions xi, which should I choose?
Holland (1992, p. 25) writes: “an internal model allows a system to look ahead to
the future consequences of current actions, without actually committing itself to those
actions”. This leads to the idea of an Internal Model as a consequence engine—a
mechanism for anticipating the consequences of actions. Dennett, in his book
Darwin’s Dangerous Idea (Dennett 1995), elaborates the same idea in what he
calls the Tower of Generate-and-Test, a conceptual model for the evolution of
intelligence that has become known as Dennett’s Tower. Dennett’s tower is a set of
conceptual creatures each one of which is successively more capable of reacting to
(and hence surviving in) the world through having more sophisticated strategies for
generating and testing hypotheses about how to act in a given situation.
The ground ﬂoor of Dennett’s tower represents Darwinian creatures; these have
only natural selection as the generate-and-test mechanism, so mutation and selection
is the only way that Darwinian creatures can adapt—individuals cannot. All bio-
logical organisms are Darwinian creatures. On the ﬁrst ﬂoor we ﬁnd Skinnerian
creatures, a subset of Darwinians, which can learn, but only by generating and
physically testing all different possible actions then reinforcing the successful
behaviour—providing of course that the creature survives. On the second ﬂoor
Dennett’s Popperian creatures have the additional ability to internally model the
possible actions so that some (the bad ones) are discarded before they are tried out
for real. A robot with an Internal Model, capable of generating and testing what-if
hypotheses, is thus an example of an artiﬁcial Popperian creature within Dennett’s
scheme. The ability to internally model possible actions is of course a signiﬁcant
innovation.
On the third ﬂoor of Dennett’s tower, a sub-sub-subset of Darwinians, are
Gregorian creatures. In addition to an internal model, Gregorians have what
Dennett refers to, after Richard Gregory, as mind tools—including words, which
they import from the (cultural) environment (Dennett 1995, p. 378). Conceptually
therefore Dennett’s Gregorians are social learners.
In the ﬁeld of intelligent robots, speciﬁcally addressing the problem of machine
consciousness (Holland 2003), the idea of embedding a simulator in a robot has
emerged in recent years. Such a simulation allows a robot to internally try out
(or ‘imagine’) alternative sequences of motor actions, to ﬁnd the sequence that
best achieves the goal (for instance, picking up an object), before then executing
40
A. F. T. Winﬁeld

that sequence for real. Feedback from the real-world actions might also be used to
calibrate the robot’s internal model. The robot’s embodied simulation thus adapts to
the body’s dynamics, and provides the robot with what Marques and Holland call a
‘functional imagination’ (Marques and Holland 2009).
Bongard et al. (2006) describe a 4-legged starﬁsh-like robot that makes use of
explicit internal simulation, both to enable the robot to learn its own body morpho-
logy and control, and notably allow the robot to recover from physical damage by
learning the new morphology following the damage. The internal model of Bongard
et al. models only the robot, not its environment. In contrast, Vaughan and Zuluaga
(2006) demonstrate self-simulation of both a robot and its environment in order to
allow a robot to plan navigation tasks with incomplete self-knowledge; their
approach signiﬁcantly provides perhaps the ﬁrst experimental proof-of-concept of
a robot using self-modelling to anticipate and hence avoid unsafe actions. Zagal et al.
(2009) describe self-modelling using internal simulation in humanoid soccer robots;
in what they call a ‘back-to-reality’ algorithm behaviours adapted and tested in
simulation are transferred to the real robot.
All of the examples cited here describe robots capable of generating and testing
what-if hypotheses using simulation-based internal models; in Dennett’s scheme
they are all Popperian robots.

A Generic Internal Modelling Architecture (for Safety)
Simulation technology is now sufﬁciently well developed to provide a practical basis
for implementing the kind of Internal Model required to test what-if hypotheses
outlined above. In robotics, advanced physics and sensor based simulation tools are
commonly used to test and develop, even evolve, robot control algorithms before
they are tested in real hardware. Examples of robot simulators include Webots
(Michel 2004) and Player-Stage (Vaughan and Gerkey 2007). Furthermore, there
is an emerging science of simulation, aiming for principled approaches to simulation
tools and their use (Stepney et al. 2018).
Figure 4.1 outlines an architecture for a robot with an Internal Model in which the
model is used to test and evaluate the consequences of the robot’s next possible
actions. Note that the machinery for modelling next actions is relatively independent
of the robot’s controller; the robot is capable of working normally without that
machinery, albeit without the ability to generate and test what-if hypotheses. The
what-if processes are not in the robot’s main control loop, but instead run in parallel
to override the Robot Controller’s normal action selection if necessary; acting in
effect as a safety governor by inhibiting unsafe actions.
At the heart of the architecture is the Internal Model (IM). The IM is initialised
from the Object Tracker-Localiser and accepts, as inputs, candidate actions from an
action generator. For each candidate action, the IM simulates the robot executing that
action, and generates a set of model outputs ready for evaluation by the Consequence
Evaluator. The Internal Model and Consequence Evaluator loop through each

possible next action; this is the loop of generate and test. The IM’s simulator
comprises three components: a World Model, Robot Model and Robot Controller;
the latter is an exact duplicate of the real Robot Controller. The World Model is a
simpliﬁed model of the robot’s environment, including the robot’s position and pose
in it, at the present moment. Only when the complete set of next possible actions has
been tested does the Consequence Evaluator send, to the Robot Controller, actions it
assesses to be unsafe.
We have implemented the simulation-based internal model outlined here in a
system of e-puck mobile robots and, with an additional logic layer demonstrated
robots with simple ethical behaviours (Winﬁeld et al. 2014), and robots with
improved safety in dynamic environments (Blum et al. 2018). That system was
able to generate and test 30 next possible actions every 0.5 second.

happened; most will never happen. Dennett’s Popperian creatures thus, in principle,
have the cognitive machinery for the creation of ﬁctional narratives. If we allow
them to ‘tell’ those stories then they become Gregorian creatures.
Assume that we have two robots, each equipped with the internal modelling
machinery outlined above. Let us also assume that the robots are of a similar type, in
other words they are conspeciﬁcs. Within Dennett’s framework each robot is a
Popperian creature; it is capable of generating and testing next possible actions.
Let us now extend the robots’ capabilities in the following way. Instead of simply
discarding (‘forgetting’) an action that has been modelled and determined to be a bad
action, the robot may transmit that action to another robot.
Figure 4.2 illustrates robot A ‘imagining’ a what-if sequence, then narrativising
that sequence. It literally signals that sequence using some transmission medium. In
practice we could make use of any number of signals and media: Morse code via
wireless, or body movements intended to be visually interpreted, for instance. But,
since we are building a model and it would be very convenient if it is easy for human
observers to interpret the model, let us code the what-if sequence verbally and
transmit it as a spoken language sequence. Technically this would be easy to arrange
since we would use a standard speech synthesis process. Although it is a trivial
narrative robot A is now able to both imagine and then literally tell a story, and
because that story is of something that has not happened, it is a ﬁctional narrative.1
Robot B is equipped with a microphone and speech recognition process—it is
thus able to listen to robot A’s story, as shown in Fig. 4.3. Let us assume it is
programmed to ‘understand’ the same language, so that a word used by A signiﬁes
the same part of the what-if action sequence to both A and B. Providing the story has

Fig. 4.2 Robot A, the storyteller, ‘narrativises’ one of the ‘what-if’ sequences modelled by its
generate-and-test machinery. First an action is tested in the robot’s internal model (left), second, that
action—which is not executed for real—is converted into speech and spoken by the robot

been heard correctly then robot B will interpret robot A’s story as a what-if sequence.
Now, because robot B has the same internal modelling machinery as A—they are
conspeciﬁcs—it is capable of ‘running’ the story it has just heard within its own
internal model. In order that this can happen we need to modify the robot’s
programming so that the what-if sequence it has heard and interpreted is substituted
for an internally generated what-if sequence. This would be easy to do. But, once
that substitution is made, robot B is able to run A’s what-if sequence (its story) in
exactly the same way it runs its own internally generated next possible actions,
simulating and evaluating the consequences. Robot B is therefore able to ‘imagine’
robot A’s story.2
In this model we have, in effect, co-opted the cognitive machinery for testing and
discarding unsafe actions for imagining, or internally experiencing, heard stories. By
adding the machinery for signalling and signifying internally generated sequences
(narratives)—the machinery of semiotics—we have transformed our Popperian
robots into Gregorian robots. Thus we have an embodied computational model of
storytelling.

What Could We Learn from This Model?
How does narrative emerge from interactions with the world? If we provide the
robots outlined above with a context—a physical environment with physical features
and, perhaps, safety hazards that they can move around in and explore—then, at a
fundamental, level we are providing our robots with something they can tell stories
about.3 The physical act of moving through and exploring their environment,
together with the cognitive act of running the internal model of Fig. 4.1, provide
the robots with a rich set of ‘imagined’ what-if actions to share with each other using
the model outlined above. There are practical details to resolve. For instance, how
does a robot ‘decide’ when to tell a story? We might, for instance, trigger this action
simply when the two robots ﬁnd themselves in close proximity; if they are sharing a
relatively limited space this could happen quite often. Another question is how does
a robot decide whether to tell or to listen—the roles of robots A or B in Figs. 4.2 and
4.3? A simple mechanism might be to default to listening, but if a robot hears
nothing for a randomly chosen number of seconds, then it switches to telling. A third
question is how does a robot decide which of the several what-if actions tested in its
internal model to tell? Here we could use the robot’s evaluation of the consequences
of those what-if actions; the one with the highest risk for instance might be the
candidate for telling: “if I had continued to walk forward I would have fallen into a
hole”.
The ‘robots gossiping’ experiment outlined here would provide rich data for
analysis. Perhaps most interesting would be to examine which simple stories are
told and their relationship to the storytelling robot’s current location in the world and
the physical features in it. Equally interesting would be to look ‘inside the head’ of
the listening robot and compare the way those heard narratives are ‘imagined’ from
the different perspective4 of the listener, given that its current position in the world is
different. A simple extension to this experiment would be to provide robots with the
ability to modify their internal models on the basis of heard stories so that, for
example, the listener robot would add a ‘potentially dangerous hole’ to its world
model. We would then have narrative-based social learning.
There are several further directions we could take these ideas.
First, consider the machinery for signalling and signifying narratives—the lan-
guage.

and

3In the model set out here the context is the here and now. But of course the story could be used to
create a different context for the listener, i.e., to initialize its World Model the story could begin:
“Imagine you are standing by the . . .”
4Note that the listener’s world model will be different to the storyteller’s, since the objects and their
locations in the world model are initialised by each robot’s object tracker/localiser (Fig. 4.1) as it
moves through the world.

robo-semiotics. While the idea of robo-semiotics is not new (Ziemke 2003) there are
deep open questions on the cultural evolution of language (Steels 2011). The model
outlined in this essay might allow us to address these questions in a new way by
experimentally studying the transition from Popperian to Gregorian creatures.
Second, consider the potential for adding autobiographical memory structures to
the robots. It would be relatively easy for a robot to build a memory of everything
that has happened to it, but of much greater interest here is to integrate the autobio-
graphical memory into the internal model, perhaps leading to what Conway (2005)
describes as a self-memory system (SMS). Two experimental possibilities are of
particular interest. One is that when an episode from the autobiographical memory is
retrieved it is then rehearsed in the internal model, so memory recall becomes
re-imagining. Another is that the autobiographical memory allows the storyteller
robot to string together a series of recalled (and now re-imagined) actions into a
longer narrative sequence.5 Each robot, even though they are in a shared environ-
ment and with shared encounters, will have a unique personal narrative. Arguably
each robot would then have, at least in some minimal sense, a developing
narrative self.
Third, consider the relationship between the narrative self and shared narrative,
i.e., the storytelling component of culture. In previous work the author has experi-
mentally explored robots able to learn socially, by imitation. Because the imitation
was embodied, imitation was imperfect and hence imitated actions—in this case
short sequences of moves (dances)—mutated as they went through successive
generations of imitation (Winﬁeld and Erbas 2011). We call this noisy social
learning. That work demonstrated behavioural evolution and the emergence of
new behavioural ‘traditions’ in a robot collective; we also explored the impact of
memory in the persistence of these traditions (Erbas et al. 2015). The robots of that
work did not have simulation-based internal models.
Consider now the possibility that we allow several robots to learn socially from
each other using the experimental models outlined in this essay, in particular
narrative-based social learning and the narrative self. We then free run the experi-
ment so that robots are able to gossip and re-tell heard stories, which then evolve and
change over multiple successive retellings. We would then have an embodied
computational model for exploring the emerging relationship between narrative
self and shared narrative.

when discussing the possibility of emergent robot culture with the author, Richard Gregory
declared: “when your robots start telling each other stories, then you’ll really be onto something”.

‘historical’ narratives, rather than ﬁctional, i.e., what actually happened to robot A, rather than
what it imagines but didn’t enact.

Sense and Wonder: Complexity
and the Limits of Narrative Understanding
Richard Walsh
Abstract This essay considers certain cognitive constraints upon the possibility of
understanding complexity, as a ﬁrst step towards identifying the most effective ways
of negotiating with those constraints. Its premise is that our narrative understanding
of systemic behaviour latches onto the system’s emergent behaviour, at the cost of a
disregard for how this emergent behaviour is actually being produced. This limit on
narrative understanding points to a cognitive borderland, in which our cognitive
engagement with complexity is felt as an “edge of sense” phenomenon. I pursue the
qualities of this feeling in relation to the (rather surprising) attempts to deﬁne
emergence in terms of surprise, and put the notion of surprise in narrative context
by invoking Alfred Hitchcock’s well-known distinction between surprise and sus-
pense. Doing so provides a way to clarify the affective dimension of the observer’s
experience of emergence, and locates it in a certain double relation to knowledge in
narrative. This double perspective clariﬁes the respect in which things may appear to
make sense even while we are unable to make sense of them; an affective experience
I equate with wonder. Wonder is, among other things, a religious feeling that
conforms to this double perspectival structure by positing that the order of things,
whilst eluding us, submits to omniscient cognition. I situate omniscience in relation
to its literary analogue, omniscient narration, and contrast it with the position of the
character narrator, in the middest—drawing upon Don DeLillo’s White Noise as
example. DeLillo’s novel provides a suggestive link to The Cloud of Unknowing and
a mystical tradition of understanding as a feeling, and even a relinquishing of
knowledge. I end by relating this mystical sense of wonder to the unnarratable,
and consider how it can help clarify our cognitive difﬁculties with emergence in
complex systems.

Introduction
I want to consider what it is to make sense of complexity, to bring it into a
meaningful relation with our cognitive capacities, both for ourselves and for each
other, and in doing so to scrutinize the parameters of narrative understanding as a
cognitive and communicative resource. I propose to take a pragmatic view of
cognition, in that I do not want to make a categorical distinction between under-
standing and other kinds of familiarity that might provide for use of an object, or for
action within an environment. This view, which assumes a continuity between
cognition and even very primitive kinds of response to stimuli, is a broadly enactivist
approach to cognition, rather than a representational approach. I do not offer direct
arguments for my preference here, but its relevance to the problem in hand will soon
become apparent.
To bring complex processes into a meaningful relation with our cognitive capac-
ities means bringing them into relation with narrative. Narrative, at its most elemen-
tary, is simply our primary cognitive model, albeit a tendentious model, of
temporality; of change, or indeed persistence, over time. It is a premise of this
essay that complexity resists the tendentiousness of narrative representation, so the
ensuing question is, how can we characterize that resistance, from a cognitive point
of view? To characterize a complex system as a system is already to have achieved
some cognitive grasp of it: any system, understood as such, is a more or less well-
deﬁned whole, comprising a certain set of elements and the relations between those
elements. It doesn’t matter, for my purposes here, whether we are talking about a
model of some real-world phenomena, or a system conceived in the abstract; in
either case, to understand it as a system is already to have achieved a certain
cognitive resolution. A system is something. All the interesting questions, though,
have to do with what this something does.
In principle, a system may do absolutely nothing—that, we might say, is the
extreme of order; or it might behave in ways exhibiting no pattern, no structure
whatsoever—that is the extreme of chaos. In either case, there is nothing more to
be said of the system; it is what it is. There is a continuum of cases in between,
however, where the system’s behaviour seems more or less intelligible, which is to
say, accessible to narrative cognition. Many of these cases are orderly enough to
be represented in a narrative form that is adequate for some purpose. Such
narratives may be very simple or extremely elaborate, but they are successful
just to the extent that narrative logic captures the represented behaviour. In all such
cases we are able to progress from talk of what the system is to what it does; but
for certain systems there is an important gap between our narrative talk of what a
system does and how the system actually does it. In these cases, our narrative
representation is not of the systemic behaviour of the system but of its emergent
behaviour, and comes at the cost of a disregard for how this emergent behaviour is
actually being produced.
50
R. Walsh

Such systems, for which narrative understanding latches onto emergent behaviour
in itself rather than in its relation to underlying systemic behaviours, are those we
would want to call complex systems. This may seem a rather oblique approach to the
question of complexity, but from a cognitive point of view (and therefore from a
communicative point of view) it is fundamental. In the face of a complex system, we
can make narrative sense of emergent behaviour only with a simultaneous awareness
that our narrative logic is not really explanatory—or, worse, with a lack of such
awareness. Mistakes of this sort can be pointed out to us, of course, but they are
always liable to recur in subtler forms. Our cognitive need for narrative sense, then,
needs to be kept in check by a meta-sense of its limitations. Must this negation of
understanding result in a kind of collapse into incomprehension, or is there an
inhabitable cognitive borderland here? I’m going to argue that there is certainly a
borderland—and, much more tentatively, to consider the merits of inhabiting it.
Complexity has been characterized as an “edge of chaos” phenomenon
(Crutchﬁeld and Young 1990); however I want to consider the cognitive under-
standing of complexity as an “edge of sense” phenomenon. In our dealings with
complex processes we can treat the bounds of this edge as, at one limit, the
perception of pattern, and at the other, the cognitive resolution of narrative. The
latter, for our purposes here, is sense. So how do we deal with the edge of sense?
2
Deﬁning Emergence
Having invoked the concept of emergence, I need to consider a little more carefully
what it means. My purpose in doing so is not primarily to deﬁne emergence, though,
but rather to consider some of the implications of certain efforts to do so. A helpful
survey of some of these attempts at deﬁnition can be found in Aleš Kubík’s “Toward
a Formalization of Emergence,” which proposes a formal description of basic
emergence in a multi-agent system. It does so on the basis of a distinction of levels
common to many approaches to emergence, and consistent with the terms of my own
reference to emergent behaviour here: emergence is a quality of the “macro behav-
iour” of a system, as opposed to the behaviour of its interacting system components,
while the underlying behaviour of these components (which may include both agents
and the system environment) is nonetheless what produces the emergent macro
behaviour (Kubík 2003, p. 44).
One signiﬁcant implication of such an approach is that emergence is “not
primarily a matter of inexplicability” (p. 46). The deﬁnition is expansive enough
to include very straightforward interactions within a system (Kubík cites direct
co-operation between agents, for example). Just because a system exhibits emergent
behaviour narratable at a macro level, it need not follow that interactions comprising
the underlying component-level behaviour are intrinsically unnarratable. The crucial
point is that these are discrete narratives, and the narrative of emergent behaviour is
5
Sense and Wonder: Complexity and the Limits of Narrative Understanding
51

not explanatory at the level of the systemic interactions themselves. This rejection of
inexplicability as a deﬁning feature of emergence is also a rejection of previous
attempts to deﬁne it in terms of surprise.1 For Kubík, appealing to the observer’s
surprise is an unhelpful move:
We believe the category of surprise obscures emergent phenomena. As a consequence there
is a tendency to consider emergence as a property of the system that “cannot” be reduced to
the lower level of description (i.e., properties of the agents and their interactions). Another
consequence is that one can only describe as emergent those phenomena for which we lack a
satisfactory notion of how they work. (p. 43)
More broadly, it is clear that for any reproducible emergent phenomenon, even
the uninformed observer’s surprise will not survive many repetitions. This seems so
self-evident, though, that the most interesting issue is not whether surprise should be
considered a deﬁning feature of emergence, but why anyone might have ever
thought that it could be. The very idea is extraordinary, and perhaps best taken as
an expression of the perceived importance of something about our experience of
emergent phenomena that it only approximates or gestures towards. Surprise, I
suggest, is the wrong concept, but its place in the literature on emergence and its
intuitive relevance to the cognitive challenge of complex systems make it a useful
foil for my own discussion.
3
Surprise and Suspense
Perhaps the best way to ﬂesh out the ideas at stake in the notion of surprise, from a
narrative perspective, is to invoke Alfred Hitchcock’s well-known distinction
between surprise and suspense. In interview with François Truffaut, he explains it
like this:
We are now having a very innocent little chat. Let us suppose that there is a bomb underneath
this table between us. Nothing happens, and then all of a sudden, “Boom!” There is an
explosion. The public is surprised, but prior to this surprise, it has seen an absolutely
ordinary scene of no special consequence. Now, let us take a suspense situation. The
bomb is underneath the table and the public knows it, probably because they have seen
the anarchist place it there. The public is aware that the bomb is going to explode at one
o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is a quarter to one.. . . In the
ﬁrst scene we have given the public ﬁfteen seconds of surprise at the moment of the
explosion. In the second we have provided them with ﬁfteen minutes of suspense. The
conclusion is that whenever possible the public must be informed. Except when the surprise
is a twist, that is, when the unexpected ending is, in itself, the highlight of the story.2
For my purposes, there are three features of Hitchcock’s account worth drawing
out. Firstly, the distinction between surprise and suspense turns upon a matter of
knowledge. The audience’s lack of key information is the precondition for their
1For example, Ronald et al. (1999).
2Quoted in Truffaut (1984, p. 73).
52

surprise at a sudden reveal, whereas suspense depends upon the audience’s knowl-
edge, as distinct from that of the characters, as the basis for its tension between
perspectives. The public must be informed. Secondly, Hitchcock’s concern is with
narrative affect—with the power of the story to enlist the audience’s emotional
engagement. His preference for suspense over surprise is justiﬁed by the quantiﬁable
increase in affective power it offers to the storyteller (15 minutes instead of 15 sec-
onds). Thirdly, this preference is ultimately a choice of genre. As his ﬁnal comment
acknowledges, there is a kind of narrative for which surprise is not only appropriate,
but the main point, and that is the mystery story; whereas his choice of suspense
aligns him with the thriller. And indeed he elsewhere contrasts the emotional quality
of suspense with the intellectual quality of mystery (Hitchcock 1970). In generic
terms, surprise coincides with the resolution of the mystery plot—the point when it
ﬁnally makes sense, and the mystery is revealed to have been merely a puzzle with
an intelligible solution. Surprise, in the mystery plot, is the affective response to
unanticipated intellectual closure. Suspense, on the other hand, precedes narrative
resolution; it is affectively constituted by an unresolved tension between two
perspectives. In Hitchcock’s example the tension operates between audience knowl-
edge and character knowledge, but in fact this is a special case; more generally, it is a
tension within the audience perspective itself. Suspense is the audience’s anticipa-
tion of an as yet ambiguous outcome, an anticipation which itself assumes a disparity
of knowledge between the current uncertain prospect and a future retrospect of what
will have happened.3 In life, too, we may feel suspense, to the extent that we project
expectations—which is to say, engage in prospective narrative. But in our engage-
ment with an extant narrative, the ﬁgure of the storyteller stands as guarantor for the
anticipated retrospective knowledge. Narrative closure is a convergence of the
perspectives of storyteller and audience, and a resolution of the emotional tension
in the disparity between them.
It is not that the experience of trying to make sense of complexity is like a thriller,
exactly. I am not arguing that the relation between narrative and complexity can be
explained simply by replacing surprise with suspense. What Hitchcock’s distinction
helps us to see is that the association between emergence and surprise puts an
emphasis upon its affective rather than cognitive impact which can be articulated
in other ways; ways that can offer a more rounded idea of the experience while
avoiding the oddity entailed by the invocation of surprise. The notion of suspense
retains that emphasis upon the affective dimension of the observer’s experience of
emergence, but also draws attention to other key features of this experience: a certain
double relation to knowledge, and a state of unresolved engagement, in medias res,
within a narrative in process rather than in response to the sudden coup of narrative
closure. Narrative closure affords the cognitive satisfaction of a resolved, transcen-
dent perspective upon the events or behaviour narrated; but if it is emergent

surprise as universals of narrative dynamics characterized, respectively, by prospection, retrospec-
tion and recognition.

behaviour, that satisfaction is achieved at a high price. The narrative coherence of
emergent behaviour, and even the level of representation at which it coheres, are
artefacts of the transcendent perspective itself. To remain in touch with the com-
plexity of the systemic process requires us to forego closure and remain in some
sense “in the middest.”4
4
Knowledge and Understanding
By speaking in terms of “making sense,” I am privileging the idea of the relational
quality of the cognitive encounter with phenomena, and with emergent phenomena
in particular. That is, we make sense of something to the extent that we are able to
articulate its qualities in terms of our own representational or semiotic resources as
cognitive subjects. But even the notion of “making sense” is ambiguous. On one
reading, certainly, making sense is a cognitive activity like understanding, and so
less about a state of affairs in itself than about your cognitive relation to it. You may
understand more or less, and understanding is pragmatic in that it may be more or
less sufﬁcient for given purposes. On the other reading, however, something makes
sense if it constitutes an actual or possible self-consistent state of affairs; if it is a
legitimate object of propositional knowledge. Propositional knowledge does not
admit of degree—you either know it or you don’t. But what if there are legitimate
objects of propositional knowledge in this sense which nonetheless elude our
cognitive capacity to articulate them? What if there are phenomena that both do
and do not make sense? This is how I want to take up the double perspective that
Hitchcock’s account of suspense introduces into the discussion. For him, that
doubleness operates between the knowledge of the audience and the knowledge of
the characters, and it is the superior perspective of the audience that provides for the
affective quality of suspense. The situation when we attempt to understand emer-
gence is somewhat closer to the general case of suspense, in which the doubleness
operates between the current prospective view of an uncertain outcome and the
expected resolution of what will have happened—in the “anticipation of retrospec-
tion” that Peter Brooks considers the master trope of narrative logic (Brooks 1984,
p. 23). However, the suspense analogy does not apply to the logic of some particular
narrative but, in a more abstract way, to the framework of narrative logic as such. We
are aware of an order, an underlying logic, to the emergent behaviour, yet our
cognitive representations of it in narrative form are unable to do justice to that
order. Here the double perspective opens up a third space between sense and
nonsense, a space in which things appear to make sense even while we are unable
4Kermode (1967, passim), who is himself invoking Sidney’s Apology for Poetry: “a Poet thrusteth
into the middest, euen where it most concerneth him, and there recoursing to the thinges forepaste,
and diuining of thinges to come, maketh a pleasing analysis of all” (quoted p. 181). Kermode’s
reﬂections on the consolations of narrative closure are the foundation for my own here.

to make sense of them. The affective quality associated with this abstract cognitive
experience is not suspense; I suggest that it is best characterized as wonder.
5
The Evocation of Wonder
What do I want from the concept of wonder, here? The word has a suggestive range
of connotations, but for present purposes we can pick out the following from the
OED as most pertinent. A wonder is “an extraordinary natural occurrence,” which
nicely evokes the double perspective I want. It is also “an astonishing occurrence,
event, or fact; a surprising incident,” conﬁrming the afﬁnity between wonder and
surprise. Wonder is also “the emotion excited by the perception of something novel
and unexpected, or inexplicable; astonishment mingled with perplexity or bewil-
dered curiosity,” which conveys the right blend of affect and cognition. Finally, to
wonder is “to be struck with surprise or astonishment, to marvel,” but also “to ask
oneself in wonderment; to feel some doubt or curiosity . . . to be desirous to know or
learn.”5
Wonder, on this account, is the affective quality attached to that region just
beyond the limits of understanding. It is the intuition of an order of things that
exceeds my grasp. To wonder, we might say, is to imagine the possibility of
understanding. It is not alien to scientiﬁc discourse; in fact it has always been a
powerful affective driver for scientiﬁc curiosity, and it is very prominent in the
rhetoric of contemporary science evangelists in popular media. The mention of
evangelism, though, gestures towards a respect in which the attitude of wonder
points to something other than just the terra incognita of the not yet known, as it
does in the frontier model of the advancement of science. Wonder is also a religious
feeling, precisely because it expresses a sense of the radically unknowable nature of
a cosmos which is nonetheless known. In this case, the other, inaccessible perspec-
tive is that of an omniscient deity.
The distinctive feature of the religious sentiment of wonder is that it hypothesizes
a perspective, that of an anthropomorphic yet inconceivably alien god, from which
the order of things makes sense entirely. It imagines a perspective that transcends
space and time and provides for absolute and ﬁnal knowledge. So that while the
premises of scientiﬁc advancement frame the wonderful as the not yet known, the
premises of religious sentiment frame the wonderful as the known, but not by us. The
religious perspective upon wonder adds to the double perspective with which we
have been concerned the additional constraint that these two perspectives are
radically incommensurable. Such a coincidence of contradictory perspectives is
there, for example, in the status of the Catholic icon, and in the Eucharist; but also
in the Protestant consecration of the Word, and especially its New World Puritan
manifestations, in which the natural world, understood as both itself and the text of
5OED, “wonder” (n.) senses 2b, 4a, 7a; “wonder” (v.) senses 1, 2.

divine pan-semiosis, becomes the vehicle for an extraordinary proliferation of
wonders.6 The religious feeling of wonder as a powerful evocation of God, then,
seems to be an ecumenical matter; it encapsulates a general intuition that the order of
things, whilst eluding us, submits to omniscient cognition. But of course it follows
that omniscience, the attribute of the deity, is itself necessarily unattainable.
6
Omniscience and Narration
The novel, as a narrative genre, has its own well-established analogue for divine
omniscience, which is omniscient narration. This is the form of narration in which
the authority of the storyteller’s perspective underwrites the reader’s “anticipation of
retrospection,” that double perspective I discussed earlier as the foundation of
suspense. But while omniscient narration lays claim, if only in imagination, to the
possibility of a transcendent perspective, it also at the same time foregrounds the
inherent contradiction between “omniscience” and “perspective,” and so the neces-
sary unavailability of such a position. The heyday of such unquestionable authori-
tative narrators in the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century novel is long gone—the
mode was a victim, crudely speaking, of the rise of modernism and the climate of
epistemological scepticism in which it participated. Some critics have detected a
resurgence of omniscient narration in the contemporary novel, although of course
the terms of such a resurgence cannot be those of old; the lack of a homogeneous
contemporary readership, for example, immediately exposes the culturally and
socially relative nature of any position a novelist might adopt (Dawson 2009).
Contemporary omniscient narration is necessarily much more aware of such prob-
lems than its nineteenth-century manifestations, yet the continuing attraction of the
mode in spite of all is a signiﬁcant dissent from the triumph of perspectivalism, of
ﬁrst-person narration and internal focalization, that we associate with modernism.
I’m inclined to claim that one reason for this dissent is that contemporary literary
ﬁction is wrestling with the challenge of narrating complexity. But since my concern
here is not with the literary potential of omniscient narration per se, but with the
problem of narration in general to which it testiﬁes, I’ll pursue the question nega-
tively, by considering the limitations of ﬁrst-person narration in Don DeLillo’s novel
White Noise. DeLillo is an author who has himself taken up the challenge of
omniscient narration elsewhere, notably in Underworld (DeLillo 1997), where he
arguably addresses the problems of complexity facing the contemporary novelist
very directly.7 In White Noise, however, he presents the narrative dilemma from the
other side, through that novel’s protagonist narrator Jack Gladney (DeLillo 1986).
Gladney, as narrator and as protagonist, is very much in the middest, and the
affective state attached to his position is fear of death. In one respect, this fear is well
6See Hall (1990); for the Transcendentalist legacy of wonder, see Tanner (1965).
7In The American Mystery, Tanner (2000) has written very pertinently on Underworld.

motivated; he has been exposed to an “airborne toxic event,” and his medical data
now include alarming “bracketed numbers with pulsing stars” (DeLillo 1986,
pp. 117, 140). But the fear is also a pervasive emotional response to mortality,
shared with his wife Babette, who has resorted to the unlicensed drug Dylar in order
to suppress the fear. Dylar’s side effects include losing the ability to distinguish
between words and what they represent. This loss of duality, or of the exteriority of
representations to their objects, saturates the novel, which is preoccupied with the
postmodern phenomenon of images that constitute their own immanent artiﬁcial
reality. The consequent lack of any possible detached perspective comes together
both with the issue of death and with that of narrative itself in Gladney’s reﬂections
upon plot. For him, “to plot is to die”; he sees himself as a death-bound protagonist.
His academic friend Murray counters that “to plot is to live,” offering Gladney the
possibility (in theory) that he might transcend his fate by becoming the narrator of
his own life (p. 291). This train of thought leads him to plot the murder of Willie
Mink, the unscrupulous pedlar of Dylar; a plot which, in the event, farcically
deviates from his own efforts to script it (pp. 304–313). Gladney, it seems, cannot
gain a perspective beyond his own, and the novel ends inconclusively, his fate still
unknown.
But in spite of this deﬂationary rhetoric there is another side to the novel.
Throughout, the phenomena of postmodern society (from TV to the artiﬁcial sunsets
caused by the airborne toxic event) have attracted a language of aesthetic awe, a
register of religious affect. The religious subtext comes to a head in Gladney’s
encounter with some atheist nuns at the end of the novel, for whom it is not important
that they believe, but only that people believe that they believe (p. 319). Their faux-
naif painting of a cloudy heaven is an image that recalls the airborne toxic event
itself, as well as its corporeal manifestation in the “nebulous mass” that may or may
not be growing in Gladney’s body (p. 280); but it also establishes a connection with
the toddler Wilder, Babette’s son who has yet to master language, who has no
concept of death, and who is described by Murray as “a cloud of unknowing”
(p. 290). The last substantial action of the novel concerns Wilder’s apparently
miraculous demonstration of his literal imperviousness to death, but I want to take
up the paradoxical tradition of medieval mysticism to which The Cloud of Unknow-
ing belongs. In particular, I want to consider this work’s claim that to know God we
have to relinquish altogether the idea of knowledge (Spearing 2001). The cloud of
unknowing is a feeling, a kind of understanding that is not knowledge, nor even the
fantasy of a higher knowledge, but actually the negation of knowledge. It is an
exemplar of what Porter Abbott calls “the cognitive sublime,” in the context of his
important exploration of narrative negotiations with “the palpable unknown”
(Abbott 2013, pp. 35–36). The pervasiveness of a quasi-religious register of wonder
in DeLillo’s novel is not, I suggest, an attempt to ﬁnd redemptive aesthetic value
beyond the opaque surfaces of postmodernity, but rather an expression of the
palpable unknown. It is the intuition of—not a deity—but a secular order of things
that makes sense even if we are unable to make sense of it.

Narrating the Unnarratable
Abbott’s discussion of the palpable unknown in narrative leads him, as well, to the
notion of wonder—which he afﬁrms, but with due scepticism: “In the business of
interpretation there are always words or phrases that serve as sufﬁcient end-points,
place-holders where the mind can rest, and certainly ‘wonder’ is one of them: as in,
What’s it about? Ah, yes, ‘wonder,’ or ‘the capacity for wonder,’ or ‘the productivity
of the imagination,’ or ‘the origins of the sacred’” (p. 51). Certainly the notion of
wonder, in itself, does little to advance the project of grappling with the unnarratable
in relation to the behaviour of complex systems or anything else; nor is The Cloud of
Unknowing an especially encouraging precedent. But the unknowable God of
medieval mysticism is a somewhat extreme case. There are degrees of inaccessibility
to cognition and, by the same token, the limits of narratability are themselves also
fuzzy. This fuzziness is inherent in the fact that narrative knowledge is in large part
implicit knowledge: narratives do not state everything they mean. Recent work in
cognitive narrative theory has highlighted the analogy between the function of
inference from the “partial cues” of narrative and the function of cognition in the
face of incomplete perception in everyday life (Auyoung 2013, p. 60). With due
caution about the scope of the analogy, it might give us some licence to think about
the relation between narrative’s limitations and our ordinary cognitive abilities to
transcend our own perspectivalism in perception. Here is a suggestive observation
from Edward Branigan, who is himself invoking Marvin Minsky: “We know the
object when we know how it may be seen regardless of the position from which it
was actually seen. The object thus acquires an ‘ideal’ or ‘abstract’ quality. It should
be mentioned that knowing how the object may be seen is very nearly imagining an
object that is not in view at all.”8 That last sentence has a mystical, poetic quality that
Branigan does not intend, since he is being entirely commonsensical in his distinc-
tion between imagining and viewing. Still, I think the idea of “imagining an object
that is not in view at all” is a potent one if we transfer it to the domain of narrative
understanding, because it is not just that narratives do not state everything they
mean, but that they invite, through the open-ended process of inference, intuitions of
sense beyond what they mean. In this sense the reach of narrative can extend into the
periphery of understanding, by giving form to the affective quality of wonder
precisely as the negative space of explanation. Narrative understanding, in other
words, can mediate between explicit propositional knowledge, knowing that, and
experiential knowledge by acquaintance, knowing of. Indeed this is not a marginal or
supplementary feature of narrative, but the core of narrative logic, grounded as it
must be in embodiment, in experience. Walter Benjamin, in his famous essay, “The
Storyteller,” gestures towards just such a conception of narrative logic when he
mourns the demise of the storyteller’s experiential authority in the face of the
modern age of information: “Every morning brings us news of the globe, and yet
we are poor in noteworthy stories. This is because no event any longer comes to us
8Branigan (1992, p. 15). Branigan’s own footnote to this passage cites Minsky (1986, p. 114).

without already being shot through with explanation” (Benjamin 1970, p. 89). For
Benjamin, “half the art of storytelling is to keep a story free from explanation,” and
for good reason. It is not just that the explicit literal mentality of explanation destroys
the resonance of a well-told tale as it does the effect of a good joke, but that narrative
logic is more fundamental than explanation—which is both dependent upon it and,
pressed hard enough, reduces to it. Narrative sensemaking inhabits the borderland
between cognition and affect, not circumstantially, but intrinsically. It is not so
antipathetic to wonder after all.
Narratives of systemic processes need not be what they so often are, obfuscatory
assertions of a cognitive mastery over the observed behaviour of a system, achieved
by suppressing any recognition that the logic of narrative is alien to the phenomenon
it is supposed to be explaining. Benjamin’s storyteller knows that the force of a story
is more powerful and primitive than explanation, and so keeps the latter at arm’s
length, holding sense in suspense. But if we apply the lesson reﬂexively, we can
suspend the logic of narrative itself and narrate, as it were, under erasure—negating
the imposition of narrative form in the act of resorting to it. Our narratives of
systemic processes would then be in a mode of “as if,” and their invocation of
narrative logic would testify to our own cognitive need, not to any property of the
systemic behaviour itself. The reﬂexive gesture is also recursive, so that by empha-
sizing the gap between the explicit narrative and the systemic behaviour, we also
suspend our cognitive commitment to the implicit connectives of that narrative logic.
To the extent that we bring those implicit connectives to consciousness, our negative
intuition extends to the further implied assumptions that accompany them. While we
do not overcome our need for narrative, in this way we make that need self-
unravelling—and so prolong the encounter, and extend our acquaintance, with the
complexity of the phenomenon itself.9 To do this is to cultivate a secular kind of
wonder, not as an affective end in itself but, quite pragmatically, as the proper
empirical stance to adopt in the face of complexity.

Abstract Adam Lively and Richard Walsh in discussion on an earlier version of
“Sense and Wonder.”
AL:
“Narrative, at its most elementary, is simply our primary cognitive model,
albeit a tendentious model, of temporality”: Aren’t there other ways of
understanding the temporal apart from the narrative? What is distinctive
about the narrative understanding of temporality? (Ricoeur as a point of
reference here?)
RW:
Yes indeed, we have other conceptual models of temporality. More
speciﬁcally, there are both pre-narrative and post-narrative aspects to our
experience of temporality. The premise is simply that the speciﬁc logic of
narrative is the form of our basic cognitive articulation of temporality. The
phenomenological orientation of Ricoeur’s Time and Narrative (1988) is
certainly consistent with this idea, though concerned with more elaborated
cultural forms of narrative.
AL:
“To understand it as a system is already to have achieved a certain cognitive
resolution. A system is something”: Perhaps another way of saying this—see
Niklas Luhmann (2013)—is that a system is something that is observed
(from the point of view of another system).
RW:
That is well put, and the congruence with Luhmann is a welcome
consolidation of the point.

The idea that suspense is in some way “open-ended” (like emergence) is
interesting, but counter-intuitive (doesn’t narrative suspense demand, and

usually receive, consummation? (the bomb explodes—the viewer is not
usually left dangling . . .)
RW:
The value of the idea of suspense here is to mediate between surprise and
wonder, and its irresolution is certainly crucial to that. That is not quite the
same as being open-ended; I agree that a craving for closure is an inherent
part of the affective quality of suspense (that is part of my point), and of
course narratives do typically provide resolution. But resolution dispels
suspense; it is not part of it.
AL:
“Retrospection” would seem to imply a form of (temporal) closure: is there
dissonance here with the earlier contrast between suspense (as “process”)
and closure?
RW:
No; the whole phrase is “the anticipation of retrospection,” and that cognitive
and affective situation, in the middest (as in my response to the previous
comment), is exactly what I want to emphasize.
AL:
It’s interesting that the deﬁnitions of “wonder” attach it primarily to natural
phenomena, but that it can be transferred to aesthetic phenomena (such as
narratives) . . . There is an interesting discussion of the manner in which we
look at aesthetic phenomena as natural phenomena in Jan Mukařovský’s
essay “Intentionality and Intentionality in Art” in Structure, Sign and
Function: Selected Essays (1977).
RW:
Thanks for this reference—I agree that there is a strong association between
attitudes of wonder and natural phenomena, and it is highly suggestive that
aesthetic phenomena, including sophisticated forms of narrative, can attract
the same response.
AL:
I’ve recently come across a couple of references on the history of the concept
of wonder that may (or may not!) be useful. I came across them in Crary
(1999, pp. 17–18). Descartes has a discussion of admiration or wonderment
in The Passions of the Soul (2015), and there is “a superb account of [the]
tradition of admiration/wonderment” in Daston (1995). And see also Daston
and Park (1998), especially pp. 311–328.
RW:
I’m very grateful for these references, especially the last, which traces the
relation between wonder as stimulus to inquiry, and wonder as a
manifestation of dull ignorance. It gives a historical depth to the
contemporary relevance of wonder as a mental state on the boundary
between cognition and affect: “As theorized by medieval and early modern
intellectuals, wonder was a cognitive passion, as much about knowing as
feeling. To register wonder was to register a breached boundary, a
classiﬁcation subverted” (p. 14). The end point of their account is “the ﬁrst
half of the eighteenth century, when wonder was demoted from premiere
philosophical passion to its very opposite, and once-frivolous curiosity took
on the virtuous trappings of hard work” (p. 305). From this point onwards,
they suggest, wonder lost its status as a stimulus to intellectual engagement
to become the preserve of religious sentiment, and so served to set the
bounds of science: “Wonder no longer set in motion feverish investigation
62
A. Lively and R. Walsh

but rather the argument from design” (p. 324). All of this resonates strongly
with the tenor of my own argument, especially the idea that conceptual
engagement with complexity requires a secularized re-incorporation of
wonder within the epistemological scope of scientiﬁc understanding.

Abstract The human mind has been described both as an emergent feature of
dynamical neuronal networks, and as dependent on narrative structures. This chapter
explores these two descriptions, and asks whether the irreducibly narrative repre-
sentational techniques used both in popular science and literary ﬁction can accu-
rately convey the systemic, nonconscious functions of the brainmind. Analysis of the
use of narrative agency in David Eagleman’s popular-science book Incognito and
Peter Watts’s science-ﬁction novel Blindsight suggests that, through the process of
enacting a narrative representation, it might be possible for readers to gain a sense of
the systemic functioning of their own brains, even when that systemic functioning is
not being replicated in the representation as such.

brainmind,1 and does it from the perspective of the interdisciplinary ﬁeld of
cognitive humanities. Cognitive humanities aims to bring together the perspectives
of the cognitive neurosciences and the humanities without conceding the former’s
priority over the latter, or losing the contextualising expertise developed within
ﬁelds such as history, philosophy and literary and cultural studies. This joint
perspective, it is hoped, will afford us a view of the brainmind that does not isolate
the biological system from human experience and cultural practice, and that guides
our focus to certain conceptual problems associated with the self-reﬂexive process
of trying to understand the system of our brainminds with the kinds of brainminds
we have.
At the same time, applying the premises of the humanities on the brainmind may
cause more problems than it solves. One of those premises is that the most relevant
part of cognition is the conscious mind as a generator and manipulator of meanings.
Such a view is in contrast with the neuropsychological view of the brain, which takes
the causally relevant parts of thought to happen below the level of consciousness or
experience. This neuropsychological view of what Blakey Vermeule (2015) has
called “the new unconscious”—in contrast to the Freudian psychoanalytic tradi-
tion—leads the humanities to the edge of what their methodology can reach,
precisely because this new unconscious has “no ready-made phenomenology, no
language in which to unfold its tales” (Vermeule 2015, p. 471). Instead of the
“endlessly nattering unconscious of psychoanalysis” (p. 471), what the humanities
are now dealing with is a split between conscious and nonconscious processes,
where only the former are relatable in terms of narrative. Together with the cognitive
sciences the humanities thus encounter the “hard problem”, or the explanatory gap
between brain states and mental states, and the question whether our scholarship
should even try to grapple with nonconscious processes. Of course, various forms of
art have for centuries tried to represent those processes and their consequences for
conscious human experience, but the question remains whether it is at all worthwhile
to represent and analyse, from a scholarly humanities perspective, processes that
arguably do not enter that experience.
This debate keeps skirting the problems engaged by this volume: the incommen-
surabilities of systemic organisation and narrative representation. My focus here is,
therefore, on a twofold problem: Firstly, the human mind has variously been
described both as an emergent feature of the dynamical networks of neuronal activity
and as a phenomenon that is inherently dependent on narrative structures. These
models seem to do their best work by focusing on, respectively, the low-level
neuronal and the high-level cognitive action of the mind, but the connection between
them is still difﬁcult to navigate. The second question then becomes whether the
irreducibly narrative representational techniques used both by literary works and by
scholarship in the humanities are able to convey anything about those functions of
the brainmind that do not in themselves involve narrativity.
1The term derives from Jaak Panksepp’s “BrainMind” (2005, Appendix C), originally introduced as
a way of avoiding a mind-body dualism in talking about human cognition and consiousness.

In order to probe these questions, I analyse the rhetorical choices made in two
texts that attempt to present—through narrative and without resorting to dynamical
systems modelling—the idea of mind emerging from the system of the brain. David
M. Eagleman’s popular science book Incognito (2012) and Peter Watts’s science
ﬁction novel Blindsight (2006) both build on the dynamical systems approach in
their understanding of the brainmind. It is also clear that both authors adopt speciﬁc
narrative strategies in trying to convey to their lay readers the nature of those
dynamics. These strategies include such traditional rhetorical tools as analogy and
metaphor, as well as, in Eagleman’s case, narrativising scientiﬁc discoveries into
brief stories about the actions and experiences of the scientists involved, or in Watts’s
case, full-blown ﬁctional—even fantastical—narrative. In addition, both writers take
the further step of narrativising the functions of the object they try to talk about—that
is, the nonconscious mental processes themselves.
I focus on one particular aspect in these texts: their presentation of agency. Which
self is the one that self-organises in these narratives? Eagleman offers his readers
various levels of the brain and mind as protagonists, and in doing so resorts to
narrative means, even as the aim is to convey a sense of the systemic mind. In
Watts’s novel, narrative agency is given to a character whose sentience and selfhood
are questioned by the events of the storyline—and indeed by the narrator himself.
But in the process of imagining an alternative form of intelligent being for that
narrator, readers make present for themselves forms of their own, lower-level
cognitive processes. My reading of Blindsight leads me to suggest that a possible
solution to the question of articulating the complex system of neural activity to our
conscious narrative selves lies in the theory of enactive cognition.

Agency, Action and the Narrative Mind
Talking about agency and action from a complex systems perspective naturally
carries some tensions. Agency can be looked at as an epistemic issue that determines
whether someone or something is subject to outside forces or is an agent with self-
determining force. This philosophical issue is shadowed by one of representation:
even when the someone or something being represented is known to be without true
agency and subject to outside forces, what representational forms are able to convey
both temporal activity and lack of agency? Narrativity is traditionally understood to
depend on events that can be presented as cause-and-effect structures, and the lack of
linear causal structures in complex systems therefore limits narrativity. Thus
H. Porter Abbott (2008, p. 233) has argued that the problem the human mind faces
in trying to represent complex systems in a narrative form “is not simply the absence
of centralized causal control, nor the operation of chance, but the absence of a
narratable thread”. Emergence, Abbott points out, is a form of action, but because
of the “massive distribution of causal agents” typical to complex systems, it is
“action without any discernible sequence of events, that is without a story. As
such, emergent behavior is by deﬁnition unnarratable” (pp. 227, 233).

David M. Eagleman’s Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain takes a systems
view of consciousness as its starting-point, in the sense of presenting the self as an
emergent feature of competing coalitions of decision-making networks in the brain.2
For Eagleman the self as we experience it is a narrative constructed by those
networks, a select pattern that gives cohesive directionality to the behaviour of the
system as a whole:
[Y]ou are made up of an entire parliament of pieces and parts and subsystems. Beyond a
collection of local expert systems, we are collections of overlapping, ceaselessly reinvented
mechanisms, a group of competing factions. The conscious mind fabricates stories to explain
the sometimes inexplicable dynamics of the subsystems inside the brain. It can be disqui-
eting to consider the extent to which all of our actions are driven by hardwired systems,
doing what they do best, while we overlay stories about our choices (Eagleman 2012,
p. 148).
This overlaying of stories is a way of making the systemic functioning of our own
minds accessible to ourselves—an evolutionary quirk that gives us the particular
advantage of being able to regulate the competing cognitive subsystems within. Thus
Eagleman presents the tension between systemic and narrative processes as inherent
to the lower-level/higher-level interaction.
However, in order to get across its message of brain-internal conﬂict, Eagleman’s
text draws on narrative conventions that give agency to the lower-level systems
themselves. The book’s opening chapter “There’s Someone in My Head but It’s Not
Me” describes the results of a test measuring male attraction to pictures of female
faces. The test showed that men were more attracted to females whose pupils were
dilated—a result that did not correlate with the conscious reasons the men gave for
their attraction. The choice, Eagleman explains, was not really made by the partic-
ipants themselves, but by elements of cognition residing below the level of their
consciousness. “In the largely inaccessible workings of the brain, something knew
that a woman’s dilated eyes correlates with sexual excitement and readiness. Their
brains knew this, but the men in the study didn’t—at least not explicitly” (2012, p. 5;
emphasis original). In such passages, and in line with his subtitle, Eagleman presents
the brain, rather than the self, as the protagonist, and the neural subsystems as the
agents in cognition. Although Daniel Dennett wrote back in 1978 that the metaphor
of neural subsystems as active “homunculi” would fade quickly and be replaced by
more accurate forms of description (1981, p. 124), Eagleman still ﬁnds it necessary
in 2011 to speak of “experts”, “factions”, “rivals” and “allies” to make his point
(2012, pp. 107–109).
The same extension of agency also takes place when Eagleman creates an
analogy between consciousness and the headlines of a national newspaper to point
out how superﬁcial our awareness is when compared to the deep layers of action
conducted by the competing processes within the brain:
2Eagleman adds to Marvin Minsky’s (1988) thinking the suggestion that rather than there just being
a multitude of specialized “subagents” in the brain, those agents are in constant competition with
each other for the “single output channel of your behavior” (Eagleman 2012, p. 107).

M. Polvinen

Your brain buzzes with activity round the clock, and, just like the nation, almost everything
transpires locally: small groups are constantly making decisions and sending out messages to
other groups. [. . .] By the time you read a mental headline, the important action has already
transpired, the deals are done (Eagleman 2012, p. 6).
And not only is the populace acting beyond the knowledge and control of the
reader of headlines, that reader has lost awareness of the fact that the events occur
without her inﬂuence:
However, you are an odd kind of newspaper reader, reading the headline and taking credit
for the idea as though you thought of it ﬁrst. You gleefully say, ‘I just thought of
something!’, when in fact your brain has performed an enormous amount of work before
your moment of genius struck. [. . .] And who can blame you for thinking you deserve the
credit? The brain works its machinations in secret, conjuring ideas like tremendous magic. It
does not allow its colossal operating system to be probed by conscious cognition. The brain
runs its show incognito (Eagleman 2012, p. 7).3
This disjunction between conscious, singular agency and the non-conscious,
proliferating processes in Eagleman’s presentation evokes the division between
system and narrative, but does so in a way that assigns agency to the systemic
processes. Eagleman has thus chosen narrativity over accuracy in this book, and
even as he wants to present to his readers a mind that is subject to the determining
forces of the systemic interactions of the brain (as opposed to being a self-
determining subject), the demands of narrative structuring force him to (inaccu-
rately) transfer the idea of intentional agency onto another level in the process.
One way out of this representational impasse could be the narrative view of the
mind. This recursive solution suggests that rather than there being an explanatory
gap between mental function and its narrative representations, our minds themselves
are narrative in form, even though their neural underpinnings may be systemic.
Jerome Bruner, in the 1990 volume Acts of Meaning, sets out to offer an alternative
to the long-standing computational view of the mind. Whereas the computational
model focuses on analysing human behaviour as the result of input, linear processing
and output, Bruner’s form of “cultural psychology” focuses on understanding
consciousness through the concepts of action and agency. “A cultural psychology,
almost by deﬁnition, will not be preoccupied with ‘behavior’ but with ‘action’, its
intentionally based counterpart”, Bruner notes. Furthermore, because Bruner focuses
on “situated action—action situated in cultural settings, and in the mutually
interacting intentional states of the participants” (Bruner 1990, p. 19; emphasis
original), it is also central to his view that the action becomes what it is not only
3Eagleman also uses the second person pronoun as a central character in Incognito. In this he
follows an established convention of popular psychology and self-help books, and the ﬂuctuation
between “the brain”, “your brain” and “you” forms a rhythm which moves in accordance with
whether Eagleman is discussing neural functions or the level of human experience. There is one
further protagonist—“we”—which appears when Eagleman’s discussion of human behaviour
moves to failures of cognition (e.g., visual illusions on p. 18). Presumably the change occurs to
avoid the implication that speciﬁc readers alone, and not humanity in general (or even Eagleman
himself), fail in such a way: consider the rhetorical effect of “Why do you fail to perceive these
obvious things? Are you really such a poor observer of your own experiences?” in comparison with
the “we” used in the original on p. 21.

because of the intention of a single individual, but also because that individual’s
intention is part of a larger network of cultural information. Thus, in order to act
meaningfully and intentionally, human beings make use of “folk psychology”—a
pool of knowledge about human experience and action that is used not only to
understand the actions of others, but also to make sense of our own experiences, and
to guide our future actions. “Folk psychology”, Bruner (1990, pp. 42–43) writes, “is
about human agents doing things on the basis of their beliefs and desires, striving for
goals, meeting obstacles which they best or which best them, all of this extended
over time”. Crucially, the organising principle of this pool of knowledge is “narra-
tive in nature”, not “logical or categorical” (Bruner 1990, p. 42).
Nearly 20 years later, Bruner’s idea of folk psychology is being developed further
by scholars combining his psychological and philosophical perspective with cogni-
tive neuroscience. Daniel D. Hutto (2009), for example, takes up the idea of folk
psychological narratives and argues that not only are they a crucial source of
information for understanding ourselves and others, but also that our understanding
of human beings and our understanding of narratives develop in a mutually dependent
fashion. Folk psychology, Hutto suggests, “is essentially a narrative practice—its
exercise, always and everywhere, invokes our capacity to construct or digest narra-
tives of a special sort [. . .] that make explicit mention of how mental states (most
prominently, beliefs and desires) ﬁgure in their lives” (Hutto 2009, p. 11). It must be
noted, however, that neither Bruner nor Hutto claims a narrative structure for raw
perception so much as “a readiness or predisposition to organize experience into a
narrative form, into plot structures and the rest” (Bruner 1990, p. 45). Also, rather
than the details of neuropsychology, Bruner is interested in the high-level operations
of human minds as they negotiate interpersonal relationships and cultural contexts.
Roger C. Schank’s Tell Me a Story: Narrative and Intelligence, originally
published the same year as Bruner’s Acts of Meaning, also uses an argument about
the role of story as a way of organising information vital to the human being. But
where Bruner sees human beings as users of the narratives of folk psychology,
Schank leans towards locating agency in the narratives themselves. Human intelli-
gence—and any artiﬁcial intelligence that would emulate it—Schank argues, con-
sists of the application of narratives of what we have already experienced
(or narratives of others’ experiences) to a new situation. Such information is coded
in our memories in the form of “scripts”, or sets of “expectations about what will
happen next in a well-understood situation” (Schank 1995, p. 7), and these scripts
are “indexed” in such a manner as to be readily available in new but similar
situations (Schank 1995, pp. 10–11). Schank’s background in AI leads him to
imply that human narrative intelligence is only an application of these pre-learned
(or programmed) scripts, which are stored and retrieved in the brain in a way
analogous to a computer. In Schank’s argument, therefore, conscious intention
concedes much of its agency to the stored scripts, and taken in its strong form, his
hypothesis suggests that “scripts obviate the need to think” (Schank 1995, p. 8).
Arguably the most far-reaching argument about the narrative roots of human
selves has been made by Daniel Dennett, who suggests that the practice of story-
telling is so central to our social interaction and intelligence that it could be said to
deﬁne our evolutionary niche: “Our fundamental tactic of self-protection, self-
70
M. Polvinen

control, and self-deﬁnition is not spinning webs or building dams, but telling stories”
(Dennett 1993, p. 418). In Dennett’s idea of storytelling humans, agency is again
given to the narratives themselves: “Our tales are spun, but for the most part we don’t
spin them: they spin us. Our human consciousness, and our narrative selfhood, is
their product, not their source” (pp. 417–418). This self Dennett calls the “centre of
narrative gravity” (1992, p. 103), a metaphor which draws on physicists’ positing of
a centre of gravity for an object, such as a chair. While that centre can be talked about
as if were an object, it is “a theorist’s ﬁction” (1992, p. 103):
The physicist does an interpretation, if you like, of the chair and its behavior, and comes up
with the theoretical abstraction of a center of gravity, which is then very useful in charac-
terizing the behaviour of the chair in the future, under a wide variety of conditions (1992,
p. 105; emphasis original).
Thus Dennett’s formulation of the self is of a postulated uniﬁed agent which, in
fact, only comes to be in the process of telling stories about itself, and although it can
be talked about as an entity, it does not exist beyond the discourse that generated it.4
If Bruner, Schank and Dennett all have searched for ways in which our mental
lives are dependent on narrative, none of them has a background in the study of
narrative per se. On the narratological side of the fence, David Herman’s work builds
on Bruner’s, and develops it towards a more analytical examination of the narrative
structures involved. Herman understands the intersection of narrative theory and
“the sciences of mind” to cover two interrelated questions:
How do stories across media interlock with interpreters’ mental capacities and dispositions,
thus giving rise to narrative experiences? and How (to what extent, in what speciﬁc ways)
does narrative scaffold efforts to make sense of experience itself? (Herman 2013a, p. 421)
Herman is thus focused on analysing the structures of stories as “models of
action” (2009, p. 40), both in the sense of learned action-structures having narrative
form, and in the sense of stories coding within themselves various action-structures
that can then be examined—for the better comprehension of both the nature of
human action and the nature of narrative. Stories, Herman suggests, are cognitive
tools in the Vygotskian sense: they are “a primary technology for making sense of
how things unfold in time [. . .], one that helps reveal how actions arise, how they are
interrelated, and how much salience they should be assigned within a given envi-
ronment for acting and interacting” (Herman 2013a, p. 431). As with Bruner,
Herman’s focus remains on the higher levels of cognition, and he explicitly steps
away from claiming a role for narrative sensemaking on the nonconscious level
(2013b, p. 73).
The paradigm of the narrative self thus argues that narrative can be an accurate
form of representation for mind and consciousness, since those phenomena are
4Dennett’s version of the narrative self has engaged the imaginations of many literary authors, such
as the American novelist John Barth, who ﬁnds the idea to be in perfect concert with his own
fascination with the ﬁgure of Scheherazade—a character who told herself into life and who is, for
Barth, “the (ﬁctionalistical, as-ifish) scenario-spinner that is the continuously auto-creating self of
every one of us” (Barth 1995, p. 196; emphasis original; see also Polvinen 2008, pp. 141–186). For
arguments against the idea of a narrative self, see Strawson (2004).

themselves narrative processes. At the same time, however, it does not fully take on
the hard problem of the gap between conscious experience and the systemic neural
level.
3
Mind as a Complex System
The roots of the dynamical systems approaches to cognition lie in the cybernetic
revolution of the 1940s and 1950s, in the work of McCulloch, of Shannon and
Weaver, and of von Neumann (Port and van Gelder 1995b, p. 36), as well as in the
more “organismic” theories of biological systems in the 1960s and 1970s (Thelen
and Smith 1994, p. xix). An initial split between two approaches—one focusing on
computational models and another gravitating towards neural networks—eventually
led to the latter developing in the 1980s into connectionism, and further into
dynamical systems approaches (Port and van Gelder 1995b, pp. 36–39). Today,
the view that at least at the neuronal level the best form of description for the
brainmind is a dynamical one is widely shared, and the central metaphor of mind
as a computer has been overtaken by that of mind as a living, interacting system.
The central tenets of the dynamical systems view of mind and brain are:
The cognitive system is not a computer, it is a dynamical system. It is not the brain, inner and
encapsulated; rather, it is the whole system comprised of nervous system, body, and
environment. The cognitive system is not a discrete sequential manipulator of static repre-
sentational structure; rather it is a structure of mutually and simultaneously inﬂuencing
change. Its processes do not take place in the arbitrary, discrete time of computer steps;
rather, they unfold in the real time of ongoing change in the environment, the body, and the
nervous system. The cognitive system does not interact with other aspects of the world by
passing messages or commands; rather, it continuously coevolves with them (Port and van
Gelder 1995b, p. 3; emphases original).
The study of the brainmind from the perspective of dynamical systems theory has,
accordingly, moved from symbol-based models and computational logic to studying
rates of change and phase-space trajectories that are seen to correspond to some
observable behaviours. For example, the methods used by the scholars published in
Port and van Gelder’s 1995 volume Mind as Motion: Explorations in the Dynamics
of Cognition include both quantitative and qualitative modelling, as well as systems-
theoretically informed description of the cognitive systems under study. With these
tools the chapters examine issues such as language processing, the binding problem
and the early childhood development of embodied cognition.5
If the dynamical view may now be said to be accepted as a description of
interactions on the neuronal level, it is also possible to take it as a way of
undermining the need for different approaches for lower-level and higher-level
processes. Whereas the dominant model of computational cognitivism took
5Emotions have become much more central for the cognitive sciences since the 1990s, and
emotional episodes have also been seen in terms of dynamical patterns (Colombetti 2014,
pp. 53–82).

cognition to consist of two different processes—unconscious symbolic computation
on the one hand, and conscious experience on the other—the dynamical view takes
that distinction to be “a contemporary remnant of the traditional philosophical view
that mind is somehow fundamentally distinct in nature from the material world (the
body and the external physical world)” (Port and van Gelder 1995a, p. viii). Thus, “if
we are interested in cognitive systems, then the behaviors of interest are their
cognitive performances (perceiving, remembering, conversing, etc.), and it is these
behaviors, at their characteristic time scales, that must unfold in a way described by
the rule of [mathematical] evolution” (Port and van Gelder 1995b, p. 11; emphases
original). Similarly, Esther Thelen and Linda B. Smith suggest that dynamical
systems theory can break down the barrier between ways of understanding the
lower-order processes of brain organisation on the one hand, and the higher-order
processes of complex perception and cognition on the other. Abstract reasoning and
metacognition, they argue, “are in principle no different from the less-abstract
mental operations upon which they are ontogenetically based, and that, indeed, a
common dynamic must unify all brain function as well as changes in brain and
behavior” (Thelen and Smith 1994, p. 312).
However, Thelen and Smith also note the danger of thinking that just because the
dynamics of the behaviour remains the same across various levels of cognition, the
processes themselves repeat from one level to the next. An act such as that of
weaving a fabric, and the act of thinking about weaving are different, Thelen and
Smith insist, and should not be expected to consist of the same patterns:
Thinking, like weaving, is a behavior, a product of the entire system’s activity. However, the
patterns of activity that are weaving and the patterns of activity that are thinking about
weaving are not the same nor is one in any way contained within the other or ‘raised up’ to
form the other (p. 337).
Also, and in accordance with the dynamical systems theory more generally, this
model of mind separates the idea of “activity” from the idea of “action”—from
intention and agency—and thus gives it a very different role than the narrative
paradigm does. The presence of agency and intentionality in representations of
dynamical systems, therefore, tends to give them a false sense of teleology—but at
the same time our understanding of those systems depends on our ability to represent
them in ways that make sense to us. So even if the dynamical systems view of the
brain shows us all cognitive performance in terms of the same dynamics, the
question remains how a narrative representation could articulate the agentless
processes of nonconscious cognition.

Enacting Complexity
Peter Watts’s science ﬁction novel Blindsight (2006) presents the problem of lower
and higher-level processing in much the same way as Eagleman in his popular-
science book. The novel takes the form of a classic ﬁrst-contact story: an expedition
of specialists is sent into deep space to intercept an alien vessel that has sent a group
7
A Simple Story of a Complex Mind?
73

of probes to Earth. Among the technicians, military experts and linguists, the
expedition includes the novel’s narrator, Siri Keeton, a “Synthesist” or ofﬁcial
observer. Due to severe epilepsy he suffered as a child, Siri has had half of his
brain removed and replaced with an extensive computer databank and processor,
making him uniquely able to analyse massive amounts of data for their large-scale
patterns. At the same time, however, he has lost the ability to intuitively reﬂect on the
relationship between himself and his environment, and is forced to rely on learned
algorithms to interpret the actions and intentions of those around him. While his
computer-assisted mind is able to analyse incredible masses of data on the surface
behaviour of both the alien creatures and the people around him, as well as creating
solutions on the basis of that data, Keeton is initially unable to properly access those
levels of his own intelligence, which makes his sense of self muted and fragmented.
Keeton’s mirror image in the novel is the alien the team encounters: a form of life
that is massively intelligent but without sentience. Without a conscious self, the alien
creatures, or “scramblers”, embody the idea of multiple brain processes that do the
actual work of cognising before consciousness has even an inkling of a decision
needing to be made. “Imagine you’re a scrambler”, Keeton exhorts both himself and
the novel’s readers, in an attempt to understand what the team is facing. “Imagine
you have intellect but no insight, agendas but no awareness. Your circuitry hums
with strategies for survival and persistence, ﬂexible, intelligent, even technologi-
cal—but no other circuitry monitors it. You can think of anything, yet are conscious
of nothing” (Watts 2006, p. 323; emphasis original).6 The novel’s storyline develops
towards the predictable disaster, with Keeton the only survivor, and it does so by
weaving together Keeton’s voice and personality with the slow revelation of the
scramblers’ strange form of cognition. At the same time as readers’ understanding of
the nature of the scramblers’ intelligence grows, Keeton gains an intuitive connec-
tion to the processes of his modiﬁed brain. Initially, reﬂective awareness appears in
his experience as moments of the blindsight the novel’s title refers to: as ﬂeeting
visualisations in the corner of his eye that result from one part of his brain attempting
to tell his conscious mind something by “passing notes under the table” (p. 319). By
the end, Keeton’s intuitive connection to his own subroutines is restored, making
him able to tell the narrative he tells—a narrative that is much more than the surface
data of the events he witnessed. “And now the game is over, and a single pawn
stands on that scorched board and its face is human after all” (p. 360).
What makes Watts’s novel particularly interesting in comparison to Eagleman’s
popular-science depiction is its choice of narrator and the consequent imaginative
actions readers are asked to perform. Keeton frequently takes up second-person
narration to command himself to imagine being something else—either the alien
creatures or one of the crewmembers. For Keeton, the command to imagine is a way
of bootstrapping himself towards human sentience, of creating the reﬂective layer
that intelligence needs in order to become aware of both its own processes and of the
6For a detailed reading of the beneﬁts of nonconscious cognition in Watts’s novel, see Hayles
(2017, pp. 96–111).

thoughts and intentions of other beings. The same command, however, also applies
to the novel’s readers, who, by actively imagining the characters and events of the
ﬁction, exercise their own sentience: “Imagine you are Siri Keeton”, begins the
novel proper. At its end, the now fully cognitively human narrator reminds his
audience that even in his restored state, they cannot just take his word as proof of
sentience, but that like the Chinese room, he might just be “faking it”, and that the
readers’ only access to his sentience is through empathetic imagination. “So, I can’t
really tell you, one way or the other. You’ll just have to imagine you’re Siri Keeton”
(pp. 21, 362).
Blindsight creates an opportunity for readers to go through a cognitive process not
otherwise available to them, and in this it partakes in one of the shared roles of all
ﬁctional narratives. What is unusual about it is its attempt to use the general toolbox
of ﬁction to give its readers an intimation of nonconscious processing—to activate
what Richard Walsh (this volume, Chap. 5) calls a “sense of wonder” about the
systemic interactions that we otherwise ﬁnd difﬁcult to make sense of. Thus, while
the narrative and dynamical systems models of the mind may both have their
separate roles to play in our descriptions of the lower and higher levels of mental
action, I also wish to examine the ways in which narrative might help the mind to
make its own systemic elements present for the reﬂective, narrative consciousness. Is
it possible for narrative representation to engage consciousness in systemic think-
ing—that is, is it possible for readers of Eagleman or Watts to gain a sense of the
complex system of their own brains while having it represented to them in a narrative
form, rather than through the system-based forms of thought made possible by
mathematics and visual illustrations?
One description of how such a process might be possible is the theory of enactive
cognition, which inherited the willingness shown in the 1990s in the works of Port
and van Gelder, and Thelen and Smith, to engage dynamical systems theory and
methods in the study of the higher levels of cognitive functioning. Francisco Varela
and Evan Thompson, in particular, have been on the forefront of fashioning a model
of enactive cognition on the basis of autopoiesis, connecting the physical properties
of living beings with the organisational properties of life as well as those of mental
processing. In this view, cognition is understood to mean simply all the activities of a
biological system that can be deﬁned as information processing, including the
organismic regulation of the body and the sensorimotor coupling between the
organism and its environment. In this sense, all life could be deﬁned as cognition
of some sort or another. The kind of cognition that humans practice—including
intersubjective interaction and recognition of intentional action—is seen as an
extension of, rather than a departure from, this basic kind of information exchange
between an organism and its environment (e.g., Varela et al. 1993).
The three main points of enactive cognitive science have been formulated as
follows:
1. [U]nderstanding the complex interplay of brain, body, and world requires the tools and
methods of nonlinear dynamical systems theory;
2. traditional notions of representation and computation are inadequate;
7
A Simple Story of a Complex Mind?
75

3. traditional decompositions of the cognitive system into inner functional subsystems or
modules (“boxology”) are misleading, and blind us to arguably better decompositions
into dynamical systems that cut across the brain–body–world divisions (Thompson and
Varela 2001, p. 418).
Enactive cognition thus conceptualises the organisation of mind very differently
from the traditional computational models, where the emphasis is on the interaction
of processing units within the brain. Here the focus is on how large-scale brain
activity emerges out of the transient integration of neural events, as well as on how
the sensorimotor coupling of the embodied mind with its environment has to be
understood as a feedback loop. So even if the idea of autopoiesis roots enaction in
the very lowest levels of cognition, the enactive approach also aims to understand
higher-level cognitive processing, as well as offer an explanation of the join between
the two. This is because the autopoietic feedback loops between the organism and its
environment also involve the concept of the enacting agent. As argued by Di Paolo,
Rhode and De Jaegher in a seminal collection of essays on enaction, “[a]utonomous
agency goes even further than the recognition of ongoing sensorimotor couplings as
dynamical and emphasizes the role of the agent in the constructing, organizing,
maintaining, and regulating those closed sensorimotor loops” (2010, p. 39). In doing
so, a cognitive agent enacts a world for itself, even as its own being is determined by
that world. Thus agency and the environment are tied together in a process that
generates not only the agency itself (as a living, cognising being) but also the
environment in which that agent operates. In the case of Watts’s narrative, we
enter a similar feedback relationship: one where the ﬁction as a cognitive environ-
ment is constituted by our mental actions, but also where that environment
changes—both by limiting and by extending—the actions we can take.
Enactive cognitive science has not so far given much attention to narrative.
Enaction is an approach mostly used in the study of sensory perception and sense-
making, and even though it has recently been applied to the development of
symbolic action in, for example, make-believe, this tends to be done in a way that
ignores extended temporality.7 However, the central role of narrative in human
imagination makes it natural to seek further purchase between enactive cognition
and narrative, and to elaborate the role of different forms of action in the enactive
sense-making. What makes the enactive view relevant for the discussion on narrative
and complexity in particular is, therefore, not only the way it connects these
processes of autopoiesis all the way up to the level of conscious thought, but also
the fact that enactment offers a way of conceptualising a form of conscious, narrative
7Thus, when Di Paolo, Rhode and De Jaegher speak of a child imagining a spoon to be a car, they
focus on the embodied action of the play, rather than on the possibility of a storytelling frame for the
action: “When a child skillfully supplements the perceptual lack of similarity between a spoon and a
car by making the spoon move and sound like a car, he or she has grasped in an embodied manner
the extent to which perception can be action-mediated. With his or her body, the child can now alter
sense-making activity, both on external objects, as well as his or her own actions and those of
others” (2010, p. 78).

access to our own systemic minds. Despite the fact that narrative descriptions may
lose the speciﬁcally systemic characteristics of the complex system they try to depict,
the enactive perspective suggests that through the process of participating in the
sense-making encoded in a narrative we might still be able to gain access to those
characteristics, and to inhabit what Richard Walsh calls “the edge of sense” (this
volume, Chap. 5). Thus the mind might be able to constitute for itself—in the
phenomenological sense of bringing to awareness—its own systemic functioning
in the enaction of a narrative representation, rather than the systemic functioning
being replicated in the representation as such.

Conclusion
It would be premature to claim that the problem of representing complexity in
narrative is solved by the arrival of the theory of enactive cognition, as research
into the interplay of narrativity and complex systems is only beginning. What
enactive cognition does point us towards is the need to examine more carefully the
uses of various structural, metaphorical and narrativising techniques within popular
science and other texts that attempt to convey the idea of complexity to a
non-specialist audience. This kind of research might be able to ﬁnd new ways of
discussing the rhetorical effects of such writing, as well as extend our existing
understanding of the effects of narrative engagement with the help of the enactive
paradigm. If it seems inescapable that narrative models of complexity do not share
the speciﬁcally systemic elements, then perhaps mapping the thing represented and
its representation on each other is, indeed, the wrong way to look at the problem at
hand. Instead, the enactive view offers us a way of looking at what kind of
combination of narrativity and metaphoric or symbolic representation is capable of
triggering the imagining of complex systems in our minds.
As Marco Bernini also suggests in this volume (Chap. 17), even if the neural
correlates of mental states cannot as such be accessed by the conscious mind, there is
an argument to be made for seeing the enactment of a narrative as a method for the
mind to explore not only its own narrative intuitions but also the systemic level of its
functioning. The two descriptions of human cognition discussed in this chapter both
attempt to make the systemic nature of the brainmind available to our human,
narratively inclined form of cognition, and I am intuitively drawn towards the idea
that the more complex and extended narrative enaction engaged by Watts’s novel
results in fuller sense-making than Eagleman’s combination of description, argumen-
tation and brief parables. In her essay “Making the Cut”, N. Katherine Hayles (2000,
pp. 145, 160) has argued that narrative is the necessary counter to systems theory
precisely because it has the “loose bagginess” envisioned by Henry James—because
it is “contextual” and “polysemous” and able to go beyond “the closures that systems
theory would perform”. In contrast with the minimalist, narratively confounding
works that Bernini analyses, in this case it might be exactly the loose bagginess of
extended narrative and ﬁctional excess that allows for the fuller enactment. It thus
7

77

seems that both minimalism and excess may achieve the desired result in different
contexts.
On the other hand, it is true that narrative ﬁction in general steps into an area
where it is difﬁcult if not impossible to maintain many of the aspects of good science
writing (such as the separation of fact and invention). It is an area where the needs of
a good story may override the needs of accurate science, and where readers’ attitudes
toward the information offered is being directed by the rules of ﬁctionality. Thus I do
not suggest that popular science representations should abandon their own conven-
tions and replace them with those of science ﬁctional narratives; just that the beneﬁts
that come with enactive cognition may depend on the mixture of narrative and
ﬁctionality that is more easily available to novels than to science writing. However,
we are only just beginning to understand the potential of the enactive frame for the
analysis of narrative representation, and encountering such variety in the phenomena
it reveals—as well as contextually variable and even mutually contradictory effects
of the representational techniques involved—should not cause undue surprise.

“Together with the cognitive sciences the humanities thus encounter the
“hard problem”, or the explanatory gap between brain states and mental
states, and the question whether our scholarship should even try to grapple
with precognitive processes”: I see what you are aiming at, and it is a very
important point (i.e., “how can literature have something to say on what
happens only at the brain level?”); it is also an issue underlying my essay in
this volume. However, I am not sure that Kahnemann’s distinction is the kind
of distinction you need or are referring to. It seems to me you are pointing at a
distinction of level (mental vs. neuronal events) whereas Kahnemann is
pointing at a distinction of agency or conscious experience of an action
(thinking, moving, perceiving). Literature can easily represent what is
beyond the threshold of agency or consciousness (showing non-attentional
moments of a character who is about to get hit by a bus, for instance) but
might have some serious problem in representing what happens in the brain
at that moment; or am I getting something wrong?
MP:
I dropped Kahnemann—it was a bit of a last-minute addition to the previous
version anyway. But my point here was not so much to talk about what
literature can do, but about what literary studies can do in terms of analysing

(2008,
pp. 227, 233)”: Interesting perspective. Richard [Walsh] and I originally
started discussing that what made a particular complex system behaviour
emergent was that it was narratable—we “notice” it, conceptualise it,
because we can narrate it—e.g., ﬂocking is narratable, surely?
MP:
I think what Abbott means is that, for example, ﬂocking is describable, but
only narratable in the sense of it being a phenomenon that can be observed
and the observation could then be narrated. But it is not narratable in the
sense that the cause-and-effect relations within that behaviour could be put in
a narrative form (imagine trying to tell the story of bird A turning left and
then bird B and then . . . doesn’t work).
SS:
“An act such as that of weaving a fabric, and the act of thinking about
weaving are different, Thelen and Smith insist, and should not be expected to
be the same patterns of activity”: The physical body movements are
different, but many of the mental processes are the same (mirror neurons,
etc.), so it isn’t simply a category difference.
MP:
The idea of mirror neurons has come along after the dynamical view, and I
admit I don’t know whether it has been incorporated in some sense. But on
the other hand, the idea of mirror neurons itself (as well as mental
representations in general) has received a lot of criticism, and the point
here is to draw attention to the differences between the dynamics and the
behaviour on the one hand, and activity and intentional action on the other.
SS:
“In this view, cognition is understood to mean simply all the activities of a
biological system that can be deﬁned as information processing, including
the organismic regulation of the body and the sensorimotor coupling
between the organism and its environment”: That’s a rather peculiar weak
deﬁnition of “cognition”, literally making it synonymous with information
processing. I think I prefer Irun Cohen’s deﬁnition:
A cognitive system is one that has three properties:
* it contains internal images of its environment
* it self-organises by updating its internal images based on its
experience
* it makes decisions based on its internal state
Crucially—because decisions are based on an internal state that reﬂects
the environment—if the environment or state changes, the decisions can
change (it can learn).
MP:
The point of enactive cognition is to move towards seeing cognition as
interaction with environment without brain-internal representations. But
rather than have the full debate here, I just brought some of these points

better.
MB:
“The kind of cognition that humans practice—including intersubjective
interaction and recognition of intentional action—is seen as an extension
of, rather than a departure from, this basic kind of information exchange
between an organism and its environment (e.g., Varela, Thompson and
Rosch 1993)”: Since this is the kind of bridge/path linking complex
neuronal interaction with their mental counterpart you are (rightly) looking
for to support your argument, I would spend a couple of more lines around
the nature of this fractal hypothesis of enactivism, where small-scale and
large-scale cognition are uniﬁed under the same principles.
MP:
Agreed—I have tried to bring this up more in the current version.
SS:
“The two descriptions of human cognition discussed in this chapter both
attempt to make the systemic nature of the brainmind available to our
human, narratively inclined form of cognition, and I am intuitively drawn
towards the idea that the more complex and extended narrative enaction

combination of description, argumentation and brief parables”: I’ve read
Blindsight, yet I missed quite a lot of what you talk about here. So it was not
more sense-making for me!
MP:
On the other hand, literary works are rarely meant to be one-off ‘downloads’
of information into their readers’ minds, but instead this kind of ‘fuller’
sense-making often comes out only after repeated readings. And not
necessarily to every reader—half of this comes from my particular
brainmind having done a certain kind of work with the stuff offered to me
by the matrix of the text.

Chapter 9
Closure, Observation and Coupling: On
Narrative and Autopoiesis
Adam Lively
Abstract This chapter outlines three themes that it takes to be central to the
conception of narrative ﬁction as an autopoietic system: closure, observation and
coupling. Closure refers to the processes by which a system such as a narrative
distinguishes itself, through its own internal operations, from its environment.
Observation refers to the emergence and vicissitudes of linguistic function in the
artistic text, function being dependent on the proliferating, recursively embedded
perspectives at stake in narrative ﬁction (perspectives of readers, narrators, char-
acters). Coupling refers to the constraints that interacting autopoietic systems
impose on one another, and how this process should be understood in relation to
narrative—either in terms of interactions between reader and text, or between
broader autopoietic systems of perception and communication. These themes are
explored with reference to Aristotelian narrative theory, the functionalist semiotics
of Jan Mukařovský and the systems theory of Niklas Luhmann.

Introduction
In his Introduction to Systems Theory, Niklas Luhmann recounts a conversation in
which Humberto Maturana explained to him how he hit on the term autopoiesis for
his theory of self-reproducing systems. A philosopher colleague had been explaining
to him Aristotle’s distinction between praxis (an action that is self-sufﬁcient in the
sense of being of a certain value in itself) and poiēsis (a “making”—an action that is
intended to produce something outside itself, a “work”). “Maturana found a bridge
between the two concepts,” Luhmann writes. “He spoke of autopoiesis, a poiesis that
is its own work [. . .] the system that is its own work” (Luhmann 2013, pp. 77–78).
There is an irony here. For Maturana would come to contest Luhmann’s application
of the concept of autopoiesis to social or communicative systems. Yet poiēsis is the
title of Aristotle’s treatise on the “making” of works of art (especially dramatic

tragedy), and throughout that work he repeatedly has recourse to the analogy
between, on the one hand, the way that works of art like tragedies are constructed
and, on the other, the way that organic forms are constructed.
In this chapter, I pursue this question of how narrative ﬁction can be thought of in
autopoietic terms. This is not an approach that has yet made much impact in narrative
theory, though Luhmann (2000) has written at length on autopoiesis and the “art
system” and Bruce Clarke (2014) on the post-humanist ideological implications of
thinking about narrative in systems-theoretical ways. My intentions in relation to this
new ﬁeld, then, are modest and exploratory. I draw on three principal sources, and
identify three themes that, I suggest, should be central to a worked-through theory of
autopoiesis and narrative.1 Two of the sources I have already mentioned—ﬁrstly
Aristotle’s Poetics, his defence (against the attacks of his former teacher Plato) of the
cognitive and ethical value of the arts; and secondly, Luhmann’s account of art as a
special instance of an autopoietic “social” or “communicative” system. The third
source is the writings on aesthetics of the Czech semiotician and literary scholar Jan
Mukařovský. Mukařovský was writing in the 1930s and 1940s in the wake of the
emergence, in the linguistics of Saussure and in Russian Formalism, of perhaps the
ﬁrst modern ideas of “system” in relation to language and literature.2 Yet the “Czech
structuralism” of which he was a prominent representative took a view of “system”
quite different from that which had been presented by Saussure (and which would be
pursued by the structuralism of the French school in the 1960s). One of my concerns
is to show how Luhmann’s concepts of operative closure and autopoiesis in relation
to artworks are foreshadowed both by Mukařovský’s concept of the “contexture”
created by the “aesthetic function” and by Aristotle’s account of the internal organi-
zation of an artwork or “mimetic representation”. In all three cases, it will be noted,
narrative is understood in the context of a general aesthetic theory. Yet for all three,
as we shall see, narrative constitutes, on account of its explicitly temporal and
constructional quality, a paradigmatic case.
The connections between these three disparate sources coalesce around the three
ideas that I suggest should be central to a theory of narrative and autopoiesis.
Section 2 is on closure—or, to use terms that I explain below, the “operative closure”
by which a system distinguishes itself, through its own internal operations, from its
environment. (Here, as far as Aristotle is concerned, I am concerned in particular
with the extrapolations from the Poetics of two neo-Aristotelian narrative theorists,
Paul Ricoeur and Meir Sternberg.) From my treatment of this ﬁrst idea emerge the
key issues of perception and recursion. Section 3, on observation, takes up these
1I am writing here about narrative ﬁction—that is, narratives that distinguish themselves as “made”
in the sense of “made up”: they involve artistry and constitute works of “art”. This raises the
question of the use of narrative forms in non-artistic and non-ﬁctional contexts. There is not space in
this paper to address this question directly, but I take it that it could be handled in terms of the poly-
functionalist view of language set out in Sect. 3 of this paper.
2Luhmann acknowledges Saussure as a source for his “difference-theoretical” approach to sys-
tems—that is, the notion that the operations of social systems are based (like Saussure’s langue, or
language-system) on difference (Luhmann 2013, pp. 44–45).

themes in relation to function and what Luhmann terms “second-order” observation.
Section 4, on coupling, considers the constraints that interacting autopoietic systems
impose on one another, and how this process should be understood in relation to
narrative. Here I contrast the views of Aristotle and Mukařovský, which are rooted in
the notion of the uniﬁed subject, with that of Luhmann, according to which the
productive mutual constraints at work in narrative are those not between subject and
object (e.g., reader and text), but between autopoietic systems of perception and
communication.

Closure
Tragedy, Aristotle writes, is “an imitation [mimēsis] of an action that is complete in
itself, as a whole of some magnitude”:
Now a whole is that which has beginning, middle, and end. A beginning is that which is not
necessarily after anything else, and which has naturally something else after it; a middle is
that which is by nature after one thing and has also another after it; and an end is that which is
naturally after something itself, either as its necessary or usual consequent, and with nothing
else after it (Aristotle 1941, p. 1462 [1450b]).
Aristotle is using “action” in a particular sense here. There is a general sense of an
action as seen from the point of view of an agent—that is the things s/he does, the
actions that s/he performs. And there is the sense of an “action” as seen from a
broader, external perspective (such as that of an audience in a theatre), which
encompasses origins and consequences of which the agent may be unaware. It is
the latter sense that Aristotle is using when he refers to “an action that is complete in
itself” (Rorty 1992a, pp. 7–8). Tragedy represents this unity of an action (in this
strong sense) through its muthos, which Aristotle deﬁnes as its “organization of
events” (ē tōn pragmatōn sustasis)—or, as Paul Ricoeur parses the term sustasis in
his commentary on Aristotle’s Poetics, its “organizing the events into a system”
(Ricoeur 1984, p. 33). In Aristotle’s account, a well-constructed “complex plot”
(Sophocles’ Oedipus is his favoured example) crucially includes elements of “dis-
covery” and “reversal of fortune” for the protagonist: these elements hinge on the
disparity between the two senses of action—on the one hand, discrete actions from
the perspective of the agent, and, on the other, “whole” actions from a point of view
taking in origins and consequences.
Paul Ricoeur (1984) and Meir Sternberg (1992) have drawn from Aristotle
parallel conclusions concerning the temporality of narrative. Both have highlighted
how Aristotle’s concept of discrete events making up a single temporal whole, the
representation of a “single action” (in the strong sense), implies a simultaneity of two
different ways of experiencing the narrative—one “chronological” or “episodic”, the
other “teleological” or “conﬁgurational”. The chrono-logic of succession drives
forward from beginning to end, while the “grasping together” of teleo-logic looks
back from the end to the beginning (Ricoeur 1984, pp. 66–68). Sternberg highlights

87

how the differentiation and phasing of these two streams produces such narrative
effects as curiosity, suspense and surprise (Sternberg 1992, pp. 474–479). The
important point here about the reinterpretations of Aristotle by Ricoeur and Stern-
berg is that they share an insistence that the unity or closure of narrative cannot be
conceived purely in (mono)linear terms, in terms of the beginning- and end-points of
a single line. The non-linear differentiation outlined above, whereby actions are seen
simultaneously as causes of effects and as functions of a whole that is oriented
towards the perceiver, creates what one might term a bi- or multi-linearity in the
perception of narrative.
For Jan Mukařovský, the key term for the temporal whole of narrative is “con-
texture”. In line with the neo-Aristotelianism of Ricoeur and Sternberg, he charac-
terizes contexture in dynamic and constructional terms, as “a sequence of semantic
units (e.g., words, sentences), a sequence unalterable without a change in the whole,
in which the meaning accumulates successively” (Mukařovský 1977, p. 73). And we
ﬁnd, too, the same differentiation between two phases—a phase of linear succession
and a phase of retrospective conﬁguration from the point of view of a projected or
achieved endpoint. A narrative presents itself as a succession, but simultaneously
“the semantic intention tending toward the wholeness of the contexture accompanies
its perception from the ﬁrst word” (Mukařovský 1977, p. 74).
Mukařovský’s distinctive contribution to this discussion of narrative’s closure
lies in the way his focus on function clariﬁes two points that we see emerge from
Ricoeur’s and Sternberg’s accounts: the gearing of the temporal whole to the
perception of the reader/audience, and the generation of a recursive, non-linear
structure whereby textual elements are seen simultaneously according to different
functions. In order to appreciate this contribution, it is necessary to give a brief
account of his polyfunctionalist semiotics.3 Mukařovský constructs a typology of
linguistic functions on the basis of two distinctions. The ﬁrst is a distinction between,
on the one hand, uses of the sign that are directed immediately at reality, and, on the
other hand, uses of the sign that take the mediating role of the sign as itself the object
of the sign. The former uses are either “practical” functions, which directly interact
with reality (an instruction, for example, or an expressive cry of pain or alarm), or
“theoretical” functions, which aim to represent reality in the mind (scientiﬁc lan-
guage being a prime example). The latter uses—those which take the mediating role
of the sign as their object—are either “symbolic” functions, which have as their
object the association or mediation between the sign and reality (Mukařovský gives
the example of a national ﬂag), or “aesthetic” functions, which take as their object
the mediation between the sign and the perceiving subject. The second distinction,
which forms the basis of the sub-categories listed above, is a distinction as to
whether the language is oriented towards the subject or the object. Thus the practical
function is oriented towards its object (reality) in the sense that here the language
interacts directly with reality, seeking to change or express it, whereas in the case of
3Mukařovský was inﬂuenced by the functionalist semiotics of Karl Bühler (1990): I discuss the
signiﬁcance of this inﬂuence in the following section.
88
A. Lively

the theoretical function the language is oriented towards the subject in that it is aimed
not at changing or directly expressing reality but at constructing an image of reality
in the mind of the subject. The “symbolic” function is said to be oriented towards the
object because the mediation at stake is that between sign and object, whereas in the
case of the “aesthetic” the mediation that forms the object of the sign is, as we have
said, that between sign and perceiving subject. Mukařovský combines these distinc-
tions to form a matrix of basic functional possibilities (Mukařovský 1977,
pp. 39–45; Steiner 1977, pp. xxvii–xxix), see Table 9.1.
These possibilities and interrelations should be seen in terms of a simultaneous
polyfunctionality: “As a rule, several functions are not only potentially but actually
present in an act or creation, and among them there may be some which the agent or
creator did not think of or did not even desire. No sphere of human action or human
creation is limited to a single function. There is always a greater number of functions,
and there are tensions, variances, and balancing among them” (Mukařovský 1977,
p. 37). An innumerable variety of hierarchical interrelations between these functions
is possible—in advertising, for example, one ﬁnds a subordination of the aesthetic
function to practical functions (Mukařovský 1977, p. 32). A ﬁctional narrative will
contain language used for many different functions, belonging to any of the practi-
cal, theoretical and symbolic (or indeed aesthetic) categories set out above: but these
functions will themselves be the object of the overarching aesthetic function.
Thus the aesthetic function, for Mukařovský, involves an orientation with two
aspects. It is an orientation towards the sign itself—that is, in a work of art, towards
the whole of the work of art as a sign—but more speciﬁcally, it is an orientation
towards the subject’s response or attitude towards the sign (a response that is in
principle open-ended rather than determined by a particular relation to reality). One
might take as an example Jasper Johns’ famous Pop Art painting Stars and Stripes.
Mukařovský, as we have seen, cites a national ﬂag as being a prime example of the
symbolic function: it is geared to the identiﬁcation of the sign with a particular
portion of reality (the country, the nation, the people).4 In Johns’ painting, this
symbolic function is not erased: rather, this function becomes itself a sign that is the
object of the aesthetic function, thus orienting it towards the open-ended, indeter-
minate response of the perceiver. In general, according to Mukařovský, when the
aesthetic function is dominant—that is, in an artistic work such as a ﬁctional
narrative—subordinate functions will tend to proliferate: the aesthetic function is
characterized “by the fact that it adds a facet to the acting individual’s functional

diversity in some way” (Mukařovský 1977, p. 38). These two aspects of the aesthetic
function lead to a seemingly paradoxical situation whereby the work of art is
oriented both towards maximal closure and unity (because all the functions are
oriented towards the whole of the work of art as a sign) and simultaneously towards
maximal internal differentiation and diversiﬁcation (because the orientation is
simultaneously towards the whole of the subject’s existence).5
This relation between perception, recursion and closure is central to Luhmann’s
concept of “form”. Luhmann’s systems theory is based on a “differential or differ-
ence theoretical approach” that draws on British mathematician George Spencer-
Brown’s calculus of distinctions, presented in his book The Laws of Form (Spencer
Brown 1969). Spencer-Brown begins with an injunction: “Draw a distinction!”
(In the context of the preceding discussion of polyfunctionality, one might take the
example of a distinction between two linguistics functions.) On the “unmarked
space” of the blank sheet of paper, he marks the distinction with the form shown
in Fig. 9.1 (Spencer-Brown 1969, p. 4).
This form is a unity that is, paradoxically, also a difference—the difference
between the distinction proper (the vertical line), which has two sides, and the
indication of the distinction (the horizontal line), which marks only one side of the
distinction. The indication of a distinction is internal to the distinction and marks
only one side of a two-sided form: every distinction has an “unmarked” space that is
the choice of this (as opposed to any other) distinction: “When handling a distinc-
tion, you always have a blind spot or something invisible behind your back. You
cannot observe yourself as the one who handles the distinction. Rather you must
make yourself invisible if you want to observe” (Luhmann 2013, p. 104).6
Luhmann follows Spencer-Brown in using the term “form” for the boundary
articulated by a distinction. A form is asymmetrical because, although it has two

5Mukařovský’s argument that the aesthetic function tends to generate polyfunctionality can be
compared to Meir Sternberg’s “Proteus Principle” concerning narrative—the idea that narrative is
characterised by a many-to-many correlation between form and function (see Pianzola, Chap. 8 in
this book).
6A different formulation of the same point, from a phenomenological perspective, can be found in
Mikhail Bakhtin’s essay “Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity”, where he describes the asym-
metric relation between a self that is the unique origin of a subjectivity and a self that presents itself
as an object to that subjectivity: there will always be an “excess” of the one over the other, whereby
the “horizon” of the subjectivity exceeds that of the self that it encompasses as object (Bakhtin
1990, pp. 22–23).

sides, at any one time only one of the sides is indicated. Thus a system distinguishes
itself from its environment through its internal operations. An artwork is such a form,
for it strives towards just such a “double-closure”: “A work of art must distinguish
itself externally from other objects and events, or it will lose itself in the world.
Internally, the work closes itself off by limiting further possibilities with each of its
formal decisions” (Luhmann 2000, p. 29). Narrative is exemplary in this respect: “A
narration opens with the phrase ‘once upon a time . . .,’ which demarcates an
imaginary space for the unfolding of the narration at the exclusion of everything
else” (Luhmann 2000, p. 32). Taken as whole, “the sequence of operations closes
itself off and in doing so excludes other things” (p. 33). Luhmann invokes in this
context the same term, “contexture”, employed by Mukařovský: “Every choice of
contexture generates a surrounding space, the unmarked space of Spencer-Brown’s
formal calculus” (Luhmann 2000, p. 33).
In drawing a boundary, as we have indicated, the sequence of operations limits
itself to internal operations. These internal operations that articulate a form are
recursive, since any crossing into the unmarked space of a distinction presupposes
the original distinction: the form, in Spencer-Brown’s formulation, “reenters” the
form (Luhmann 2000, p. 139). In terms of narrative, such recursion guarantees
connectivity within the narrative and justiﬁes describing the narrative as a form of
autopoiesis, in that
the elements of the system are produced within the network of the system’s elements, that is,
through recursions. A communication cannot occur as an isolated phenomenon, as a singular
event brought about by a combination of physical, chemical, living, and psychic causes. Nor
can it proceed through simple replication, merely by substituting disappearing elements for
one another (Luhmann 2000, p. 49)7.
Thus Luhmann’s difference-theoretical approach clariﬁes at a high level of
abstraction how the sequential series of successive “distinctions” of which the
narrative is composed is simultaneously a recursive unfolding of that which is
given at the beginning—provided, that is, that one understands that “given” in
terms of the initiating articulation of a form (in Mukařovský’s terms, an orientation
of the sign to the whole of the aesthetic sign of which it is an element).
It also helps to clarify the linkage between this recursive dynamic, on the one
hand, and, on the other hand, the polyfunctionality that Mukařovský points to as the
basis of narrative’s non-linear dimension. “A function,” as Luhmann writes, “is
nothing other than a focus for comparison. It marks a problem [. . .] in such a way
that multiple solutions can be compared and that the problem remains open for
further selections and substitutions” (Luhmann 2000, p. 138). Functions are also
7In narrative ﬁction, Luhmann’s stricture concerning the “isolated phenomenon” or “singular
event” can be applied even to those features that Barthes (1986) groups together under the term
“reality effect”—that is, “realistic” details or speciﬁcations that are deliberately inconsequential to
the plot or theme: here, as Barthes points out, the apparently “singular event” authenticates the
“realism” (the “referential illusion”) of the narrative considered as a totality, as a singular, whole
aesthetic sign: these details “say nothing but this: we are the real; it is the category of ‘the real’ (and
not its contingent contents) which is then signiﬁed” (Barthes 1986, p. 148).

available, as we have seen in our earlier discussion of Mukařovský, for recursive
operations. In a narrative, an action or use of language that serves one particular
function can simultaneously serve (or can subsequently come to be seen to simul-
taneously serve) a quite different function. On the other hand, functionality emerges
from what Luhmann calls “second-order observation”:
Unlike purpose, function does not serve the orientation of ﬁrst-order observers—of the actor
himself, his advisors, or his critics. An operation needs no knowledge of its function; it can
substitute a purpose [. . .] (p. 137).
Thus the consideration of functionality raises the issue of observation (including
that of what Luhmann means here by “second-order observation). It is to this issue
that I now turn.
3
Observation
The function of art in the modern world, according to Luhmann, is to bring to
consciousness the interaction of perception and communication: in non-artistic
contexts “communication captivates perception and thereby directs awareness”,
whereas “[a]rt seeks a different kind of relationship between perception and com-
munication—one that is irritating and deﬁes normality—and just this is communi-
cated” (Luhmann 2000, p. 23). Art deals in meanings (including linguistic meaning),
but it is also something that is perceived, a “quasi-object” whose operative closure
(as we have seen in Sect. 2) distinguishes it from everything else in the world. Above
all, art is a prime example of a “second-order” observation system—a system
constituted not just by “ﬁrst-order” operations of observation and distinction-making
(as outlined in Sect. 2), but also by second-order “observations of observations”.
Before turning to Luhmann’s account of art as a second-order observation
system—and its particular application to narrative—I will draw out how versions
of its basic conceptual linkage between perception and communication can be found,
too, both in Aristotle and in Mukařovský’s concept of the aesthetic function. In
Aristotle, the key term is mimēsis.8 Aristotle’s concept of mimēsis should be
distinguished, in the ﬁrst place, from the Platonic idea that a representation is a
degenerate third-hand copy (coming after the object it represents, which itself comes
after the Ideal Form of which the object is a partial realization). Aristotle comes at the
question of representation, by contrast, from the point of view of human develop-
ment. Mimetic representation, for Aristotle, is natural to children and is one of the
primary features that distinguishes humans from animals: it both increases the scope
for learning and is inherently pleasurable (Aristotle 1941, p. 1457 [1448b]).
8Mimēsis is often given in English as “imitation”, which has somewhat belittling connotations that
don’t do justice to the key role that he saw it playing in human cognition and development. Here I
follow Stephen Halliwell (1986) in preferring the term “mimetic representation”, in which an iconic
or imitative aspect is understood.
92
A. Lively

Although it is a form of iconicity, an imitative relation whereby a similarity is
perceived between the representation and what it represents, Aristotle gives mimēsis
a surprisingly wide scope, taking in not just visual art and drama, but also dance and
even music. Written narrative is also a mimetic representation, and not just at those
points where the author (through “direct speech”) “impersonates” or “takes on” the
voice of characters: the narrative as a whole is also a mimetic representation in that in
narrating the author is “taking on” the voice a ﬁctive narrator. Aryeh Kosman’s
commentary on the Poetics provides a useful gloss on this point:
A poet [. . .] is not primarily a creator of things that imitate: it is the poet himself who is an
imitator in that she makes imitation things. It is not, in other words, that the poet is an
imitator because she creates a piece of discourse that imitates a non-discursive reality; she is
an imitator because she imitates a speaker speaking about reality, though it is not her reality,
but the reality of that ﬁctional speaker’s ﬁctional world. It is this relation between the poet
and the speaker that is the primary imitative relation. The poet creates an imitation speaker
who makes real speeches in the imitative world, ‘imaginary gardens with real toads in them’
as Marianne Moore once put it, not imaginary toads in gardens that are real (Kosman 1992,
p. 57).
Mimetic representation then is an imitative action by the author, and its reception
by the audience is similarly constructional.
An artistic representation, according to Aristotle, has the sensible qualities of an
ordinary object, but qua representation these qualities take on for the perceiver an
additional function in that they are perceived also in terms of their relation to the
object represented: it is through contemplation of this extra dimension, Aristotle
argues, that we are able to take pleasure in representations of objects distasteful in
themselves, such as a painting of a corpse (Aristotle 1941, p. 1457 [1448b]). In her
commentary on the Poetics, Elizabeth Belﬁore provides the following gloss on
theōria or “contemplation”, the term that Aristotle employs for the perception of
the mimetic, representational object:
by means of theōria we learn and reason about a representational relationship between the
imitation and the object imitated. Theōria is nonpractical. Theōria alone, Aristotle writes in
Nicomachean Ethics 10.1177b 1-4, “is loved for itself. For nothing results from it except
contemplating, but from practical things we acquire something, to a greater or lesser degree,
in addition to the action.” (Belﬁore 1992, p. 67)
Aristotle works out this relation to the experience of the contemplator in terms of
his notion of the “cathartic” response: I return to catharsis in the Sect. 4, where I
consider the role of constraint.
As we saw in Sect. 2, Mukařovský conceives the “aesthetic function” as focussed
on the open-ended perception by the reader of the sign’s contexture. But there is
another level at which Mukařovský’s functionalism integrates perception and com-
munication, which can be seen if we draw out its indebtedness to Karl Bühler’s
instrumentalist theory of language (1990/1934). Bühler’s starting point is the close
interconnection between language and perception: language, according to this view,
9

93

is a mediation, something through which things are revealed, or by means of which
(as an instrument or tool) people are guided to look at them.9 His schema of
linguistic communication presents what psychologists today would call the “joint-
attentional situation” (Tomasello 1999; Eilan et al. 2005); see Fig. 9.2.
In Fig. 9.2, the sign (indicated by the circle S) encompasses three facets or
“semantic functions”, depending on the pole of the triad to which it is oriented.
Particular instances of language-use are “phenomena of dominance, in which one of
the three fundamental relationships of the language sounds is in the foreground”
(39). To this schema Mukařovský’s aesthetic function adds another phenomenolog-
ical layer: the perception inherent in the (joint attentional) sign itself becomes an
object of perception, since everything, under the aesthetic function, is referred back
to the perception of the viewer or artist. In narrative, for example, the perception of
the manifold different ways in which language can be used—its various simulta-
neous possible functions—itself becomes, by a recursive operation, the object of
perception.
Once again, Luhmann’s difference-theoretical account of communicative sys-
tems—and in particular his concept of second-order observation—helps clarify the
recursion at stake here. For Luhmann, as we saw in Sect. 2, the act of observing

9Bühler points out that the etymology of common Indo-European words for “sign” (e.g., Zeichen
(sign), σήμα (sign), δείξις (pointing), signum, etc.) characteristically refers to “a showing (or a
revealing) of things to the viewer, or the other way round, leading the viewer (the viewing gaze) to
the things” (Bühler 1990, p. 44).

involves making a distinction in which only one side, the “marked” side, is visible in
indicating the distinction. There remains an “unmarked space”—that is, the space
from which the observer makes the distinction. “At the same time,” Luhmann
continues, “the observer—in drawing a distinction—makes himself visible to others.
He betrays his presence—even if a further distinction is required to distinguish him”
(Luhmann 2000, p. 54). In second-order observation, where one “observes an
observer”, one “pays attention to how they observe” (Luhmann 2013, p. 111) and
in doing so, in distinguishing the distinction they are making, one reveals the
unmarked space of the original distinction: “Second-order observation is observation
of an observer with a view to that which he cannot see” (p. 112). At the same time, a
second-order observation is also a ﬁrst-order observation, it is not a free-ﬂoating,
God-like omniscience: “the second-order observer remains anchored in the world
(and accordingly observable). And he sees only what he can distinguish” (Luhmann
2000, p. 56).
But it is a mistake, according to Luhmann, to think of observation merely in terms
of “subjects”. From a difference-theoretical perspective, observation is an operation
that is carried out by a communication in making a distinction: “One speaks about
something speciﬁc and thematizes what one is speaking about. Thus, one uses a
distinction; one speaks about this and nothing else” (Luhmann 2000, p. 105).
Modern societies, according to Luhmann, have developed, through their increasing
functional differentiation and complexity, “communicative systems” that are based
on this kind of second-order observation. The “art system” is only one example of
such systems: other examples he cites includes the law, science, education and
politics (Luhmann 2000, pp. 63–65; 2013, pp. 115–116). To elaborate on just one
of these examples: scientists carry out ﬁrst-order observations in their laboratories,
but the autopoiesis of the scientiﬁc system occurs at the level of second-order
observation, when these ﬁrst-order observations, mediated by publication in peer-
reviewed journals, are subjected to the scrutiny of other scientists, who are now able
to observe the mode of observation of the original scientists (Luhmann 2000, p. 63).
What distinguishes the art system from these other second-order systems is that it
produces perceptible objects or events marked by the kind of operative closure
outlined in Sect. 2. The distinct boundary, the form, marked out in each of the
recursive operations by which the artwork is constructed, presents an object for the
joint attention of artist and perceivers: the art system in general has developed “the
specialised function of orchestrating second-order observations” (p. 67) in the form
of perceptible events/objects. In narrative ﬁction the observation of observation is
particularly explicit and thematised—for in this case, as I explore further in Sect. 4,
the reader is constantly invited to observe the mimetic representation of narrators and
characters. “Narratives,” as Bruce Clarke writes, “beckon us to reconstruct their
virtual structures as the actual traces of other observers, to experience those narra-
tions as observing systems and not just as sequential semiotic structures” (Clarke
2014, p. 96).

Coupling
My starting-point was that Aristotle’s Poetics is about poiēsis—making. It is framed
as a practical guide to making tragedy (and, as a subsidiary topic, epic—a second
part of the treatise, on comedy, was lost). A large part of the book is concerned with
practical, prescriptive advice on the construction of the tragic plot (muthos), which
Aristotle regards as the most important aspect of making a tragedy. The deﬁnition of
tragedy which Aristotle gives near the beginning is highly speciﬁc:
A tragedy [. . .] is the imitation [mimēsis] of an action that is serious and also, as having
magnitude, complete in itself; in language with pleasurable accessories, each kind brought in
separately in the parts of the work; in a dramatic, not in a narrative form; with incidents
arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions (Aristotle
1941, p. 1460 [1449b]).
Thus tragedy, for Aristotle, has an end or purpose that is located in the reaction of
the audience—it is the function of tragedy to produce that particular interaction with
the audience. And “catharsis” is not merely an emotional spasm, a response to a
stimulus, but a process with important cognitive and ethical dimensions.10 Amélie
Rorty identiﬁes three sources for Aristotle’s use of the term: a medical usage,
referring to a therapeutic cleansing or purgation; a religious usage, referring to the
ritualized expression of dangerous emotions; and its use as “a cognitive term
referring to an intellectual resolution or clariﬁcation that involves directing emotions
to their appropriate intentional objects” (Rorty 1992a, b, p. 14). She goes on to put
forward a modern analogy in terms of the psychotherapeutic notion of “working
through”:
Like a therapeutic working through, catharsis occurs at the experienced sense of closure. In
recognizing and re-cognizing the real directions of their attitudes, the members of an
audience are able to feel them appropriately; and by experiencing them in their clariﬁed
and puriﬁed forms, in a ritually deﬁned and bounded setting, they are able to experience,
however brieﬂy, the kind of psychological functioning, the balance and harmony that self-
knowledge can bring to action (Rorty 1992a, b, p. 15).
The role of the Aristotelian audience is thus an enactive one in which the audience
brings to the encounter with the mimetic representation emotional responses which
have cognitive dimensions and which are also expressions of ethical or social
norms.11 It is the function of tragedy to fulﬁl the end or telos of this particular
interaction, which lies at the juncture of, on the one hand, the tragedy’s poiēsis, its
10“Aristotle conceives of the tragic emotions not as overwhelming waves of feeling, but as part of
an integrated response to the structured material of poetic drama: the framework for the experience
of these emotions is nothing other than the cognitive understanding of the mimetic representation of
human action and character” (Halliwell 1986, pp. 173–174). The “Poetics” should be read in the
context of Aristotle’s wider views about the positive role played by the emotions in cognition
(Belﬁore 1992, pp. 181–225).
11Elizabeth Belﬁore has drawn attention, in particular, to the role of the notion of philia—roughly
“kinship”, though extending to other relationships of mutual obligation and respect (Belﬁore 1992,
pp. 70–81): “Philia is of primary importance in Aristotle’s theory of tragedy. Because the individual

design and crafting, and, on the other hand, the normative emotional response of the
audience.
The relationship between poiēsis and catharsis is thus one of mutual constraint:
the tragedian is constrained by the end of catharsis to adopt a particular approach to
plot-construction, and the audience, as we have seen, is constrained by the poiēsis of
the mimetic representation to make particular actions and events the object of its
emotional response. Both sides of the interaction are systems. On the poiēsis side,
running through Aristotle’s account of the construction of tragedy is an analogy with
the way different parts and functions are co-ordinated towards a uniﬁed end in a
living organism (Belﬁore 1992, pp. 56–57). The key term here is sustasis, variously
translated as “structure”, “organization” or “system”.12 On the other side, too—the
side of the audience as opposed to the mimetic representation—we ﬁnd, rather than a
unitary, elemental response, a complex interaction of cognitive, emotional and
normative aspects.
From the perspective of twentieth-century views on art, what is striking about
Aristotle’s Poetics, what makes it distinctly “classical” in its outlook, is its insistence
on a single norm guiding the work. Jan Mukařovský’s essay “The Aesthetic Norm”
(1937) gives us, by contrast, a characteristically modern, pluralistic picture. In the art
of any period, he writes, “we can always distinguish the simultaneous activity of
several different systems of norms” (Mukařovský 1937, p. 51). Furthermore, in a
single work a “complex tangle of norms” may contend for attention, some positively
endorsed, others making their presence felt in a “negative” way, through their
deliberate and conspicuous violation (p. 52) Yet this important difference—attrib-
utable, in Luhmann’s terms, to the autopoietic internal differentiation of the modern
“art system”—should not blind us to the commonalities between, on the one hand,
Mukařovský’s view of the relationship between norm, function and system, and, on
the other hand, that of Aristotle. For Mukařovský, the signiﬁcance of a norm is that it
implements the “realization” of a function (one might say, in the terms we used in
Sect. 3, that it “observes” the function). This realization of the function is charac-
terized in Aristotelian, teleological terms, and also in terms of its operating as a
constraint:
Because such a realization [of the function] presupposes an activity tending towards a
speciﬁc goal, we must admit that the limitation by which this activity is organized has in
itself the character of energy as well (Mukařovský 1937, p. 49).
parts of the plot and the plot structure as a whole involve philia, it determines in large part the
emotional response of the audience” (p. 70).
12One of the key beneﬁts, for Aristotle, of mimetic representations is that experience of their
sustasis helps us better appreciate the systems and structures found in the natural world and in
ourselves (Belﬁore 1992, pp. 68–70). As Belﬁore summarises Aristotle’s perspective: “We under-
stand systematically, and this know ourselves, through contemplation of the natural ‘systems’
(or ‘structures’: sustēmata, sustaseis) in nature that are imitated in craft products” (Belﬁore 1992,
pp. 69–70).
9
Closure, Observation and Coupling: On Narrative and Autopoiesis
97

A norm is a limitation, a constraint, that provides “energy” for the realization of
functions—it is a “regulating energetic principle” (p. 49). It is to be distinguished
from a rule, in that it may resist codiﬁcation: the limitations it imposes may not be
expressible in words (pp. 49–50).
In Aristotle and Mukařovský, then, we ﬁnd, in embryo, the notion of a non-causal
relationship of mutual constraint between systems. But the systems here are seen in
terms of the traditional opposition of subject and object (the audience/reader on one
side, the artwork (e.g., the ﬁctional narrative) on the other), either in the form of
Aristotelian catharsis and poiēsis, or, as we saw above, of Mukařovský’s interface,
set into operation by the “aesthetic function”, between the “whole” of the aesthetic
sign and the “whole” of the subject’s existence. Luhmann goes beyond this by
supplanting the subject/object dichotomy with the “structural coupling” of percep-
tion and communication.
Luhmann adapts the notion of “structural coupling” between systems from
Humberto Maturana (Luhmann 2013, pp. 84–85). Coupling involves a reduction
of complexity, since it is highly selective with regard to the environment of the
system (p. 85). The brain, for example, is coupled with the external environment via
the “narrow bandwidth” of the sense organs, especially eye and ear (p. 86). Partic-
ularly important and productive for human beings are the constraints generated by
the coupling of consciousness and communication, both of which are autopoietic
systems, but which only occur in the form of this structural coupling (p. 86). [In this
case, Luhmann suggests, the original coupling mechanism—the “narrow band-
width” that constrains both sides—is language (p. 87).] The artwork serves the
speciﬁc function of systematically coupling consciousness (perception) and com-
munication (“psychic and social systems”):
Art makes perception available for communication, and it does so outside the standardized
forms of a language (that, for its part, is perceptible). Art cannot overcome the separation
between psychic and social systems. Both types of system remain operatively inaccessible to
each other. And this accounts for the signiﬁcance of art. Art integrates perception and
communication without merging or confusing their respective operations. Integration
means nothing more than that disparate systems operate simultaneously and constrain one
another’s freedom (Luhmann 2000, p. 48).
Art, Luhmann writes, “makes perception available for communication”, but he
could as well have written “makes communication available for perception”. In Sect.
3 I outlined how, for Aristotle, mimetic representation makes a communication
(language, for example) available for perception as an observable and reproducible
event or object (language becomes a narration). Another way putting this is that
among the objects we can perceive are (communicative) signs. But at the same time,
those signs stand for objects (Marianne Moore’s “real toads in an imaginary gar-
den”), so that (as we saw with Bühler’s joint attentional approach to language)
communication and perception are tightly coupled at this level too. We have entered
the realm of recursive second-order observation, the observation of observation,
where the “form re-enters the form”. It is in this sense, that, as we have said,
98
A. Lively

Luhmann, in his formulation, could have entered the cycle of perception and
communication at any point.13
It is through this process of mutual constraint as between perceptual and com-
municative systems (superseding the subject/object dichotomy) that “communica-
tion through art tends towards system formation and eventually differentiates a
social system of art” (Luhmann 2000, p. 49). Our concern here is how this model
can be seen to manifest itself in narrative ﬁction. Elsewhere (Lively 2014,
pp. 36–111) I have explored how the development of narrative ﬁction can be
described in terms of the affordances it offers (especially with the transitions to
written and printed forms) for a process of recursive embedding, whereby signs
standing for joint attentional communication themselves become the objects of joint
attention. In medieval tale collections (Scheherazade, Boccaccio’s Decameron,
Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales), for example, the narrator is personiﬁed and observed
(pp. 70–83). In Cervantes’ Don Quixote, narrators and characters become nodes in a
labyrinthine network of recursive joint attentional perspectives (pp. 84–99). In the
late nineteenth- and twentieth-century use of Free Indirect Discourse we ﬁnd the
development of an oscillatory cycle of perception and communication (utterance) to
evoke, at the level of discourse itself, the phenomenology of experience (Lively
2014, pp. 238–253). All these cases can be seen as recursive, autopoietic elabora-
tions (“ornaments”, to use a term of Luhmann’s (2000, p. 120)) of that original
moment of mimetic representation when the actor playing Oedipus stood before his
audience and spoke his line—when communication was perceived and perception
communicated.
5
Conclusion
This chapter has outlined three themes that I take to be central to any autopoietic
approach to narrative. In Sect. 2 I discussed narrative as a form of communication
that, through its own internal operations, closes itself off in order to present itself as
an object (a mimetic representation, in Aristotle’s terms) for perception. In Sect. 3 I
outlined how operations that produce this closure take the form of recursive obser-
vations of observations (or observations of observations of observations etc.)
whereby, as Mukařovský’s concept of “contexture” clariﬁes, the narrative consti-
tutes what one might think of as a continuously morphing but closed “state space” of
potential and actualized functions. According to this perspective, actualization of
functions (any particular path through the state space, if you will) will depend, in
Luhmann’s terms, on the constraints of an observing system such as a reader. But
13This is not to imply that there is a stable “symmetry” to the coupling of perception and
communication in art: indeed, there may be a “runaway” gearing towards perception in the art
system—hence modern art in which the demands of perception test the limits of communication
(Umberto Eco’s “open work”—e.g., James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake) (Luhmann 2000, p. 77).

this coupling itself is dependent (it is impossible to say which comes “ﬁrst”) on the
coupling whereby the narrative makes itself available simultaneously as communi-
cation and object of perception: it is this constraint that has been particularly
productive in the development of narrative ﬁction, and that has determined narrative
ﬁction’s particular fulﬁlment of Luhmann’s stipulation that “a work qualiﬁes as art
only when it employs constraints for the sake of increasing the work’s freedom in
disposing over further constraints” (Luhmann 2000, p. 35; emphasis in the original).

Looking at Narrative as a Complex System:
The Proteus Principle
Federico Pianzola
Abstract I am here proposing a strategy of consolidation for narrative studies.
Disciplines and paradigms have their own speciﬁcities, which implicitly shape
how we approach narrative phenomena. To make explicit such processes of selection
and contextualization is an act of intellectual honesty and I suggest how to do it in
three simple steps: (i) adopting a systemic perspective, (ii) distinguishing between
logical levels, (iii) employing the Proteus Principle in the formation of theories.
Narrative is seen and used in many different ways that can be conceived as systems,
i.e. considering that the properties of narrative cannot be studied in isolation but are
interconnected in a network of relations where all the components are inﬂuencing
each other.

Introduction
In every scientiﬁc inquiry deﬁnitions are important because they determine what
aspects of the deﬁned phenomenon are to be considered necessary for the phenom-
enon to occur, and which of them are to be subjected to analysis and theorization. For
instance, if we deﬁne narrative as a sequence of events, then narrative theory should
be concerned with how other aspects of the discourse and context are related to its
sequentiality. Whereas, if we base our deﬁnition on “experientiality” (Fludernik
1996; Caracciolo 2014), then matters of agentiality, perspective, perception and
cognition become relevant and crucial for the description of narrative phenomena.
Nowadays the increasing complexity and variety of narratives is challenging
narratologists to reconsider many of the concepts and tools elaborated so far, since
their applicability and descriptive power is facing serious troubles due to some
interesting changes in the semiosphere, like the popularity of transmedial narratives,
the interactivity allowed by digital media and not least the growing audience’s
awareness of the strategies used to tell a story. Here I argue that looking at narrative

as a complex system can help to grasp the richness of this domain of research and
also help to adapt to the changing landscape the most useful instruments elaborated
by narratology. My hope is to contribute to the consolidation of narrative studies
making the efforts of different researches and disciplines toward the same object of
study converge.
I want to suggest a way for interdisciplinary collaboration in narrative studies,
inspired by systems theory, but in order to do so I need to preliminarily extend
systemic thinking to the object of study itself. Therefore, before talking about
interdisciplinarity, I focus on how to deﬁne narrative in systemic terms.1
The basic assumption of the present volume is that narrative is “the semiotic
articulation of linear temporal sequence” (Walsh, Chap. 2). The premises in this
deﬁnition are that (i) all our experiences occur in a temporal dimension and (ii) time
is usually simpliﬁed in a linear model. The crucial point is that in some cases
(in narratives) we interact with this linearity articulating it in a semiotic way, i.e.,
giving meaning to it. Although Walsh does not further specify the qualities of this
semiotic articulation, I maintain that looking at narrative as a complex system means
conceiving the semiotic articulation as a non-linear phenomenon:
Deﬁnition 1. Narrativity is a property emerging from the organisation of a system constituted
by interdependent components interacting over time in non-linear ways.
More speciﬁcally, I claim that narrativity is an emergent behaviour of a system
coupled to certain contexts, i.e., a property which is only present when the scope of
the system under scrutiny is expanded to include its environment as well (Bar Yam
2004; Ryan 2007). In the case of narrative, the environment typically includes the
audience. This kind of approach is promoted by systems theory, a worldview that
shifts the emphasis of theoretical description from individual parts to the organiza-
tion of parts, conceiving the interactions and correlations between the properties of a
system not as static and constant but as dynamic processes (Bánáthy 1997).
In this volume, Merja Polvinen (Chap. 7) summarizes different ways in which
cognition has been described and the approach presented in her Sect. 4, “Enacting
Complexity”, is inspired by systems theory: “understanding the complex interplay of
brain, body, and world requires the tools and methods of nonlinear dynamical
systems theory” (Thompson and Varela 2001, p. 418). I think that narrative can be
conceived in the same terms, considering the nonlinear interactions between brain,
body, discourse and environment.
Many of the contributions in this volume deal with the problem of representing
complex systems and emergent behaviours through narrative, that is, they are
concerned with what we can do with narrative: can we use it to represent emergent
behaviour? However, in this chapter I am also focusing on what narrative is,
1In light of the interdisciplinary orientation of this volume, I am here focusing on scientiﬁc
conceptions of complexity and system. Cf. Steiner (1984, pp. 99–137) for an historical overview
of philosophical inﬂuences that led Russian formalists (especially Tynjanov) to develop a systemic
view of literature and narrative. And cf. Pier (2017) for a more recent attempt at understanding
narratology in terms of systems and complexity.

claiming that it is narrative in the ﬁrst place that is to be characterized in terms
of emergent behaviour. To say that narrativity is emergent does not directly affect
what we can achieve with it, because the two are matters concerning systems of
different scope, as I will show.
I focus in particular on how the same attitude at the base of systemic thinking is
already shaping some narrative theories. Namely, it can be found in Meir Sternberg’s
work (1992, 2010) about narrative universals (suspense, curiosity and surprise):
systemic thinking informs Sternberg’s Proteus Principle (PP), the many-to-many
correlation between forms and functions (1982), an operative rule that makes his
narrative theory radically different from the majority of other theories.
In Sect. 2 I deal with an implicit assumption of narrative theories, namely how we
select our object of research; in Sect. 3 I explain how the PP is put into work in the
formulation of theories; and in Sect. 4 I suggest how the PP can be used to compare
narrative theories of different kind and scope, granting operative interaction between
concepts, models and theories developed and used in different paradigms and
disciplines.

Theoretical Premises
2.1
What Is a Theory?
“Narratologies aren’t empirical generalizations but more or less systematized
schemes of conceptual stipulations. Such (schemes of) concepts cannot be validated
empirically; rather, they have to be evaluated with regard to criteria like, for
example, applicability, simplicity, coherence, unity, etc.” (Kindt 2009, p. 42).
With this claim Kindt is stressing that our knowledge of a phenomenon is at least
partly shaped by the framework adopted in our observations, thus throwing into
relief the rhetorical and constructive aspect of every theory. According to this view,
in formulating and evaluating a theory our attention should be directed toward how
we “systematize” and “stipulate” our knowledge of a phenomenon. As stated by
Antonio Gramsci:
what interests science is not so much the objectivity of reality but people, who elaborate
research methods, who continually rectify the material instruments that reinforce their
sensory organs and logical instruments for discrimination and veriﬁcation—that is, culture,
that is, world-view, that is, the relationship between people and reality mediated by tech-
nology (Gramsci 1975, p. 1457; quoted by Suvin 2010b, p. 88).
The PP has its roots in this kind of scientiﬁc attitude: what is required for its
adoption is a widening of focus, from the phenomenon to the role we have in its
occurrence and in its description. That is, a shift from an epistemology of represen-
tation to an epistemology of construction (von Glaserfeld 1990). What matters for
the sake of my reﬂections is the framework within which we exercise our theoretical
activity, rather than the different ontological positions that can be associated to a
10

constructivist epistemology. Namely, I am interested in understanding on which
basis we assume a theory to be correct and informative: on what ground do we say
we know what narrative is? What criteria do we use to judge the effectiveness and
accuracy of our theories? I am talking about how we map the territory of narratives,
although I am aware that the map is often mistaken for the territory (Bateson 1987,
pp. 458–461).
Formulating a theory is like mapping a territory and, in this respect, adopting a
constructivist epistemology means taking into account in our theoretical activity the
process of designing the map, be it a mental model or an explicit theory. A map is a
model produced in a relationship between the observer (a system able of cognitive
and aesthetic processes, and equipped with tools for observations) and the territory
(a system composed of many parts organized in a dynamic network of relations), it is
not a mere representation of the territory. To such extent, “theories are not true or
false but good or bad instruments for research. Reality is in principle prior to human
thought, yet it is co-created by human understanding, in a never-ending feedback”
(Suvin 2010b, p. 80). Every theory is constructed by an observer who tries to
understand and synthesize her experience, thus a theory which tries to map narrative
only on the basis of its discursive components is overcoming the role of the observer,
who is anyway always involved in the co-creation of the observed phenomena.
2.2
Narrative Organization and Narrative Structure
In this light, the phenomenon to be subjected to our theoretical activity should be a
system composed by some ‘elements’ in interaction with the environment, and thus
with the observer too. The focus of the theory then will be on the relations between
the selected elements and the environment—the discourse–audience relations2—and
on the parts–whole relations (von Bertalanffy 1968), i.e., the relations between
discursive elements and their effect on the audience’s experience of the discourse
as a whole. An example of this attitude is the following:
Deﬁnition 2. I deﬁne narrativity as the play of suspense/curiosity/surprise between
represented and communicative time (in whatever combination, whatever medium, whatever
manifest or latent form). (Sternberg 1992, p. 529)
This deﬁnition assumes the discourse’s environment to be crucial for the percep-
tion of narrativity, since suspense, curiosity or surprise are not properties of the
2I am here assuming that the audience's experience of a discourse is always situated in a certain
context, thus I use the term audience synecdochically, referring to a situated cognitive and
aesthetic experience. Moreover, I would like to specify that I am using the terms audience and
discourse—drawn from the rhetorical tradition—because I think they sound more familiar in the
context of narrative studies. However, if narrative is conceived as a mode of cognition (Hutto
2008; Herman 2013) agent and stimuli might be more adequate terms, general enough to be used
in every context, like, for instance, when I imagine a tiger jumping on my desk interrupting my
writing (cf. Caracciolo 2014, pp. 93–109).

discourse, rather they emerge in interaction with the audience, namely in those kind

Theories adopting this framework approach their object of study describing our
processes of cognition, our aesthetic experiences and our construction of knowledge,
i.e., our interactions with an ‘object,’ not the ‘structure of an object.’ What emerges
from the encounter between two entities (the system under scrutiny and the envi-
ronment, another system) is a certain kind of organization of the discursive system in
relation to a certain kind of environment; whereas the structure is the actual
conﬁguration of components by which a speciﬁc system reaches that kind of
organization (Maturana and Varela 1980, p. 77). For instance, Deﬁnition 2 speciﬁes
what the narrative organization of a system is, whereas the following deﬁnition
describes a speciﬁc kind of narrative structure:
Deﬁnition 3. A narrative (Fr. récit; Ger. Erzählung) is a representation of a possible world in
a linguistic and/or visual medium, at whose centre there are one or several protagonists of an
anthropomorphic nature who are existentially anchored in a temporal and spatial sense and
who (mostly) perform goal-directed actions (action and plot structure). (Fludernik 2009,
p. 6)
Deﬁnition 3 speciﬁes what elements a discourse must necessarily represent in
order to be identiﬁed as a narrative, hence it focuses on the structure of the discursive
system, because it lists the properties of the components and not the relations
between them. Although it is formulated by a different author, this deﬁnition could
be part of a speciﬁc actualization of the narrative organization indicated in Deﬁnition
2. That is: under certain conditions, the play of suspense/curiosity/surprise between
represented and communicative time is achieved by representing a possible world, at
whose centre there are one or several protagonists of an anthropomorphic nature who
are existentially anchored in a temporal and spatial sense and who (mostly) perform
goal-directed actions. However, according to Deﬁnition 2 this condition is not
sufﬁcient, since it does not specify either the interdependence between the system
elements or their relation to the environment.
In order to take into account the role the context and the audience play in the
co-creation of the observed phenomenon, a theory whose aim is to identify the
constitutive properties of a speciﬁc kind of system should focus on the organization
of the system, i.e., on how audience and discourse interact. To put it bluntly, the
speciﬁcity of narrative should be searched in the way the discourse–audience system
is organized.3 This is the key of the shift from an epistemology of representation to
3A similar attitude is shown by Gilbert Ryle (1949) and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1953) when they
claim that the phrase “the meaning of something” is not referential and does not pick out any object
as a meaning, it simply points out the way in which we use something (a term). The focus is upon
our relationship to the term, upon our act of relating it to a state of the world, not on the state of the
world itself. Referentiality is just one aspect of that relationship. In a similar way, a theory is just one
way of knowing what a narrative is: unavoidably it is the most relevant in academia, but in other
contexts we can claim to know what narrative is on the ground of some practice or beliefs that do not
have a conceptual form (cf. Wittgenstein 1969).
10

an epistemology of construction: the basis on which narrative is perceived/deﬁned is
a network of dynamic relations, not a group of objects or their properties. In this
light, as anticipated in Deﬁnition 1, in the present work I use the term narrativity as
indicating the degree of narrative organization of a system.
An important aspect of this kind of approach is that the distinction between
organization and structure is seen as a choice instrumental to the description of
the system, not as something intrinsic to it. That is to say, in formulating a narrative
theory we identify what is peculiar to all and only the discourse–audience interac-
tions that we usually call narratives, i.e., a speciﬁc kind of organization among all the
possible kinds of interactions between audience and discourse. Once we have that
model, we should be able to use it in the description of various phenomena in which
that speciﬁc kind of organization occurs. In other words, we should be able to
understand how that kind of organization is achieved through different structures
in different contexts: how narrativity emerges in novels, dramatic performances,
video games, oral conversations, etc. In brief, once we have a model of the system
organization we can use it to understand the structures of various systems, what we
need is just to develop an ability to perceive that organizational pattern. I say more
about this in Sect. 3.3.
When we put theories at work we should bear in mind that the distinction between
organization and structure is linked to the scope of our observations. For instance, if
we believe that some discursive elements (events, agents, storyworld, etc.) are
crucial for the narrative organization of a certain system, we are focusing on their
role as individual components of the whole discourse–audience system we are
observing, not as components of the smaller discursive system. That is to say, for
the purpose of understanding the narrativity we experience, we are deliberately
conceiving them as structural elements of the narrative organization of the
discourse-audience system, not for the role they have as structural elements of the
discourse organization alone. From this perspective, if we maintain, for instance, that
the representation of time is necessary for narrativity to emerge, then we will take
into account temporal markers (tenses, adverbs, etc.) for the role they have in
shaping the discourse–audience relations, and not for the role they have in, let’s
say, discursive cohesion. These are processes of abstractions that inevitably occur in
every theorization, and to be aware of that is of great importance in order not to
mistake the map for the territory. This is quite clear in cases like Deﬁnition 2—no
one would think that suspense, curiosity or surprise are elements immanent to the
discourse—but can be trickier if we are working with concepts like those used in
Deﬁnition 3, because we could be heuristically induced to think that some structural
elements are indeed necessary and sufﬁcient for narrative organization, whereas it
might be the case that they only occur under certain conditions, not having any direct
and linear correlation to the narrativity of the system. For instance, the spatial
anchoring to a possible world of a protagonist and her performance of goal-directed
actions also occur in argumentative and descriptive texts: e.g., Venice is in Italy, I am
writing this chapter in Venice, therefore I am writing in Italy.

2.3
Theories: Scope and Logical Types
What I am trying to underline is that for the purpose of our descriptions we
distinguish concepts of different logical type. Gregory Bateson applied Bertrand
Russell’s Theory of Logical Types to the concept of learning (Bateson 1987,
pp. 284–314) and I think it can be usefully applied to the processes of theory
formation as well. A theory is a conceptual model of how we organize our experi-
ences, and as there are different logical types of organization—systems and
sub-systems of different scope, like the experience of an event, the experience of a
narrative or the experience of a breach of the canonical (Bruner 1990)—so there are
theories of different logical type. Figure 10.1 displays how they interact in a systemic
framework.
In Fig. 10.1, different theorizations are arranged “as concentric circles to repre-
sent the idea that each successive level extends beyond the boundary of, and
includes, the previous level. Learning at ‘higher’ levels means that new premises
with a successively wider scope are involved” (Tosey et al. 2012, p. 299). In a
similar way, the choice to focus on the discourse–audience system is a premise of
wider scope than the choice to describe the components of the discourse system only.
Figure 10.1 also introduces feedback loops from each level to all of the prior
levels, and vice versa. These loops represent the central principle of recursion, which
is that causality ﬂows from cause to effect and back again, [. . .]. The diagram looks

10
Looking at Narrative as a Complex System: The Proteus Principle
107

complex, which is precisely our point; recursion involves greater complexity than,
and is more dynamic than, a linear hierarchy (p. 299).
The frame we choose for our theories is never hermetically isolated: information
of different logical types interacts and our knowledge is recursively shaped at every
level, e.g., our knowledge of the components of discourse affects our knowledge of
the discourse–audience interactions, and in turn our knowledge of those discourse–
audience interactions that we call narratives affects our perception and description of
the discourse components.
The levels are not to be considered as having actual extent: this is a model of our
activity of knowledge construction and theorization. For instance, looking at the
narrativity of a system we are imposing a certain conceptual hierarchy onto the
system, considering its narrative organization more relevant than other aspects; but if
we look at the argumentative organization of the system it might be that narrative
organization intervenes as part of the argumentation. The scope of every system is
postulated by our observation, and the distinction of logical types is “exclusively a
feature of the description and pertains to a frame of reference deﬁned by the
observer” (Maturana and Varela 1980, p. 110). In Sects. 3 and 4 I show how a
distinction between logical types is crucial both to the application of the Proteus
Principle and to my proposal for a dialogue between narrative paradigms, but now I
would like to brieﬂy clarify what are the implications of focusing on the discourse–
audience interactions.
According to Bateson, “communicators always live in a forked universe of being
both participants and observers” and “they must be able to handle the very different
perspectives that this situation engenders” (Harrier-Jones 2004, p. 150). Focusing on
the relations between audience and discourse is a way to acknowledge the impossi-
bility to transcend our role as participants that somehow co-construct the phenomena
that we observe. We formulate theories that describe ourselves as part of the system,
but distinguishing between logical types does not mean that we are taking a
privileged perspective on the phenomenon—a God’s-eye theory (Putnam 1981).
This is because we are constrained “to reﬂect on our concepts and beliefs from the
internal perspective of having to use them even as we investigate them. There is no
external point from which we can view our conceptual scheme” (Grayling 2010,
p. 771). Distinguishing between logical types and focusing on the discourse–audi-
ence system are ways to cope with these epistemological boundaries, making
explicit the scope, aim, limits and possibilities of each theory, and thus trying to
be aware of them.
In the face of this complexity, the effort of complexity science is directed toward a
normative deﬁnition of a system’s organization, in order to have a model that could
also be used for a formalised study of it. One solution proposed to do that is to deﬁne
an emergent property of a system (e.g., narrativity) as constituted in relation to a
certain scope: “Rather than just describing what emergent properties are like, our
deﬁnition prescribes the conditions whereby a property should be formally consid-
ered to be emergent” (Ryan 2007, p. 76). I now show how this choice has been
adopted in narrative studies by Meir Sternberg, even though no reference to com-
plexity science can be found in his work.

The Proteus Principle: A Pattern for Many Theories
3.1
The Proteus Principle in the Light of Systems Theory
The PP—introduced in narrative studies by Meir Sternberg (1982)—states that there
is a many-to-many correlation between forms and functions, i.e., different forms can
serve the same purpose (e.g., to be necessary for narrativity, like events are often
considered to be) and a form can serve different purposes (e.g., to participate in both
narrative and argumentative organization, like the post hoc ergo propter hoc linking
of propositions; Pier 2008). Using Maturana and Varela’s terminology: narrative
organization can be realized by many different structures, and those same structures
can also participate in other kinds of organization.
A theory describing the organization of a system does not specify the properties
of the components which realize the actual system, it only speciﬁes in which ways
the components must interact to constitute the system as a unity. Therefore, the
organization of a system is independent of the properties of its components, which
can be any, and a given kind of system can be constituted in many different ways by
many different components, as far as they organize themselves following a certain
pattern (Maturana and Varela 1980, p. 77).
Maturana and Varela’s epistemology is not too different from that of Bateson
since the concepts of structure, organization, system, context and domain are
hierarchically distinguished in a logical typology and can refer to different ‘things’
depending on the scope of our observations. Similarly, Sternberg’s terms form and
function refer to roles that can be attributed to elements of different logical type
according to the scope of the theory.4 For instance, both a represented event and a
sequence of sentences can be forms, although they concern parts of discourse of
different scope. And both generating suspense about the outcome of an event and
“ﬁnding an intentional state that mitigates or at least makes comprehensible a
deviation from a canonical cultural pattern” (Bruner 1990, pp. 49–50) can be
functions, although the respective effects concern contexts of different scope.
Form and function are not ﬁxed concepts, they are relational concepts (cf. Steiner
1984, p. 87): they can be applied to different things (elements, properties, strategies,
effects) depending on the scope of our observations and on the context to which the
object/process under scrutiny is coupled.
A systemic approach to narrative focuses on the discourse–audience system and
is ruled by the following principles:
•
depending on the context, different structures (forms) can have the function of
generating a speciﬁc kind of organization (narrativity);
4Alternative schemes of concepts where a similar logical distinction is made are: “form–device–
material” or “frame–device–form,” used respectively by the Russian Formalists and Skalin (2008,
p. 209).
10

•
narrativity is a form that can have many functions (aesthetic, cognitive, social,
educational, etc.).
Let us consider how the PP actually works in the formulation of a narrative
theory. The starting hypothesis is that narrative is the name we give to a speciﬁc kind
of relations between audience and discourse; thus, we set the scope of our theory to
the discourse–audience system. The second step is to identify the network of
relations that generate narrative organization, i.e., what interactions of the system’s
components are constitutive of narrative organization. At this point we have a basic
theory of narrative, thanks to which we should be able to identify narrative organi-
zation in every discourse–audience system we consider.
For example:
Deﬁnition 4. Narrative organization is the semiotic articulation of a linear temporal
sequence. That is, the relation the audience has with a discourse whenever they are
experiencing (giving meaning to) it with regard to its linear unfolding in time (cf. Walsh,
Chap. 2).
In this case, the discourse–audience relation is semiotic in kind, more speciﬁcally
we can talk of narrativity whenever the audience interaction with a discourse is
organized according to a linear temporal sequence and it generates meaning by
virtue of this interaction. It should be noted that, even though the linear unfolding in
time of discourse is crucial for the emergence of narrativity, nonetheless the relations
the audience develops with this linear temporal sequence are non-linear:
[a narrative’s] own dynamic production of meaning (that is, the process of its primary
articulation, but also the process of any subsequent interpretation of it) is a manifestly
non-linear process involving a geometrical proliferation of signiﬁcant relations with each
meaningful unit that is introduced (Walsh, Chap. 2).
Two things are noteworthy in such a framework: (i) the scope of the theory is
limited to a description of how the relations between system components are
organized as narrative, without requiring any subspeciﬁc property of the components
(it is not required that the discourse represent something speciﬁc, or that the audience
have a speciﬁc attitude or knowledge); (ii) the contexts and functions of narrative
organization are not speciﬁed either, acknowledging that narratives can be used with
different purposes, and allowing the theory to be tested with different sorts of
discourses. Furthermore, this kind of theory can potentially be enriched, integrated,
contextualized by various disciplines and applied to different ﬁelds of research. The
Proteus Principe can be used as a rule for the formation of theories with different
scope and can help avoiding confusion between logical types, which can hinder the
viability of a theory and possibly lead to misguiding results. Regarding (i), for
instance, if we want to specify what properties are more likely to enable the system
components to interact and generate narrative organization, then we should reduce
the scope of our theory and consider those interacting components as a system whose
organization we are then going to describe. That is to say, we have to reframe the
theory focusing on the relations between the properties of the components.

Deﬁnition 4 is an example of a narrative deﬁnition proposed for the ﬁrst time in
this book, so for the sake of clarity I am going to illustrate another theory, explicitly
developed in compliance with the Proteus Principle.
3.2
Meir Sternberg’s Narrative Theory5
Meir Sternberg’s narrative theory (1978, 1992) goes as stated in Deﬁnition 2:
Deﬁnition 2. I deﬁne narrativity as the play of suspense/curiosity/surprise between
represented and communicative time (in whatever combination, whatever medium, whatever
manifest or latent form). (1992, p. 529)
Or, in another formulation:
Deﬁnition 2bis. Narrativity lives between the processes uniquely run together by the genre:
actional and communicative, told and telling/reading sequence. This interplay between
temporalities generates the three universal effects/interests/dynamics of prospection, retro-
spection, and recognition—suspense, curiosity, and surprise, for short. (2001, p. 117;
emphasis mine)
In order to understand how it is informed by the PP let us have a look at its basic
pattern. The named system components are: represented time (actional process, told
sequence), and communicative time (telling/reading sequence). These components
are necessary but not sufﬁcient, and in fact the theory speciﬁes their reciprocal
relations, i.e., their organization: represented and communicative time interact and
such relation generates dynamics of prospection (suspense effect), retrospection
(curiosity effect), and recognition (surprise effect). This is a basic theory of narrative
informed by the Proteus Principle.
Sternberg’s theory seems more complex than the pattern I have outlined and it
might be confusing to read of components that generate effects from which
narrative organization is emerging. But the point is that organization is deﬁned
by a network of relations, not by speciﬁc elements, and relations within a system
are complex: recursive causality (feedback loops) is an operative rule within the
system itself—between components of the same logical type—just as it is operative
between systems of different logical type (Bateson 1987, pp. 411–412). Thus,
although it is true that action is represented in the discourse—and in formulating
a theory it is much easier to start from ‘objective data’—nonetheless, “the sense
comes before the surface, operationally as well as hierarchically speaking, because
it alone has the power to shape the data into the appropriate narrative design”
(Sternberg 1992, p. 520). The narrative organization of the system “is not given in
representation—much less in any predetermined form—but (re)constructed in
communication to produce the generic interplay between times” (p. 521). This
5Other scholars who showed this epistemic attitude are, for instance, Francesco Orlando (1978)
for literary theory, Darko Suvin (2010a, 1979) for theories of science ﬁction and utopia, and Nielsen
et al. (2015a, b) for ﬁctionality.

might seem a fallacious example of circular reasoning but it is not so in the
framework of a constructivist epistemology, since evidential priority is given to
the effects perceived by the observer—to our relationship to the discourse. That is
to say, the foundation of the theory lies on a pragmatic condition (Passalacqua and
Pianzola 2016; Grayling 2010).6
The Protean pattern at the core of Sternberg’s theory is that narrativity is
identiﬁed as a kind of organization, and such organization can be generated by
many different structures. That is to say, it is not speciﬁed through which means the
discourse–audience relations constitutive of narrative are generated—though in his
works Sternberg gives various accounts of the possibilities offered by rhetoric and
poetics for the achievement of narrative organization. For instance, regarding the
audience’s cognitive processes that can be involved in dynamics of recognition:
“rather than being conﬁned to any particular mental aspect or faculty singled out by
this or that aesthetic—or method of analysis—surprise freely ranges over the entire
mind brought into narrative play” (Sternberg 1992, p. 522). Overall,
[a]long with its affective force, it may therefore play on such axes of response to discourse as
the formal, the perceptual, the referential, the otherwise semantic or semanticized, the
psychic, the aesthetic, the logical, the ideological, all variously interpenetrating. Or, given
that our impressions and inferences are always in the making and can always be overtaken
along the sequence by the unpredictable, the operation of surprise cuts across the boundaries
of pattern-making, world-making, address-making, theme-and-judgment-making, and
sense-making at large. Once unsettled, for example, continuity reveals itself behind time
as discontinuity, the whole as at most a part, the univocal as ambiguous, the premise as a
problem, the established fact as an open gap covered with or in error, the ﬂat-looking agent
as a mixture or a riddle, the straight face as an ironic mask, the omnicommunicative teller as
suppressive or himself limited, ontological well-formedness as an epistemological trap and
lesson for the subject caught in it. (pp. 522–523)
And speciﬁcally with respect to the properties of discourse:
the distinctiveness of surprise relates to the manner and point of disordering, not (like
catharsis) to the matter disordered into surprise-sequence. Accordingly, it subsumes and
brings together all of the elements that make for retrospective enlightenment—for some
hidden deformation of time and understanding, with a view to their belated reformation
under the pressure of unforeseen (dis)closures. (p. 523)
Thus, for example, among the discursive elements that can cause an interplay
between represented and communicative time leading to surprise there are: motive,
character, perspective, interpersonal relations, a picture of society, the text’s entire
reality-model, deferred and piecemeal exposition, impressions made only to be
unmade or remade in the sequel, etc. (p. 523).
6I subscribe to Wittgenstein's argument (1969, §204) that the epistemic regress problem is over-
come by the assumption of transcendental conditions of experience that are reasonable—founded
upon our forms of life—not logical. We do not doubt to know what narrative is—in Wittgenstein’s
terms: we know how to use the word narrative—and this is a ground solid enough to support our
theoretical activity.

In complex systems, even with only three variables, not knowing the initial
condition of one variable can lead the system to outcomes that are unpredictable.
Imagine what this means for semiotic processes, where the most unknown variable is
the audience. The relations between discursive properties and audience attitudes that
can generate the three narrative dynamics are huge in number, since there are many
possible discursive properties and audience attitudes, and consequently the number
of possible interactions (structures) is exponentially bigger. Given such a number of
possible initial conditions it cannot be predicted with certainty which discursive
properties and audience attitudes generate the interplay between temporalities and
the narrative dynamics. Nonetheless, it surely can be explored how frequent certain
discursive properties and audience attitudes occur in the processes from which
narrative organization emerges. But how should such an enterprise be undertaken
with the purpose of enriching our activity of mapping the domain of narrative
without getting lost between all the potential structures? And without mistaking
one speciﬁc structure for the organization that deﬁnes all narratives?
3.3
How to Use the Proteus Principle
Aiming for a theory with good explanatory and predictive force, we can select the
kind of system that we are going to take into account and adjust the frame of our
theory according to our research goals. This can be done by setting a broader scope
for the observed phenomenon to which we are applying the theory, i.e., by selecting
a speciﬁc kind of context where narrative organization occurs, a corpus of discourse–
audience systems which we are going to explore. For instance, within the frame of
high-school contexts, by which means are dynamics of prospection (suspense)
usually generated? What correlations are there between the educational setting and
the emergence of suspense? Or, how can a recreational attitude affect the dynamics
of prospection in comparison to an information-seeking attitude? That is, if I have
read thousands of detective stories and in reading a new one I am obsessively
looking for the traces of the murderer’s identity, does this attitude shape the suspense
I experience (and, consequently, its narrativity)?
The same process of theory formation works the other way round, namely we can
narrow the scope of our observation, selecting a kind of discursive property and
exploring its intervention in the broader narrative organization. For example, what
role does the representation of a sequence of events have in generating suspense in
narratives?7 And of course we can shape the scope in both ways simultaneously, e.g.,
exploring the role of future tenses in narrative organization in high-school contexts.
Or more selectively: the role of future tenses in the representation of a sequence of
7As seen in Sect. 3.2, according to Sternberg, the representation of a sequence of events is only one
among many other ways for generating suspense, curiosity or surprise.
10

events in narratives produced in educational contexts by teenagers writing about
their future lives.8
This is how we can change the scope of our observations and formulate theories
of different logical type within a framework characterized by a constructivist
epistemology and by the adoption of the Proteus Principle. However, in doing so
we should bear in mind that we are framing contexts and discursive properties
always within the domain of narrative theory. That is to say, we are considering
contexts and discursive properties with respect to the processes that generate narra-
tive organization, a phenomenon emerging from interactions within a different
scope. Thus, reframing our theory we will notice the relations between certain
discursive properties inasmuch as they participate in narrative organization, and
we will tend to look for the relations occurring between narrative organization and
other elements of a set of contexts. However, it is crucial to be aware that the ‘nature’
or ‘functioning’ of none of the parts can be reduced to the kind of organization we
are exploring. E.g., in general, future tenses are not necessary for narrative organi-
zation, and narratives do not necessarily have an educational function. A similar
remark with respect to a more commonly invoked element could be: are events
necessary and sufﬁcient for narrative organization? Apparently no, but the question
is thorny and I do not have the space to address it here.9
Given a theory that identiﬁes narrative within a certain scope, theories of different
scope describe the narrative organization of the discourse–audience system under
certain conditions, namely in a subset of the domain of narrative phenomena.
However, a theory of broader scope is not more important or better than a theory
of narrower scope. The strength of a theory should be evaluated according to a
combination of various parameters: accuracy, scope, fruitfulness, consistency, sim-
plicity (Kuhn 1996) and falsiﬁability (Popper 1963). In this light, I can say that the
PP is very strong, since it displays: unity, “consist[ing] of just one problem-solving
strategy [. . .] that can be applied to a wide range of problems;” fecundity, “rais[ing]
new questions and presum[ing] those questions can be answered without giving up
its problem-solving strategies;” and allowing auxiliary hypotheses to be tested
independently (Kitcher 1982, pp. 45–48).
The PP is a strategy that can be used for every scope, inviting us to focus on the
relations between forms and functions, on what cognitive and aesthetic processes
8A similar kind of scoping was done by Gérard Genette investigating the role of the tense imparfait
in Marcel Proust's narrative, a research that brought him to readdress the issue of narrative
sequentiality and to use the concept of syllepsis for those events whose order cannot be established
(1980, p. 155).
9Is there any event in the so-called “shortest story ever written:” “For sale: baby shoes, never
worn”? (Wright 2014, p. 327). I guess this example is problematic because it requires at least Hühn's
concept of “non-event” (2016) (a baby has not worn the shoes), and reference to some cognitive
construction of hypothetical events that are not told. (A miscarriage? A stillborn baby? A shoemaker
who ran out of business?) Perhaps we can consider events necessary for narrative organization, but
we should acknowledge that events are not necessarily represented, they are constructs, whose
source is not only discourse but also imagination, past experiences, etc. Thus, events too emerge
from the audience–discourse interaction.

intervene in the discourse–audience relations. Given the complexity of the system
and of the interactions between theorizations of different scope, we cannot reduce a
theory to the description of the parts of which a system is composed, nor the
speciﬁcity of the system (the cause of its organization) is localized in some speciﬁc
part of it, rather it is distributed between the parts and emerging from their interaction
(Maturana and Varela 1980). Therefore, for every theory we are going to formulate
in the narrative domain, we should ask ourselves: within what scope is that discur-
sive element functional to narrative organization? And within what scope does
context play a determinative or partly effective role? And not: is this element
functional or is it accidental? (Bateson 1987, p. 312). For instance, we could address
the following questions: within what scope is the syntax of a language functional for
narrative organization, i.e., put constraints upon or affect the narrativity of the
system? And which is the narrower scope for which it still makes sense to consider
how culture, i.e., our commitments to beliefs, desires, social rules, etc., imposes
patterns that intervene in the constitution of our narratives?
The Proteus Principle is a pattern that can help answer these and other questions,
connecting different narrative theories and models of different scope concerning the
domain of narrative phenomena. And I think that this will facilitate our work to
enrich the map of that domain.

One Pattern for Many Theories (Looking at Narrative
Studies as a Complex System)
If we want to explore the relations between ﬁelds of research interested in narrative,
however diverse such interest may be, it would be desirable for scholars working in
different ﬁelds to be able to compare and possibly beneﬁt from insights coming from
different sources. However, in order to do so, theories need to be commensurable,
that is, we need a common ‘unit of measurement’: e.g., epistemology, theoretical
assumptions, methods of inquiry, meaning of concepts, scope of the investigated
domain (Feyerabend 1975).
Many ways can be followed in order to achieve commensurability between
theories but I argue for the adoption of a common strategy for the positioning of
each theory within the domain of narrative studies: the Proteus Principle. In foot-
notes 3 and 4 I have highlighted homologies between different theories by applying
the PP: although the terms used in each theory are different I have noted similar
kinds of relations, and similar kinds of form–function combinations. The main
reason why I am arguing in favour of the PP is that it enables commensurability
between theories while allowing us to choose other variables: ontology (realist or
constructivist) and within what scope to ontologically deﬁne individual elements;
meaning given to concepts (e.g., form can be different from or homologous with
structure); scope of inquiry (e.g., ﬁctional novels, imperfective aspect of verbs);
methods of analysis, etc. Accordingly, rather than talking of rival scientiﬁc
10
Looking at Narrative as a Complex System: The Proteus Principle
115

paradigms (Kuhn 1996) within the domain of narrative studies it would be possible
to conceive of a research programme (Lakatos 1990) that broadly focuses on the
phenomenology of narrative systems, and of many auxiliary hypotheses having
different scopes of inquiry within the domain.
In the light of the logical typology I have outlined, each research can extend its
inquiry on a single scope, spread over systems with different scope, or focus on the
coupling of the system with a speciﬁc kind of context, but, according to the Protean
pattern, concepts and theories belonging to different disciplines are commensurable
as long as they are considered with respect to the appropriate scope. For the same
reason, research methods can integrate with each other as long as they avoid conﬂicts
between logical types, like, for instance, importing a concept from another theory
and applying it to a system with different scope without considering that a change of
the systemic relations consequently changes its meaning. In this sense the PP can be
seen as a heuristic to be applied systematically for the formation, extension and
rearticulation of theories (Ballerio 2010, p. 188).
Considering a narrative theory through the lens of the PP leaves open two
directions for auxiliary theories: (i) there can be different structures that generate
narrative organization; (ii) narrative organization can be used with different func-
tions. Beside the quoted example from Sternberg other scholars showed a similar
attitude in deﬁning the topic of their researches: for instance, Fludernik (1996) and
Bortolussi and Dixon (2003) focus on the correlations between mental processes and
discursive properties, and Herman explicitly states that his research has two extents:
“at the level of persons and person–environment interactions” (Herman 2013, p. ix),
i.e., how narrative organization intervenes in discursive worldmaking and how
stories serve as means for making sense of experience. Moreover, in Herman’s
theory it is also evident how systems of different scope are linked by feedback
loops, both in the reading process and in our theoretical activity.10
In our explorations of narratives, we encounter complex networks of correspon-
dences between forms and functions, and if our efforts of comprehension are
oriented by a theoretical pattern that we can recursively apply in every analysis
and context, then it is easier to synthesise data, ask new constructive questions,
formulate hypotheses and try to build explanatory theories. In these processes, the
PP helps to bear in mind that “no amount of rigorous discourse of a given logical
type can ‘explain’ phenomena of a higher type,” and that in analysing a certain
element or relation we should be “automatically excluding from explanation phe-
nomena beyond its logical scope” (Bateson 1987, p. 300). Seeing different logical
types and understanding the scope of the concepts and theories we use will help us
understand how the mutual feedbacks between theories can be fruitful both to
conﬁrm the validity of our syntheses and to correct their ﬂaws.
So far in this section I have talked about the possible intersections between
disciplines and between theories, but what about the relations between state-of-
10But not only cognitive approaches adopt the PP: see Skalin (2008) for an example of aesthetic
perspective.

the-art narratologies and older paradigms? The PP can be a guide for a diachronic
dialogue too, since identifying on what scope a theory focuses is a precious piece of
information to orient our understanding of its commensurability with earlier theories.
And programmatically adopting the PP would make this confrontation easier in the
future.
The narrative domain keeps evolving, its boundaries are moving and new struc-
tures appear thanks to linguistic and literary experimentations, deployment of new
media, changes in cultural and cognitive affordances, etc. The contexts in which we
use narrative are different from those of a century ago, the audience keeps evolving
and so do the properties we encounter in discourse: modiﬁcations of the environment
require adaptations, and neither the structures generating narrative nor the effects
achieved in/through narrative can be packed in ﬁxed forms and moved between
contexts. Organization and its effects emerge through systemic relations. The uses of
narrative modify the context and in turn the environment (a literary tradition, the
psychoanalytic setting, marketing strategies, etc.) intervene to shape the discourse–
audience system. Narratives occur and have occurred in a wide range of contexts
across a huge time span because they adapted by changing their components and
structures, not their systemic relations: everywhere and every time narratives are able
to organize the discourse–audience relations in meaningful and effective ways.
Theories, being models of the phenomena they describe, should reﬂect such
adaptability, thus concepts and paradigms need to change in order to be considered
useful over time and across contexts. Otherwise, if changes in the environment are
too drastic and a particular structure cannot contribute to the emergence of narrative
organization anymore, then a theory describing that particular structure of the
phenomenon—rather than its organization—would lose its explanatory force.
Whole ‘narrative species’ can be exterminated in the evolution of a domain, and
so can the instruments we use to map the domain: concepts, hermeneutic strategies,
typologies, etc. More often the evolution of bodies of knowledge is not that ﬁerce
and they can co-evolve with the environment, healing themselves and achieving a
new internal consistency (Bateson 1979, p. 206). For example, the effacement of
French Structuralism does not mean that such a paradigm cannot generate theoretical
or analytical knowledge anymore, it is simply a ‘natural’ evolutionary process of the
narratological research programme in response to modiﬁcations of the narrative
domain: with the appearance of new conditions the quantity and quality of knowl-
edge generated by French Structuralism has been reshaped. Thus, we need to put it
into perspective and reconceptualize it, being aware of the scope of this paradigm.
Like Newtonian gravitation theory vis-à-vis Einstein’s relativity: classical mechan-
ics is easy to apply and allows satisfactory approximations in many circumstances,
but relativity theory has a wider scope and is more accurate, enabling us to grasp
more details of the systemic relations we observe in the domain of its applicability.
Neither a rigid conservatism nor a craving for change is healthy; an antagonism
between the two attitudes would probably be better. But, like in any scientiﬁc ﬁeld,
there is always the risk that the narratological research programme be ruled by the
‘strength’ of the competitors rather than by the strength of their theories and
arguments (Bateson 1979, p. 223). In using theories, however ﬂexible they might
10

117

be, we always employ multiple parameters for the evaluation of their strength and
such criteria may conﬂict with each other and/or with our practical goals (Goodman
and Elgin 1988, pp. 11–23). In order to overcome such difﬁculties, we should adopt
a wider perspective on the paradigms we foster, and bring our theories on a ground
where they can be tested, possibly falsiﬁed, compete with other theories and
eventually be modiﬁed for the sake of a greater explanatory force. The Proteus
Principle provides exactly that ground.

Conclusions
“We are the inheritors of categorized knowledge; therefore we inherit also a world
view that consists of parts strung together, rather than of wholes regarded through
different sets of ﬁlters” (Beer 1980, p. 63). We get so used to the perspective we
inherit that we often forget that it is only a mental habit—an interface through which
we organize knowledge—and an obsolete one, since it is an obstacle to the acknowl-
edgment of different points of view that can describe the same phenomenon in
different ways. “As long as the phenomena are integrally respected, they can be most
lawfully explained in multiple ways” (Suvin 2010b, p. 76), but pluralism does not
mean freedom from any constraint, it is also a matter of recognizing the appropri-
ateness and validity of different perspectives. Therefore, our critical skills need to be
always alert and, in order to be used properly, we need to develop an ability to see
patterns of parts–whole relationships (i.e., correlations between discursive elements/
attitudes /effects and narrative organization), so that we can confront theories and
evaluate the scope and accuracy with which they describe a phenomenon.
What is in that sense, say, the truth of the atom bomb? Depending on the categories and
interests chosen, it may (among a multitude of other possible answers) be the instantaneous
liberation of a given high quantity of energy for a destructive purpose, or the proof for a
given inter-atomic structure of matter, or, ﬁnally, the effect on the lives of hundreds of
thousands of inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The ﬁrst answer is military, the second
pertains to ‘objective’ theoretical physics [. . .] the third to the horizon of a not yet existing
humanised science. The formal difference between them is that each succeeding answer has
a larger scope: the physical one can envision the military one, but only the humanised one
may envision all of them. [. . .] We are here faced with the necessity for a dialectics between
systems and openness, in brief the necessity for open-ended systems or indeed provisional
and historical totalities. The openness is both formal and historical, it pertains to viewing a
subject(-matter) within different situations and by different appraisers with differing value-
systems. (Suvin 2010b, p. 72)
Many narratological paradigms already show a similar attitude and traces of it can
also be found in the works by the Russian Formalists and Bakhtin (Steiner 1984; Sini
2010), Jakobson and Lotman (Grishakova 2008), and in the later Barthes (van
Ooijen 2012). The need to understand the evolution of narrative studies is clearly
expressed in the theme of the 2013 ENN Conference—“Emerging Vectors of
Narratology: Toward Consolidation or Diversiﬁcation?”—subscribed to by many
scholars and perfectly epitomised in the words by Paul Dawson:
118
F. Pianzola

The most important aspect in the pursuit of consolidation is to avoid homogenizing
consensus, to attend to the speciﬁcities of individual disciplines and different objects of
study, to recognize that ‘narrative’ itself is a contingent and changing construct of speciﬁc
disciplinary methods. To clarify the distinctions and relations between narrative as mode of
thought, a social practice and a cultural artefact, before asserting that there is a common
ground between scholars across the disciplines, beyond the fact that they use the same
‘keyword’ in their abstracts for journal articles and research interests. (Dawson 2013,
p. 110).
It is from such a perspective that I am here proposing a Protean strategy of
consolidation for narrative studies. Disciplines and paradigms have their own spec-
iﬁcities, and in approaching narrative phenomena they implicitly shape them. To
make explicit such processes of selection and contextualization is an act of intellec-
tual honesty that can enhance the dialogue between scholars, and I suggest to do it in
three steps: (i) adopting a systemic perspective, (ii) making explicit the scope of our
observations, (iii) employing the Proteus Principle in the evaluation of theories.
Narrative is seen and used in many different ways that can be conceived as systems,
i.e., considering that the properties of narrative cannot be studied in isolation but are
interconnected in a network of relations where all the components are inﬂuencing
each other. We are interested in narrative, therefore it is in ﬁrst stance us as observers
using concepts, theories and instruments that modify the phenomenon that we study,
since we correlate to narrative organization all other aspects and relations of the
phenomenon. Moreover, not every property of the system has the same status with
respect to narrative: some properties intervene in narrative organization only
inasmuch as they are related to other properties, namely as sub-systems of narrative,
and distinguishing between logical types can help us to account for this complex
network of relations. The PP is the tool through which we can grasp the interactions
and build models of them. Setting narrative studies (and any semiotic analysis) free
from categorized knowledge may raise its status with respect to science.
One can analyze a situation one moment, seeking to divide it into relatively independent
claims or suggestions, and then synthesize it the next, seeking the common meaning or
signiﬁcance of the parts. Analysis and synthesis can be used as phases of recurring cycles of
inquiry rather than as static, warring orientations. (Bredo 2009, p. 440)
The scope of our inquiries can change at every observation but it is our respon-
sibility to manage perspectives and paradigms acknowledging their diversity and
limiting their applicability to what is pertinent.
Narrative studies are an evolving domain, therefore the Proteus Principle cannot
be adopted as an absolute truth but only as a working hypothesis that may or may not
turn out to be viable (von Glaserfeld 1990, p. 22). Given the magnitude of the
narrative turn and its growing trend in the last thirty years, it is probable that in the
future narrative will be a protagonist in many ﬁelds of research. In the light of
possible cooperation, the viability of the Proteus Principle for narrative studies lies in
its being ﬁt for the environment in which narrative analysis and inquiry are being
used. That is, it allows us to easily export ideas into new contexts—thus increasing
the interest in narrative studies—and can facilitate the interdisciplinary sharing of
10

ideas, which eventually feed back into the speciﬁc research ﬁelds of those involved
in the dialogue.

Narrative Experiences of History

Historical distance emerges as a complex balance that has as
much to do with the emotional or political uses of the past as
with its explanatory functions or its formal design.

Abstract This chapter considers elements at play in the establishment of our current
historical knowledge. Looking at past events as complex adaptive systems, it
demonstrates why the current mediation of history is oversimpliﬁed. By formulating
the possibility of a complex narrative matrix (environment), it explores its potential
in offering both an archive of evidence drawn from multiple agents, and presenting
the evolving relationship between them in time. This matrix aligns itself with a
simulation of a CAS, the primary interest being the VR matrix’s ability to be both an
interactive interface enabling exploration of the evidential material from different
points of access, and a construction able to reveal its procedural work; a dynamic that
elicits the creation of meaning by including the reasoning behind the chosen archival
material, the product of the process, and the process itself.

time and more, which often cross into different disciplines as testiﬁed in the Journal
of Interdisciplinary History, among others. Keen on a sense of historical distance,
scholars base their work on the idea that a genuine encounter with the past needs to
recognise its alterity to the present, but investigation can create the condition for an
objective understanding, able to offer some answers to their desire to abbreviate this
same distance. Periodisation helps the discipline to function, as it furnishes histo-
rians with ideas about periods, their characteristics qualities and offers possible
tropes of historical explanation (Jordanova 2012, p. 96). In this effort, many histo-
rians try to grasp the ‘reality’ of the past by detaching themselves from the present, as
Erwin Panofsky (1955) advocated. However, often the struggle reveals a far more
challenging adversary than distance, the openness of the past to conﬂicting narra-
tives deriving from the same set of archival material, physical items or assumptions.
This openness of the ‘before now’ to variable forms of appropriation is sustained
both by the impossibility of accessing the correspondence of the narrative to the past
and the impossibility of ﬁnding closure in an exhaustive context because the
possibility to ﬁnd another set of circumstances that gives context to the past is
always open. Historical narratives are therefore evolving and start to look into a
viable new form of exploration, understanding and explanation of the past with the
aid of new technology.
In this chapter, I look at past events as complex adaptive systems because this
angle of enquiry enables an explicative reading of the current mediation of history
that is oversimpliﬁed. Also, it permits us to consider social interactions that happened
in the past as sharing the quality of a layered network, where parallel and
interconnected decisions inﬂuence groups of actors and the synergy created, the
whole system. This kind of continuously changing interaction, based on feedback
and subject to linear and non-linear causality, reveals qualities that need to be tackled
with new narrative tools if we wish to explain them. New technologies might offer
some potential solutions in the form of game-engines employed to create narrative
systems, which open space to think about narrative matrices. Narrative matrices, as
narrative environments, would be potentially able to offer a pre-processed archive of
evidence, sources and information, which inform on what they are and the relation-
ship between them, as a start. If we grant to this hypothesis the status of the horizon on
which traces of the past are dealt with, the theoretical questions a narrative matrix
built using a game engine brings to the surface might start to ﬁnd answers in
discussing two theoretical claims on the ontological quality of such an environment.
A ﬁrst claim implies that the interaction with such an interface would enable us to
make personal choices about what is the important narrative within the system, by
exploring the evidential base and constructing a purposeful interpretation and narra-
tive reading of the event. Also, it would have an educative value in the sense that it
draws attention to the openness of the past to different narrative interpretations.
However, this claim is an already established educative practice, which accepts the
conﬁnes of narrative explanation, and can be observed in the educative employment
of games to learn. The second claim, which is central to this chapter, is that such a
narrative matrix would offer something more. It would give proof that the experience
of negotiating the archive isn’t separate from interpretation; as such narrative would
124
R. Turina

reveal the work of a process that creates meaning by including the product of the
process, the material of the process, and the process itself. And in this sense, if the
attention remains suspended in the process, there is space for an understanding of
the material, and the logic behind the creation of mythos (in the Aristotelian meaning
of plot) before it becomes crystallised into a narrative. Granting this strong claim
would open an investigative space not dissimilar to models in the sciences, where
different choices produce different results. More importantly, this reﬂective and
reﬂexive side to the process would also be indicative of the presence of a
pre-reﬂective stage where experience, the experiential dimension that the game
engine offers, might reveal how perception and emotion inﬂuence our understanding
of the sources and the construction of meaning in the making of history.
In considering narrative matrices, the chapter hopes to foster additional discus-
sion on the status of historical knowledge, on paradigms of historical understanding
and narrative solutions able to picture the complex, generative and adaptive systems
that past events are. To make the discussion as clear as possible, in the next three
sections, I cover the conceptual frame enabling the understanding of the theoretical
proposal that follows.
2
The ‘Situatedness’ of Understanding
We need to be aware that political processes affect historical practice and its
methodology, which with each ideological change becomes oriented by a different
set of assumptions, a newly deﬁned sense of distance, and a new epistemological
horizon.
Every successful revolution darkens the achievements of previous generations, and the more
successful the revolution, the more damage is done to the memory of earlier times (Phillips
2013, p. 21).
Consequently, for example, the classical historical writing was conceived as an
educative body of work for heirs of a certain rank, who had little to do with trivial day-
to-day matters and needed elevated images and life-lessons able to prepare them for
service in politics. Modernity learned to write history according to different princi-
ples, the typical and repeatable and grew wary of overarching ideals. Between these
two orientations, the Italian Renaissance offered a mixture of idealisation and atten-
tion to details, where brief historical narratives were accumulated in a list of cases able
to form patterns of instruction that educated in a comparative mode rather than in the
coherence of a single subject or story—like in the case of Machiavelli who wrote
historical accounts “to uncover the larger designs governing success and failure”
(Phillips 2013, p. 46). Accordingly, the understanding of past events is always framed
by the seeker’s purpose, social status, ideology and historical location. Similarly, our
understanding of such interpretations of events is also framed, as the objectivity we
seek is equally related to time and space. The point of view and the set of arguments
accepted in debating the objectivity of any study makes of the investigation into the
11

past an analysis of multiple social interactions that we approach from a speciﬁc angle,
and prevent us from ‘seeing’ it omnisciently. Consequently, the analysis of the social
interactions we call history presents similar issues to the analysis of complex adaptive
systems in other ﬁelds, as they defy our understanding in similar ways. For example,
social agents are enmeshed in a web of connections and survive adapting, often
navigating through the system, interacting with other agents to their own beneﬁt.
Similarly, the behaviour of many complex systems emerges from the activities of
agents that operate on their lower level, which overcome systemic changes and
manage to affect the superior levels. Complexity enters the social system also in the
necessity that social agents have to predict and react to the actions or predictions of
others, which are complicated if agents are coupled to one another due to any kind of
bond. In such situations, their interactions become nonlinear, and the social system
becomes “difﬁcult to decompose, and complexity ensues” (Miller and Page 2010,
p. 10).
Another element to consider is that each version of historical accounts, and each
political orientation of the historical practice, carries a stance in relation to narrative.
The spectrum varies according to the narrative relationship to idealisation, realism
and the account of details employed. For example, details can offer frankness and
clarity but the intensiﬁcation of their use can slip into emotionalism. Yet, intensiﬁ-
cation permitted a close look at lives never recorded before, as in the case of the
1960s’ interest in microhistory,1 which provoked a ‘realignment’ of historical inves-
tigation and engaged with a very effective exploration of personal experience in all its
particularity—but at the expense of a foreshortening of historical perspective. Con-
sequently, the historical narrative is always ‘on a mission’ because the historical
understanding guiding the narrative is impregnated by a point of view that inﬂuences
the cognitive process at work while compiling the historical account. A point of view
that even if not necessarily evident hinders the effort for a whole encompassing
objectivity. Multiple efforts have been made to address the issue by narrating the past
from different points of view. In cinema, noticeable attempts are found in ﬁlms like
Rashomon (Kurosawa 1950) or in simultaneous narratives that use split screens,
where examples include very early experimentation like Napoléon (Gance 1927).
These attempts addressed what can be considered a two-dimensional approach to the
complexity of the human experience. They look into events through the prism of
memory and the search for the truth. However, they do not tackle the effects of a
certain transmission of experience. A tridimensional approach seems to be a more
adequate proposition to the narration of past events, as it takes into consideration time
as a proliﬁc and echoing narrative space. Such narrative would account for the effects
of the transmission of the historical knowledge. For example to the generations that
followed the witnesses, considering how speciﬁc historical interpretations affected
their decisions in life. As a result, the narrative process would take into account the
evolution of affect, and the impact of contrasting interpretations when coming into
contact. Such impacts on the social system resonate on multiple levels, as explored
1See Marc Bloch (1965, 1967), and Lucien Febvre (1925, 1929).

among others by the multidisciplinary study of postmemory2 and post-memory3 in
literature and ﬁlm. Research in these ﬁelds made apparent how
Our concern with history is a concern with preformed images already imprinted on our
brains, images at which we keep staring while the truth lies elsewhere, away from it all,
somewhere as yet undiscovered (Sebald 2001, p. 72).
Thus, the narration of history needs to take into account memory’s relationship to
history, which continues to be a challenge (Kansteiner 2002, p. 184).
3
Interpretation and Priming of Past Events
The communication of experience exists in relationship to language and correspon-
dence. In the case of the past, the communication of experience involves the
recovery of traces, materiality and speciﬁcity sufﬁcient to infer a sense of corre-
spondence that, however, is not possible to access. The past is gone, and to narrate it
we mostly engage with some form of reference that reﬂects its temporal, material and
cognitive distance from us. As Hans-Georg Gadamer suggested,
Historical consciousness no longer listens sanctimoniously to the voice that reaches out from
the past, but in reﬂections on it, replaces it within the context where it took root to see the
signiﬁcance and relative value proper to it. This reﬂexive posture towards tradition is called
interpretation (1979, p. 111).
However, this engagement is guided at each attempt by our speciﬁc, actual,
immanent, question; the one reason we are looking into the past to understand it,
or to make sense of it at all. In so doing, we obtain not an objective ‘knowing’ of the
past but a ‘reading’ of the past through a speculative ﬁlter that brings our world to
it. To understand this issue, it might be useful to consider the initial challenges
ﬁlmmakers face when aiming to portray a speciﬁc historical ﬁgure or an event of
historical signiﬁcance. The most common levels of enquiry into the traces of the past
follow one or multiple of the following processes: the ﬁlmmakers collect documents
and the acts of witnesses. The ﬁlmmakers collect multiple narratives regarding the
event, which have been already put together by different narrators. The ﬁlmmakers
collect every point of view on the event by people who witnessed it, experienced the
consequences of it, and studied the event without any involvement in it. Also, the
ﬁlmmakers might discover an unknown source of knowledge and put together a
novel narrative version on the event, which was previously alien to the academic
enquiries or public discourses. Finally, the ﬁlmmakers decide where to focus their
2Postmemory is a concept established by Marianne Hirsch (2012), which is positioned within the
study of the trauma derived from the experience of the Holocaust. It is related to Eva Hoffman’s
conceptualization of the second generation as a ‘hinge generation’ (Hoffman 2004).
3Post-memory indicates an expansion of Hirsch’s concept, as in Löschnigg and Sokołowska-Paryż
(2014). It represents the study of how and why subsequent postmemory generations come back to
the representation of speciﬁc historical moments.
11

interest and produce their narrative on the event; a process not far dissimilar to the
work of scholars, which varies according to the academic rigour exercised.
Within the organisation of the traces of the past, as done by archival classiﬁcation,
news, books or ﬁlms, there is an important element to take into consideration,
priming. Relevant especially in the political debate, priming is a process in which
the media attend to some issues while ignoring others, and in so doing alter the
perception of the importance of certain events (Severin and Tankard 1997). The
‘priming effect’ is speciﬁcally important in the case of little-known history, as such
events can be cast out of any historical narration accessible to the public. Also, they
can be presented in the context of a historical narrative with a connotation able to
negate a diverse interpretation of it, because the ﬁrst description obtains the effect of
setting the event in a certain frame of understanding—and hinders further possibil-
ities to make primary in relevance a different aspect of the same event.
Priming is ‘the invisible hand’ of any historical narrative, as its effects reverberate
in time and affect each following interpretation of this event. These are either a point
of departure toward new mediations or a deepening of the same kind of understand-
ing, which focuses on bringing to the surface additional ﬁndings corroborating the
public narrative. The effect of priming on the audience is severe because the associ-
ations and cognitive patterns created by the ﬁrst set of assumptions we accept on an
event can be salient and long lasting (Bargh et al. 1996, pp. 230–244). Also, as
priming is an implicit memory effect, it inﬂuences the response to the related
stimulus. Accordingly, people are faster in deciding when a word follows an asso-
ciatively or semantically related word (Schvaneveldt and Meyer 1973, pp. 395–409)
and to these decisions can be associated speciﬁc behaviour. The behaviour differs
according to different priming, which can occur following perceptual, semantic or
conceptual stimulus repetition (Meyer et al. 1975, pp. 98–118). Scholars are not
immune to priming that occurs in their ﬁeld of studies. Academic historiography
attempts to narrate the past by confronting the effects of priming. By negotiating the
set of assumptions to follow, it tries to allow a satisfactory level of objectivity to the
representation of the events the historian put together. However, this is not an easy
task because the affect of priming is often not directly recognisable, and the way we
decide what seems objective is also the result of our mindset—as discussed above.
Consequently, to offer a narrative of a historical event, academic historiography
would ideally be able to penetrate and recognise various levels of experience,
interpretation, cultural conditioning, ideology and priming before obtaining an
understanding of the event that attempts a satisfactory level of ‘objectivity’ in
explaining it.

Multiplicity of Point of View and Complex Adaptive
Systems
As demonstrated by the French Annales school, the British neo-Marxist school
(Poirrier 2008, p. 189), and the ‘new history from below’ (Lyons 2010, Sect. 59.1),
reality and the past are ‘felt’ differently according to each person/group socio-cultural
position in time and space. As discussed, the past operated on different mind sets than
the present. The cognitive distance that divides the historian from this past is temporal
and spatial, as well as perspectival, technological, sociological. Scholarly work is also
biased by a characteristic culture of causation the scholar is ingrained in, which is
distinctively different from what would be in place in the past. Consequently, each
research in the understanding of the past is destined to go as close as possible to its
truth as the researchers’ cognitive horizon permits, and to fail in capturing an
exhaustive understanding of what is gone. This is not a negative element, as it
plays as an agent of continuous irritation able to produce more and more research.
Also, it stands as a clear indicator of our ever evolving distance from what ‘was
before’, which can guard us against attempting any grand interpretative closure that
does not take into account the situatedness of our understanding. The similarities of
past events to complex adaptive systems start to come to surface especially in the
study of the networks created by affects of priming and simultaneous, preceding or
following reactions against them. For example, negative feedback loops to speciﬁc
interpretations of a past event might make the other people sharing the interpretation
less likely to speak up, or act. In the case of positive feedback loops, they might make
others more likely to come forward and support the interpretation. In some cases, a
positive loop can hinder further expressions of support, as the way feedback loops
work is not necessarily linear. For example, heterogeneity in the understanding of an
event often coagulates around decentralised opinion leaders. Accesses to the media
vary as their commitment to establishing their interpretation of the event as ‘the truth’
varies, and they deliver it to any form of public record. Media theory offers a variety
of models to study misrepresentation, opinion leaders, inﬂuence patterns and affect.
However, the ﬂuid motion of feedback present in any social system is tough to
translate into comprehensive narratives able to portray it. Subsequently, history
often appears as a list of well-recorded micro-events building up to a major event
that the narrator tries to reconstruct. Priming and divergent interpretations of the event
are not considered, as well as the network of reciprocal feedback loops, self-feeding
narrative echoes, or decentralised narratives.
A signiﬁcant example can be found in the disputed narration of history in the
northeastern part of present-day Italy, speciﬁcally in the city of Trieste. The north-
east in Italy carries a distinct importance because the events that led to its annexation
to Italy in 1918 saw the nation united by the power of the media, which created the
cognitive environment able to promote the annexation of Trieste. Subsequently, the
event was subjected to a process of priming able to affect the following interpreta-
tions of the city’s history, and identity, to the present. Accordingly, the initial
priming favoured the acquisition of a set of assumptions on the Italianity of Trieste
11
Narrative Experiences of History and Complex Systems
129

as advocated by the wealthy Italian mercantile minority, a position that has contin-
ually been re-established during the twentieth century. As during the Cold War,
when Trieste’s location on the edge of the Iron Curtain offered to the Italian media
plenty of opportunities to proclaim the need to ‘save’ the Italian city from a
Communist-Slav invasion. Simultaneously, this cluster of assumptions negated
narrative space to events testifying to the presence of an enmeshed multi-ethnic
population and a predominantly dual culture, Italian and Slav. Priming, iteration and
deepening of a singular interpretation of events, and the negation of representative
space to other versions of historical memory created a phenomenon of ‘silenced
history’. The memory of this silenced history was retained in the city as a residual
cultural well, key to the survival of the indigenous Slovenian community. Also, it
affected the internal dynamics of the social interactions for the last 70 years, posing a
challenge to the understanding of the social network in place, as well as to the ofﬁcial
mediation of Trieste’s culture and past.
Thus, a narrative matrix able to display this complex system of social history
would have to take into account the silenced history as well. Display its affect on the
social network and the net of feedback springing from the clashes between the
ofﬁcial historical memory, Italian, and the residual historical memory denied visi-
bility, Slav. Accordingly, such a matrix would give space to a multiple-viewpoint
narration of the Italian anti-Slavism, as prompted by the actions of the Voluntary
Militia for National Security (Milizia Volontaria per la sicurezza nationale), com-
monly known as Blackshirts (Camicie nere), or Fascist Squads (Squadristi), whose
‘punitive missions’ against socialists, communists and the 300,000 Slovenians and
100,000 Croatians indigenous of the territory became frequent in Trieste after 1918.
It would take into account the ‘Fascism of the border’, as advocated by the proto-
fascist Triestine Combat league (Fascio Triestino di combattimento) from 1919,
which presents a distinctively ethnic overtone in comparison to the policies applied
in central Italy. Finally, it would give voice to the acts of public violence that
intensiﬁed on 3 April 1920 when hundreds of Slav shops, clubs, and houses were
attacked, and culminated with the Narodni Dom/National Hall of the Slovenians
being burnt down on 13 July (Hametz 2005, pp. 20–22). It would offer data on the
existence of 14,756 members of the Fascist party in Trieste, representing more than
18% of the overall membership of the movement (Bosworth 2006, pp. 153–159),
which conﬁrmed that in 1922 when Mussolini gained political power in Italy,
Fascism had already triumphed in Trieste with a clear anti-Slavic connotation
(Vinci 1998, p. 100). It would testify to the controversial aspects of the Gentile
Reform (1923), which is remembered in Italy solely on the basis of its importance in
establishing a modern educational system, but also forbade the public use of any
other language than Italian in any public places (Verginella 2008, p. 19) and closed
the Slovenian schools. Finally, it would reveal and explore the establishment of
Italian concentration camps for the Slav population, which are rarely mentioned in
any academic studies.
The historical process taken into account is an example of the fairly straightfor-
ward juxtaposition of a dominant narrative of national consolidation and of counter-
narrative, which managed to survive within the same social system that tried to
130
R. Turina

delete it. However, its apparent simplicity enables some consideration on how a
narrative matrix engaged in the explanation of the metahistory (White 1973) of
historiographical productions and receptions of these opposed discourses would
beneﬁt by the application of complex system theories. First, the feedback loops
produced by clashes between the hegemonic historical discourse and silenced resid-
ual history, within the social system, affected several generations of social actors, and
actants4 (classes of actors), causing the emergence of a variety of minor and major
changes in the system, which are not always understandable by linear causality.
Similarly, the ways each level of the system, between actors and actants, absorbed
and reacted to the imposed historical interpretation of certain events elicited a process
of interaction and mutual inﬂuences that defy conventional linear descriptions. Such
interaction seems to have been rich, as recent emergent phenomena demonstrate how
actors in the system have affected its permeability to the silenced history of the Slavs.
As of 2015, one of such phenomena is the resurfacing of historical memory regarding
artistic events memorialising a culture deeply rooted in its past. Simultaneously, the
establishment of new social venues testiﬁes to the current rising of the Slovenian
cultural power in Trieste—with at a micro level a dramatic increase in the number of
Italian children enrolling in the few Slovenian kindergartens—when Italy declares
Trieste’s population as predominantly Italian.

Virtual Reality and Narrative Engines
To clearly understand how new technologies might serve the narration of historical
events, read as complex adaptive systems, it is necessary to see how these technol-
ogies present an entirely different, but familiar on many levels, method of commu-
nication. On this occasion, I consider the narrative potential of virtual reality (VR).
As a narrative medium, VR presents characteristics that are directly related to its
interactivity, which is both dependent on time and space and to its sphere of
representation which is immersive. The concept of immersion in this section is
considered in its diversity to the experience it offers in comparison to reading a
book, where the narrative representation is mental, or other forms like cinema and
theatre, where the representation is visual. In VR, immersion is embedded in the
narrative quality of the medium, which ‘by doing’ offers the real-time experience of
circumstances, environments and conﬂicts. However, as a narrative medium, VR is
still in its infancy, as the forms and means of narrative/communication that are
distinctive to it are not clearly identiﬁed, yet. More importantly, the role and
potential of the users’ agency, which is not relegated to the position of spectators
as in the case of the audience, needs continuous exploration. This is due to the
complex relationship users experience due to interactivity, which here I consider as

An expression of the extent that, in a given series of communication exchanges, any third
(or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges
referred to even earlier transmissions (Rafaeli 1988, pp. 110–134).
If we consider such a system as a narrative environment, where multiple elements
affect each other, the users can assume the role of the authors of stories or the role of
participants in an already established mesh of plot. Consequently, the system can
interact with the users via a character-driven narrative or a plot-driven narrative.
Accordingly, the narrative can be already determined by the system, with a high level
of authoring if plot-based, or lower level if it is character-based. So far stories have
been represented in interactive environments in four general modes. The linear story
structure that mirrors cinema; the ‘tree’ story structure that employs branching story
lines able to offer multiple endings; a generative story structure where interaction
triggers the unfolding of the story; and a more universal approach where the story
elements are coded, and each decision is taken according to the availability of those
elements to the users. Early on speciﬁc attention has been given to systems focused on
character-based narrative models, where the role of the users is critical (Cavazza et al.
2001a, pp. 145–154, 2001b, pp. 156–170; Porteous et al. 2013, pp. 595–602; Szilas
and Mancini 2005, pp. 115–125), and lately it has been given to how generative
digital media is reshaping narrative (Ronfard and Szilas 2014), as there are today
models able to implement a ‘story logic’ that triggers the occurrence of certain events
according to different algorithms. These narratives could become instrumental in the
creation of interlaced narrative matrices able to explain complex systems, from which
also the explanation of history could beneﬁt.
At the present, the most powerful VR narrative engines we create are employed
for the production of commercial computer games. Some games can come close to
an implementation of some of the characteristic dynamics of complex systems.
Examples include games like SimCity (Maxis 1989) or No Man’s Sky (Hello
Games 2016). SimCity is based on research on methods of city planning. The city
emerges from the interaction of speciﬁc agents loaded with some properties and
some feedback abilities, mostly implemented by the featured independent agents. No
Man’s Sky creates planets, stars, life forms and ecosystems through random proce-
dural generation—which uses deterministic algorithms5 and a seed number6 able to
give the impression of an open system. Also, most recently the game Never Alone
(Upper One Game 2014), which uses the medium to transmit the cultural tradition of
a little represented group, the Alaska native community. Games set in historical
times are very popular, and some are used to teach history in schools, constituting a
valuable aid in learning principles of game mechanics, determinism and contin-
gency, economics, environmental issues, and periodization in history (Wainwright
2014; Lieberman 2010). In these cases, historical simulations are interpretations of
the past, which for game purposes are designed as a ‘problem space’. The player is

an agent in a physical world and needs to achieve some goals that are contextualised
in this space. The outcome of each effort to achieve a goal is shaped by a speciﬁc level
of access to resources, which vary in quality and quantity, and by constraints, as also
according to the space/time/culture and social system the game is situated in. Each
constraint, quality, and motive is translated in the metric system that conforms to the
0s and 1s by which a central processing unit (CPU) can receive orders. Consequently,
no matter how abstract the concept in the real world is, in the game it becomes a matter
of quantiﬁcation. As a result, so far historical simulations produced by games engines
are ‘teleological in their focus’ as “the quantiﬁable gameplay elements and mechanics
all, in a tightly designed game any way, factor directly into whether the player
achieves their goals” (McCall 2012).
When considering the game engines for the creation of a narrative matrix able to
offer ‘descriptions’ of complex adaptive system—here focusing on historical events
as complex, generative, social systems—central to the status of this form of expres-
sion is the epistemological framing of the ‘encounter’ with this medium. The explo-
ration of what games’ narratives are reveals that they certainly are a mode of
representation but also something entirely different, a procedural medium that
makes them subject to different modes of narration from ﬁlm and novels (Murray
1997). Firstly, they are a system of procedurals able to convey a play-rhetoric and
contributing to the player’s construction of meaning—similarly to other narrative
forms. Examples of such mechanics are found in early games: “the people have a
game called weiqi, which is a kind of ‘art of war’” (Halter 2006, p. 21). According to
the author the game functioned as a military guide. The traditional game was then
interpreted in the board game Go, known as the ‘encircling game’ and displaying the
most traditional Chinese war technique (Shotwell 2003, p. 134), which constituted an
interesting translation of traditional military philosophy and strategies into the pro-
cedural of the game. Also, the ability of games to transmit certain values, which might
clash with the hegemonic cultural power of the moment, is testiﬁed by banned games
displaying no violent or sexual content. Early examples include the board game
Monopoly (1935) that in Hungary during the Communist period was translated into
the game Economize Wisely (1960), which substituted the accumulation of capital
with politically correct goals like getting a job, an apartment, and a saving account
(DiMaggio 2001, p. 102). This development is particularly poignant as the game was
invented as an educational device by Elizabeth Magie (Economic Game Company
1904) to demonstrate how rents enrich the landlord—hence the name of the original
board game The Landlord’s Game. The game, however, became particularly popular
because it made explicit the rules of monopolistic societies and not because it was a
proof of the unfairness of the system (Orbanes 2006). Thus, values in games are
transmitted on two different levels: on the text level, where signs are interpreted in
many ways and according to the player’s cultural background; and on the ergodic
level, where the player’s performance generates new signs that are subjected to
interpretation as well. Computer game procedurals, coded by the team creating the
game, enable the paths on/between which the player can experience the game and
generate content. In some cases, as early studies in computer games demonstrate, the
values transmitted by the game’s structure can be negotiated between the players and
11

the team, like in the case of Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOG)
(Jacobson and Taylor 2003). However, in most cases, the designers, who convey
more or less intentionally a determined set of values through their games, exploit the
rhetorical potential of the computer game.
Historical simulation games are especially interesting for their procedurals
because
Simulation acts as a kind of map-in-time visually and viscerally (as the player internalises the
game’s logic) demonstrating the repercussions and interrelatedness of many different social
decisions (Friedman 1999).
The ‘authors’, in this case, the designers, select an interpretation of the past and
make it playable. The choice of a speciﬁc ‘problem space’ bonds the game to a
speciﬁc level of the portrayal of the past—not much different to a linear story where
the point of view is dictated by a person, or group, whose predicaments take place
within a speciﬁc social stratum. This limitation, however, is one of the problems
historical simulations created with game engines can solve better than other media,
as a player can ‘enter’ and ‘exit’ the lives of multiple agents and therefore acquire a
sense of their limitations, interrelationships, different goals, fears and points of view.
The problem, however, is that commercial games commit to small sets of agents and
rules, to function smoothly and to connect to every part of the system harmoniously.
Consequently, so far, they failed in offering an articulate enough representation of
any historical period.

Complex Narratives
So far complexity science has been applied only to the study of war (Solvit 2012), as a
complex adaptive system, and human communication (Corman et al. 2006), as
resonance analysis. It also seems applicable to the development of multidimensional
historical narratives with the use of game engines able to reproduce events as complex
adaptive systems (CAS) and look at the responses/reactions of different agents to
various elements in time, one of which would be priming. Such a narrative matrix
would demonstrate the pertinence of a CAS based approach and explore possibilities
in the evolution of historical studies beyond the reductionist philosophy that ﬂattens
out past events to a ﬁxed moment, whose causality is completely manageable.
If speciﬁcally applied to the study of disputed history or silenced history, as in the
example offered above, such narrative matrices of historical simulation would add
levels of investigation to the current scholarly research. Speciﬁcally, they would
offer simultaneousness, speed and access to experience and multiple points of view,
in time. Also, they would offer the chance to experience the effects of priming, the
consequences of identiﬁcation with various interpretations of events and the impact
of residual historical memory. Similarly, they could produce an arena for the study of
the metahistory of historiographical narratives. Complex narratives of such nature
need to be based on a set of notions able to offer a basic narrative theory for VR. This
134
R. Turina

would consider narrative as a process and comprehend both mimetic narratives,
based on showing (through the use of character and plot), and diegetic narratives,
based on telling (as in the Greek chorus, and oral history). The mimetic sphere of
inﬂuence would take into account recent theories of neo-Aristotelian drama (Nelson
and Mateas 2005; Cavazza and Pizzi 2006), which consider the user as a character
within the system. This would testify to the possibility immersion offers to the users,
as they can experience the constraints the historical period put on people in matters
of economic, social and ideological limits. The micro activity could be secured by
the presence of branching plot points able to offer an upgrade to the characters’
ability to cope with the environment and the events investing them, which would
also function within the advancement of the overarching historical simulation in
place. ‘Experience’ then would become the story in the micro-universe of the user, as
the result of the users’ interaction with the system would be experienced as a
personalised path of actions, which face the ‘reaction’ of the narrative system in
the person of the AI characters. In this way, the user would be exposed to the
complex system, which might present the emergence of unexpected phenomena due
to the players’ actions. The result would be a simulation open to trial, which would
secure the presence of as many limitations, by procedurals, and opportunities for
actions as possible, in a mimetic application of the historical knowledge. Accord-
ingly, it would be sensitive to the ‘human factor’ and the unexpected, able to reveal
relationships within the narrative matrix that were not necessarily visible. Conse-
quently, the Aristotelian categories would be applied but read in accordance to the
new medium; most importantly character would comprise AI characters and users;
mythos (plot) would evolve according to the action of the users but within a set of
possible events, according to the historical data. Thus, this narrative matrix would
regard character as an active narrative element but also base historical understanding
on the emotional impact of the matrix on the users. They would experience and
interpret the historical circumstances where speciﬁc events took place—according to
the users’ ability to avoid them from happening, to elicit their passing, or producing
different events. Such an experience would be possible only if a good level of
believability would be put in place, as underlined in research on virtual worlds and
interactions has established (Magnenat-Thalmann et al. 2005, pp. 2–9; Alkawaz
et al. 2015, pp. 1–10).
To narrate within this kind of environment, we would accept the narrative matrix
as a summing up of more than the system’s parts, where by understanding the
behaviour of the individual actors, and actants, we would not be able to understand
the system as a whole. For example, by understanding and following the activity of
Trieste’s average citizen between 1915 and 1918, it would be impossible to under-
stand how a small number of wealthy mercantile people assured its annexation to
Italy, when the vast majority of its population was both not Italian and not interested
in being part of Italy (Purini 2010). However, by observing the loops of feedback
and emergence produced within the system, we would be able to explore the status of
our historical knowledge. Accordingly, such a complex narrative system would take
into account the initial dominant priming and the whole interpretative spectrum that
evolved from this initial set of assumptions. In such a system, the possibility to
11

135

translate truthfully some aspect of the micro-processes operating in it is open, as is
the experimentation on the history of the matrix, because the history of the evolution
of the system itself would be responsible for its reactions. Finally, this narrative
matrix would be of interest in the study of the delicate equilibrium offered by the
actors’ response to information available to them locally and their ignorance of the
system as a whole.
Thinking of a possible graphic representation of such a narrative matrix, I
conceive of a narrative system able to produce a multiplicity of access, where the
users would try to reach the truth about the event. Consequently, stories would
function as an experience of both ‘moments’ in the production of multiple discourses
on the same event, and as receptions that each interpretation receives in time by the
interested public, actors and actants, in a ﬂow of feedback loop. The offered graphic
(Fig. 11.1) presents a map of the possible system on a micro level, where the story
inhabited by the player would partake in the discourse related to the event. The story
would ideally share in the understanding of the event, and the user would try to reach
truth and understanding beyond the layers of interpretation following the priming
effect, but it is not a pre-requisite of the system as such an accomplishment is
unlikely to happen. Understanding would remain locked to the cognitive ability of
the seeker, as discussed in the previous sections.
However, a variety of experiences offered by multiple points of entrance into the
event, reactions to priming, and related subsequent interpretations, and the narration
of the metahistory of the historical representation would be speciﬁcally important, as
their complex multiplicity can bring to surface a space where the networks of
activities can be perceived as a whole. Also, as a tool for the academic research, it
Fig. 11.1 Complex narrative as network of discourses
136
R. Turina

could indicate relationships between activity and past actions/expressions, like the
resurgence of historical memory. If applied, for example, it could indicate links
between actants able to explain the current Slovenian cultural resurgence in Trieste,
because the system could show how silenced history affected the descendants of
speciﬁc actors, induced them to adapt and survive in unsuspected ways, and inﬂu-
ence the system.
To implement such a matrix, procedurals could be used to reveal an identity,
situatedness, a discourse, and priming politics. A vast multiplicity of playable agents
could account for the heterogeneous list of agents surviving in a social CAS.
Similarly, on another level of diegetic enquiry, users could ﬁnd insight into why
and how certain historians interpreted one event by preferring a certain set of
evidence over another—translating and unveiling the long term social effects of
priming, as Fig. 11.2 simpliﬁes.
As a result, a different set of roles and goals would offer a different experience,
maybe eliciting a desire to ‘enter’ the system and experience it from different
perspectives. I can see how such a laborious system of interrelated levels of activity
in which to plant elements would offer a venue for the utilisation of game engines for
multiple scientiﬁc purposes—one of which could serve academic historiography.

Conclusions
This chapter has considered elements at play in the establishment of our current
historical knowledge. Looking at the past events as complex adaptive systems, it
demonstrated why the current mediation of history could be felt as oversimpliﬁed.
By the continuously changing interactions in human society, fed by feedback and
subject to linear and non-linear causality, I have considered the qualities that need to
be tackled within new narrative tools for the explanation of historical events. By
focusing on VR, I debated the value of new technologies, which might show
applicable solutions to a new concept of historical narrative, speciﬁcally in media
operating on game-engines. By formulating the possibility of a narrative matrix, as
narrative environment, I considered its potential in offering a pre-processed archive
of evidence, which informs on what they are and the relationship between them.
However, I read this pre-processed archive as a simulation of a CAS, where the
narrative matrix should bring to the surface answers about the ontological quality of
such an environment in relationship to the historical event looked at in time and
space. The primary interest being, the matrix’s ability to be not only an interactive
interface enabling the exploration of the evidential material and the construction of
individual interpretation and narrative of the historical event—which nonetheless
would enable personal choices about what is the important narrative within the
system. The matrix should draw attention to the openness of the past to different
narrative interpretations by giving proofs of how the experience of negotiating the
archive isn’t separate from interpretation itself, and how it changes in time. The
narrative medium would reveal the work of a process that creates meaning by
including the product of the process, the material of the process, and the process
itself. This would involve the creation of a complicated narrative matrix able to offer
multiple points of entry into the system. However, such a narrative environment
would be of high value in suspending the attention to a pre-narrative stage, giving
space to experiencing conﬂicts and ideological acculturations, social interactions and
inﬂuences from different points of view, times and ideological positions. Thus, it
would offer a space for an understanding of the material, and the logic behind the
creation of historical mythos before it becomes crystalized into a given narrative.
This kind of knowledge would share characteristics of the knowledge acquired by
‘doing’ and ‘living’, which in the case of historical explanation bears a value.
Accordingly, game engines could constitute the technology enabling such compli-
cated computational models to create ‘history-labs on the desk’. They could play
patterns of behaviours, and go deep into issues surrendering speciﬁc agents; they
could offer narrative experiences able not only to make us observe the emergence of
the historical event, but to viscerally learn how multiple simultaneous processes
could have made ‘it’ happen. Also, we could do more. We could experiment. This
would be the place where the ‘openness of the past’ to multiple interpretations would
be activated by the intention to put the system out of balance and see how the
system’s reaction might reveal internal laws, inﬂuences or relationships.
138
R. Turina

Finally, it has to be noticed that this would not be a perfect representation of the
past event; the impossibility of accessing the correspondence of the narrative to the
past would still be looming over the matrix. However, such a system could reduce
the level, or the connotation, of the problem. Similarly, it would be a historical
narrative ‘on a mission’, as we would clearly look for certain answers, built it out of a
speciﬁc selection of historical sources we consider objective and exhaustive. There is
no escape from the situatedness of the historical understanding. Powerful engines
processing the procedurals of the narrative matrix could open new angles of inves-
tigation in the metahistory of reception, interpretation and effect. It would be as if
‘traveling in time’ with insight on each sub-level of the system. The irritating feeling
remains present, as in so doing we would obtain not a ‘knowing’ of the past but
another ‘reading’ of some aspects of it, mediated by our technological framework
and limited speculative understanding. Yet, everything is impossible until it is done.

To Adam, on “Closure, Observation and Coupling”
FP:
Adam, you showed how Aristotle, Luhmann and Mukařovský in their theories
are paying attention to three issues: the function of narrative (aesthetic,
reﬂective), the distinctness of narrative (operative closure) and the coupling
of narrative (its relation to the environment). That is: what a system does; what
are the operations that enable it to do so; and in what conditions it operates and
achieves its functions. I think this way of approaching narrative is very
important for the soundness of every theory.
But you also showed how to conceive of narrative in autopoietic terms. I
just have a remark to make about the concept of “operative closure.” That’s the
way in which a system differentiates itself from the environment, i.e., through
its own internal operations. Well, a discourse in itself doesn’t have any internal
operation, it can only be operated by a semiotic agent (person, or even
machine; cf. Winﬁeld, Chap. 4). Thus, I think operative closure pertains to
the discourse-audience system. A discourse is not a complex system in itself
because it exists only in relation to a semiotic agent. For instance, a garden
comes into being thanks to the interaction of a gardener with the environment,

but then it can live and change beyond such interactions (cf. Caves and Melo,
Chap. 13). On the contrary, a discourse exists only when it is perceived by a
semiotic agent, that is, when discourse and agent interact. What do you think?
AL:
This is a pivotal question. The answer that Niklas Luhmann would give is that
discourses do indeed constitute autopoietic systems: indeed, when he talks of
autopoietic “social systems” he means systems of discourse. As he discusses in
his Introduction to Systems Theory, this marks the parting of the ways between
him and Maturana, for whom autopoietic systems are by deﬁnition biological.
For Luhmann, there are biological systems, such as consciousness or
perception, but there are also systems of communication that share the same
systemic characteristics as these biological systems. It is true—as you point out,
and as Luhmann acknowledges—that there can be no communication without
consciousness: a discursive system has to have a biological realization. But at
the same time, there can arguably be no consciousness without (some form of)
communication: the two kinds of system are in a relationship of “structural
coupling.” (In Art as a Social System Luhmann characterises the artwork
(of which, as I explain in my chapter, narrative forms something of
paradigmatic instance) as a quasi-object whose purpose is a particular
synchronization of perception and communication.) While one may, of
course, continue to talk, at the level of personhood, of the “response” of the
individual reader to the text, Luhmann’s systems theory—admittedly radical in
its scope—offers a way of thinking of such interactions in terms of the coupling
and constraints operating between systems (biological or discursive). The
radical thought is that our conventional ideas of perception and what
constitutes a “subject” obscure the manner in which it is systems that observe
each other—indeed, a system is only a system from the point of view of another
system. (Is there a sense in which a text “observes” its reader just as much as the
reader observes the text?!)

To Federico, on “The Proteus Principle”
RT:
Federico, you speak of “consolidation of narrative studies.” Can a
consolidation leave space for a certain freedom? Your chapter supports the
Proteus Principle, can any consolidation leave space for the exercise of such a
principle?
FP:
With the term “consolidation” I mean a deeper awareness of what each theory
and model do in their description of narrative, and also an awareness of the
epistemological ground on which each theory is based. Such awareness can
help us better understand how we can combine theories or whether we can
transfer them to a ﬁeld that is different from the one in which they originated,
like applying Labov’s sociolinguistic model to the study of written ﬁction.
Yes, there is space for freedom, since every discipline will continue to pursue
its own research interests. Working for a consolidation means ﬁnding a way
144
A. Lively et al.

to avoid superﬁcial analogies between disciplines, which “are useless in
science and harmful in their practical consequences” (von Bertalanffy 1950,
p. 142).
The PP is the strategy I suggest to use with the aim of consolidation. It
doesn’t mean that we all have to do theory in the same way: e.g., among other
things, psychology will be interested in how narrative intervenes in the
construction of our identity, whereas unnatural narratology will be interested
in describing how a narrator can represent the thoughts of a zombie. But we
can use the PP to see whether any anti-mimetic “unnatural” narrative strategy
can be used in a personal narrative and how it can affect the construction of our
identity.
RT:
Thank you, Federico. I can see how your interest in consolidation could be a
valuable solution to misunderstandings caused by those superﬁcial analogies
you refer to. Also, it would be interesting to apply such a model to the idea of
a narrative matrix I refer to. To know, exactly, the epistemological ground on
which each narrative is based seems to be an essential part of my proposed
approach to the study and interpretation of history and metahistory.
AL:
Federico, you present two complementary arguments, both of which are highly
pertinent to the question of the relation between narrative and systems theory.
The ﬁrst of these concerns the scope of narrative analysis, and here you draw a
distinction between, on the one hand, purely discursive elements (“structure”),
and, on the other hand, the systemic interaction between discourse and audience
(narrative “organization”). In the second part of the essay, you argue that Meir
Sternberg’s “Proteus Principle” (which ﬁnds in narrative a many-to-many
correlation between form and function) constitutes an important starting-point
for a systems-based narrative theory.
While expressed in different terms, this second argument is congruent, I
think, with the polyfunctionalism that, as I discussed in my chapter, one ﬁnds
in the work of Jan Mukařovský (and which is taken up subsequently by
Wolfgang Iser in The Act of Reading).
FP:
You are right about the congruence of the PP and polyfunctionality. Sternberg
is not the ﬁrst narratologue to adopt a kind of systems thinking: if we go back
to Russian Formalism, there we ﬁnd a conception of the work of art as a
complex system: “Literature is a speech construction perceived precisely qua
construction, i.e., literature is a dynamic speech construction” (Tynjanov
1929, quoted by Steiner 1984, p. 104). And “the unity of a work is not a
closed symmetrical whole but an unfolding dynamic integrity; among its
elements stands not the static sign of equation and addition, but always the
dynamic sign of correlation and integration” (Tynjanov 1924, quoted by
Steiner 1984, p. 116). Of course you mentioned Iser, who said that “effects
and responses are properties neither of the text nor of the reader; the text
represents a potential effect that is realized in the reading process” (Iser 1978,
p. ix).
12
Three-Way Dialogue (Closure, Proteus, History)
145

AL:
I’d like to focus on the distinction between “structure” and “organization,”
because it seems to me that the making of this distinction raises some
interesting and problematic questions (which echo, perhaps, long-standing
debates both within narratology and, more generally in literary criticism and
history, between textualist and contextualist, or “intrinsic” and “extrinsic,”
approaches). The question is whether, and if so how, a distinction can be
drawn between the two scopes—on the one hand, the realm of the purely
discursive or textual, and, on the other, the realm of the text–audience
interaction.
The difﬁculties involved in making this distinction are highlighted in the
second paragraph of Sect. 3.3 (“How to use the Proteus Principle”), where
you discuss the process of “selecting a kind of discursive property and
exploring its intervention in the broader narrative organization.” As an
example of this process, you cite the investigation of “[the] role [that] the
representation of a sequence of events [has] in generating suspense in
narratives.” But as cognitive narratology has shown us, the representation
of a sequence of events is never a purely textual phenomenon, but invokes
mental constructions, through the enaction of “frames” or “scripts.” Even at
the seemingly most “structural” level of grammatical cohesion, as Ronald
Langacker has demonstrated, different constructions invoke the enaction of
different imagistic schemata.
FP:
I think I’ve chosen a misleading example to show the structure/organization
distinction. These concepts do not have different scope. Let me quote directly
from Maturana and Varela in order to make it clear: “The organization of a
machine (or system) does not specify the properties of the components which
realize the machine as a concrete system, it only speciﬁes the relations which
these must generate to constitute the machine or system as a unity. Therefore,
the organization of a machine is independent of the properties of its
components which can be any, and a given machine can be realized in
many different manners by many different kinds of components. In other
words, [. . .] a given machine can be realized by many different structures”
(1980, p. 77). However, I am aware that in the case of narrative, it makes
sense to talk about structure as a set of discursive elements or properties,
because these are the variables we can better observe and describe. Only in
some cases have extra-discursive elements been taken into account as
constitutive elements of the narrative: e.g., the role of intertextuality and the
historical context in the progression of a covert plot described by Dan Shen
(2014), or the role of the repertoire in Iser’s theory (1978).
AL:
Alternatively, one might question the structure/organization distinction from
a quite different, post-structuralist perspective. From this perspective, the
important point is that any manifestation of the interaction between
discourse and audience (any interpretation or reading) will take the form of
more discourse, more “text,” and this new text is generated by discursive
systems transcending any putative origin in the subject (“audience”/“reader”/
146
A. Lively et al.

“interpreter”) just as much as is the original text: the distinction between
subject and object cannot hold. Here one could note the congruence
(acknowledged

Luhmann
himself)
between,
on
the
one
hand,
Luhmann’s radical application of autopoietic systems theory to social and
discursive systems, and, on the other hand, Derrida’s “grammatology.”
So the problem is: How does one make distinctions between, on the one
hand, what is “intrinsic” to the text, and, on the other, what pertains to the
interaction with the audience, without falling into precisely the kind of
subject–object paradigm that is brought into question by systems theory?
FP:
The discourse–audience interactions do not generate more discourse, more
text, because in principle there is no discourse prior to the interaction of some
‘linguistic material’ with an agent capable of semiotic processes. However,
this doesn’t mean that the subject is the origin of the discourse, there is no
deterministic or linear causality in this, it is only the encounter between a
stimulus and an agent that can originate the emergence of a certain discursive
organization. The point is that the discourse is constituted in this process of
emergent organization. It is in this sense that I can accept the claim that
“discursive systems transcend any putative origin in the subject.”
Furthermore, I’d like to specify that the discourse–audience interactions
are not just interpretations or readings of the discourse: as I just said, they are
constitutive of the discourse. This is called autopoiesis, but I avoided the term
because I think it’s very difﬁcult to grasp and to describe it correctly. I
decided to use the subject–object (audience–discourse) distinction in an
attempt to make systems theory more understandable for those not familiar
with it, but I am aware that this might not be the best choice. After all, this is
just the beginning of this line of research and much can be improved.

To Romana, on “Narrative Experiences of History
and Complex Systems”
FP:
Romana, you introduce the terms “narrative matrix” and “narrative system,”
which seems to be a sort of stage previous to the composition of a narrative.
Do they pre-exist the narrative? If so, how are they composed? Or are they
constructed with data deriving from narratives?
RT:
I can see a stage of pre-narrative in which the structure is determined to offer
space for multiple narratives, to be organised in layers of relational inﬂuence
and borderline zones, where there is space for the evolution of content. To
compose a matrix, the purpose of the narrative has to be clear: the function the
narrative has and the audience it means to address. Similar to each narrative
utterance, the matrix exists to fulﬁl its function. The same historical event
could be narrated on the basis of different matrices. However, the ultimate
matrix, the one I refer to in the chapter, is able to offer a view on multiple
constructs, each serving a speciﬁc narrative function related to one historical
12
Three-Way Dialogue (Closure, Proteus, History)
147

event. If the construction of the narrative has to be derived from the available
data—archival and acts of witness. In this matrix, the collection of data goes
beyond this level of interest and maps also the different interpretations—and
the functions they served—throughout the ages, effectively offering a meta-
history of the history we try to observe via the intergenerational relationships
of the agents at play. Not to forget that these narratives cannot escape the
imprint of their time, as every narrative system is the result of the time and
location it is built in. I consider this interesting as well, and clearly useful to
remember, go back to, and use for additional elaborations of historical
matrices, in time.
FP:
What is a narrative system?
RT:
This question can be address on multiple levels. We can build narrative
systems in different media, which might address different needs and
purposes. The matrix I have in mind, ideally, would function utilising
multiple media and use the speciﬁc quality of each medium to offer insight
into history on multiple levels, one of which is self-reﬂection on the
relationship in time between media and history. Again, a narrative system
would be highly inﬂuenced by the society that is creating it. Therefore there is
no correct answer here, it is a matter of functionalism and constructivism.

(Gardening) Gardening: A Relational
Framework for Complex Thinking About
Complex Systems
Leo Caves and Ana Teixeira de Melo
Abstract For positive outcomes to be achieved in the management of change in
complex systems, our modes of thinking need to be congruent with the complexity of
the targeted systems. In this chapter, we draw inspiration from the concept of
gardening, conceived as a systemic activity of managing relations or the process by
which a gardener relates to the relations of a complex system, to develop a relational
thinking framework for complex thinking applied to change in complex systems. This
framework is based on a relational worldview of interventions, as systemic activities
aimed at change in complex systems. We propose a heuristic, in the form of a
recursive relational thinking method, which can be used to explore different conﬁg-
urations of relations that represent abstract entities within a modelworld. Further we
suggest that these conﬁgurations of relations can be the base for a corresponding
storyworld, to assist in the narration of change in complex systems. We present this
general abstract framework and apply it (recursively) to gardening itself as an
example of a domain of change. This exercise illustrates how the proposed relational
framework can be used to generate different models of change and supporting
narratives, as well as the ﬁtness of different modes of intervention in relation to
desired outcomes. The result is, in itself, a basic relational framework or meta-model
to guide the planning, evaluation and communication of interventions in complex
systems.

Clearing the Ground: Introduction
Cybernetics is the science or the art of manipulating defensible metaphors; showing how
they may be constructed and what can be inferred as a result of their existence (Pask 1975)
What is our capacity for affecting change in our complex world? How can we
relate to a complex system in a way that brings about a positive or desired change?
This chapter emerges from a need to know how we could organize our thinking and
acting regarding change in complex systems.
Academics, policy makers and practitioners face the challenges of tackling
systems that are complex and, therefore, not readily predictable or controllable
(Sterman 2006). Change in these systems is not linear and is dependent on a
multitude of factors, including the history of the system. Commonly, interventions
have been designed using forms of thinking and practice that were developed from
simplistic, reductionist and mechanistic worldviews and applied to a world that is . . .
not (or is only in restricted circumstances) (Capra 1997). Consequently, the outcome
of change is often not the one that was aimed for and unexpected behaviours may
emerge, sometimes as negative side effects (Sterman 2006). In light of this, we
believe the way we think and the way we conduct interventions needs to be
congruent with the nature of the systems we seek to inﬂuence: we need complex
thinking for complex systems.
In this chapter, we do not review theories of complex systems nor even core
concepts (Kelso 1997; Érdi 2007; Mitchell 2009). Instead, we focus on a framework
of thinking that has a pragmatic focus and supports the exploration and general
practices of those who seek effective ways of relating to the complex world. Rather
than focusing on speciﬁc systems, we develop an abstract systemic framework and
consider general questions, inviting the reader to think (i) “what are the things I need
to think about when I think of change in my system of interest?”, and (ii) “how do I
need to think about these things, and the relations between them?” The application of
the framework requires system-speciﬁc content that must be built for a particular
system or class of systems. We hope that this framework will be applicable to
different types of systems and we invite the reader to try to explore it in their own
settings. We believe this framework is capable of supporting a sufﬁciently complex
thinking to guide effective action in different kinds of systems, but also to provide a
common basis for the evaluation of interventions. We also believe it can provide a
simple and familiar language to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue. We invite the
reader for an exploratory mindwalk (Capra 1990) into the terrains of complex
thinking while keeping a focus on their own systems of interest.

Laying Out the Gardening: A Relational Framework
for Complex Thinking About Complex Systems
A new knowledge of organization is capable of creating a new organization of knowledge
(Morin 1992)
In the tradition of thinkers concerned with developing forms of complex thinking
(e.g. Whitehead 1929; Bateson 1979; Morin 2005, 2008) we sought to explore the
relations implicated in change in complex systems in a way that reﬂects aspects of
their systemic organisation and properties. We looked for a way of thinking that
captured the relations from which a whole emerges and transforms and that could be
applied to different kinds of systems.
2.1
Gardening as an Inspiration for Thinking About Complex
Systems
Gardening provided us the inspiration for how to think about interventions in
complex systems (i.e., process). We view gardening as a systemic activity of
managing relations or the process by which a gardener relates to the relations of a
complex system (e.g., the plants to the soil, the different plants to each other, the
garden to its surroundings, the capacity of the gardener in relation to the kind of
garden envisaged).
It is also a good example of interventions in nature—the archetype of a complex
system. Therefore, it should provide us with relevant information to understand what
we need to think about when we think of interventions in complex systems (i.e.,
content).
Is gardening a domain of activity for change in complex systems that is sufﬁ-
ciently rich to offer insights that are applicable to a broad range of other complex
systems? Is the analogy appropriate? Control in behaviour of (complex) systems is
the central concern of cybernetics (Wiener 1961). The requirement for an effective
(model of a) controller is captured in the Law of Requisite Variety (Ashby 1958),1
which states that any controller for a system needs to be at least as rich as the aspects
of the dynamical behaviour of the system that we wish to explore or inﬂuence. In
principle, a controller that is rich enough (in terms of the numbers of states it can
generate) can absorb the essential complexities of the system, as experienced by a
given observer, and will support an understanding of the capacity for system
changes, and the possible effective modes of change, even if it does not provide a
clear vision of what it changes into. However, if the controller is relatively
1The Law of Requisite Variety has different forms: “The larger the variety of actions available to a
control system, the larger the variety of perturbations it is able to compensate.” or “Variety destroys
variety”, or as Stafford Beer (1979) rephrased it: “Variety absorbs variety”.

impoverished, it will fail in these respects and this may lead to misunderstanding,
inappropriate interventions and unexpected or even damaging outcomes.
2.2
A Relational Worldview
We adopt a relational wordview as a way to build models of complex systems
through the essential relations that sustain them and that are implicated in change. In
a relational worldview, all of the components exist in relation to one another, i.e.,
they are relata (Whitehead 1920). Any entity is deﬁned in a relationship with
something else (Varela 1976; Cassirer et al. 1923; Kelso and Engstrom 2008). The
thing to which it is related will confer it a different identity or add a new perspective
to it. All visions regarding any entity are, therefore, relative to the choice of the
position of an observer, and the properties that are highlighted will change according
to the particular relative position adopted (Goguen and Varela 1979). Systems are
relational entities and they have to be understood with a focus on those relations that
build and transform them. This relational perspective aligns with that of Bateson
(1979), who deﬁned relationship as a product of double description arising from
complementary perspectives (e.g., how binocular vision arises from the interaction
of monocular views from each eye). Different types of interaction give rise to
different relationships, allowing for a variety of descriptions, depending on one’s
point of view. Due to their richness, complex systems require a plurality of descrip-
tions and each part of the system will appear in a different way depending on what it
is being compared or related to.
2.3
A Recursive Relational Thinking Process
Relating concepts and ideas through comparison has long been used in the social
sciences as a way of producing meaningful information regarding certain phenom-
ena or for building theories (Glaser and Strauss 1967). One of the difﬁculties of
analysing a complex system is that there is often a myriad of elements to be
considered and a multitude of relations between them, all of which are implicated
in the system’s form and capacity for transformation. To address this, we needed a
feasible way to explore this (potentially vast) space of relations in order to be able to
identify the critical ones—those on which change could depend.
To this end, we looked to the characteristics of complex systems themselves.
Complex systems have ways of compressing information through self-organisation
(Haken 1987). The enormous variety of behaviours and elements at the lower levels
of the system are synergetically coupled into new coordination variables (patterns,
forms, structures, etc.) that reduce the number of parameters needed to understand
the behaviour of the system (Haken 1984; Kelso 1997). In our case, we were looking
152
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

for the emergence of new patterns of ideas about the system at hand that would
provide understanding and suggest actions for effective intervention.
We tried to mimic the behaviour of a complex system not just by exploring and
coordinating the relations between the important elements, but by going further and
exploring relations of relations in a way that allowed for the compression of
information and the emergence of novel patterns of ideas about how to manage
change in that system. Detailed phenomena at one level, requiring explicit consid-
eration of multiple interactions, are implicitly subsumed by a reconceptualised
description at another.2
We aimed to develop a method based on systematically relating the core relata
that, according to our worldview, we considered necessary to understand the system
and the intervention. Therefore, we developed a recursive relational thinking process
that allowed for a systematic exploration of relations within and around our system of
interest. We explored our worldview, its constituent elements and relations, using this
method to build up conﬁgurations of relations that provide insight into a complex
system and its capacity for change.
We needed to distinguish between the base relata of the system before exploring
their relations. Then, the build-up of new levels of description of a system through
relating relata provides higher order concepts that, themselves, can be related both
within and between levels. In so doing, we aimed to produce meaningful information
and eventually assist the emergence of some degree of novelty (e.g., perspective,
insight).
To be able to deal with the diversity of relata and their richness we assumed that
we could not just compare relata, but had to compare relations themselves—that
thereby become relata in a recursive fashion. In doing so, we aimed to compress
information into new levels of description without having to cover all possible
combinations of individual relata.
By systematically comparing relata we build different trajectories or pathways
leading to a higher order perspective leading to new insight. Because the relata of the
system are interconnected, in principle, we could start with any two relata and explore
their connection with any other individual relata or their relations and similar patterns
would eventually emerge [equiﬁnality (von Bertalanffy 1971)]. Nevertheless, differ-
ent routes could produce different nuances that could be relevant for different
purposes [multiﬁnality (Wilden 2013)]. By comparing relations, novel (higher
order) relata emerge that can then be further related. Due to their emergent character,
understanding of these higher order relata may not be reducible to their component
relata in simple ways.
Considering the different base relata of the system (Fig. 13.2, later), we could
conduct multiple iterations of relating (relations) at different levels until we reach
2For example, the different languages accounting for micro-, meso- or macroscopic phenomena in
physics, or the individual, group, or population level descriptions in the social sciences. Although
these examples relate to emergence of new levels of description related to (a hierarchy of) spatial
scale, we consider the more general case of the emergence of novel concepts at new levels of
relating relations.
13

either a perspective that we consider to be sufﬁciently meaningful to provide insight,
allow experimentation or inform practice, or some form of saturation is achieved
(Glaser and Strauss 1967; Miles and Huberman 1994).
Although some pathways are possibly more laborious or slow to lead to mean-
ingful information, we should be able to start anywhere and, by moving towards
higher-order patterns, ﬁnd similar patterns of properties or types of information. The
choices of the starting point, of the relata to be considered and of the relational
pathways to explore, are dependent on the observer’s previous knowledge of the
ﬁeld and their preferences. The important point is that that the exploration is
systematic and that the observer tracks the trajectory of iterations so they can rebuild
or revisit the trajectory at particular points to experiment with different routes. A
visual representation of the building of the relational pathway can be of assistance. In
the end, the observer should be able to see a web of connections covering almost all
the relata that were set up.
In Fig. 13.1 we present an abstract representation of a relational pathway. The
pathway represents a trajectory of relating relata to each other to build up new levels
of relata. The process moves towards a conﬁguration of relations that forms the
entities within a hypothetical relational world. The process starts by laying out the
initial relata represented by black dots and Roman letters. The observer starts at one
given point and attempts to relate to relata. Once a relation is established, it is taken
as if it is a new relatum. In Fig. 13.1, we used the dotted line to transform a given

relation into a new relatum (dot on the ﬁgure) to be then related. The pathway may
continue from that relatum, or new individual relata can be connected before moving
on to a point of establishing a relation between relations. In our example, in Iteration
1 (I1) relata A and B are transformed into relation α. In iteration 2 we choose to
explore the relation between C and D from which a new point β is created. Only in
Iteration 4 (I4) do we start to relate relations. The relation of relations is taken to be
of a different order and is represented by Arabic numerals. For example, in Iteration
4 the relation between α and γ construct the higher order relata 1. These second order
relata can also be built by comparing one base relata with one second order relation,
as in Iteration 5 (I5). Finally, at iteration 7 (I7) a third order relation is built that
relates two relations of relations. If the observer ﬁnds it easier to see how many of the
relata have been covered, triangles can be built by using the points that include the
two relata plus the point created to represent their relation.
We are not proposing a mechanical procedure or algorithm, but a ﬂexible,
accessible process for a principled recursive comparison of relations that is explicitly
dependent on the cognitive capacities of the thinker and their choices (Mauthner and
Doucet 2003). In the proposed framework, relata at different levels can be related in
recursive loops. Ideally, after several iterations, the thinker would have covered,
through consideration (and selection) of individual relata and their relations (and
relations of relations, etc.), most of the relational landscape could be explored. The
important point is to track the trajectories so they can be rebuilt if new insight is
necessary or if the evaluation of a trajectory reveals poor outcomes and new
alternatives need to be explored.
2.4
A Relational Framework (or Meta-Model)
Together, the relational worldview and the recursive relational thinking result in a
meta-model in the form of a relational framework for complex thinking about
complex systems. Using this framework, different models can be built that support
different narratives. These can be used to describe and explain potential interven-
tions and their effects, and to support case study evaluations (Yin 2013).
2.5
Relational Modelworlds
The result of using the framework on a particular domain (e.g., in this chapter, that of
gardening) is a set of conﬁgurations of relationships from which different higher-
order concepts or perspectives can emerge that provide insight into the system in
relation to change processes. These concepts emerge from the recursive relational
thinking process and provide useful abstract entities that can be used to build models
of change processes in a given domain. As these entities can be generated and
13

155

combined in different ways, to create different models, they provide the basis for a
relational modelworld.3
2.6
The Roles of the Meta-Observer
In this chapter, we adopt the perspective of a meta-observer who aims to understand
and evaluate action and change in a complex system. This observer, presenting the
properties of observers as deﬁned by Varela (1976) (capacity for indication, capacity
for time, capacity for agreement) is implicitly part of our model. The observer is not
‘neutral’ but necessarily guided by our own preferences (von Foerster 2007).
In this chapter, the authors take the role of a meta-observer. In other contexts, this
meta-observer could be, for example, a consultant, a supervisor, or an advisor. An
element of the world that is being explored could also take a meta-stance or a
reﬂexive position and adopt this role. The role may also be distributed among
different elements of an internal or external system. Different relative positions of
this meta-observer will likely present different capacities, and provide different
insights, leading to different types of interventions and evaluations.

Planting the Gardening: Foundations
for the Construction of a Modelworld for Gardening
I think this is what hooks one to gardening: it is the closest one can come to being present at
creation. (In Demakis, 2012)
3.1
A Relational Worldview for Gardening as an Archetype
of Interventions in Complex Systems
Gardening provided the inspiration and analogy for our thinking and the develop-
ment of our framework. Additionally, it offers rich illustrations of the theory and
practice of managing relations in nature and a common familiar language to which
readers from different disciplinary cultures can relate.
We needed a model capable of informing us about what were the minimal number
of components needed to describe and explain change in complex systems, as well as
the core relations between them. The selection of the core components is grounded in
systemic and ecological models that call attention to processes of mutual causality,
3We use the term modelworld for the results of the meta-modelling framework that can create a
range of models.

and co-evolution in living systems (Bateson 1972; Capra 1990; Macy 1991), as well
as to the active role of the observer in shaping the reality they seek to address (Varela
and Maturana 1987; von Foerster 2007).
If we want to understand gardening as an analogous to interventions in complex
systems, we need to be able to explore how different conﬁgurations of relations (sets
of relations between relations) within our worldview sustain certain types of out-
comes (e.g., particular types or purposes of gardens).
3.2
Base Relata
When thinking of our worldview for gardening, the ﬁrst step was to identify our base
relata,4 i.e., the basic constituents of our world that were to be explored in relation to
each other. The choice of the base relata is dependent on the meta-observer’s
knowledge and intuition and/or could be the result of a principled modelling
methodology, e.g., Andrews et al. (2011). We believe the relata we consider
below are a general starting point for the exploration of scenarios relating to affecting
change in a variety of complex systems.
Figure 13.2 presents the base relata that form the foundations of the modelworld
for gardening.
The core relata are a trinity of Garden, Environment and Gardener (more gener-
ally the System, Environment and Intervenor5). To these base relata we add relations
of coupling between them. In addition, for the Gardener, we consider their reﬂexivity
in relation to both the Garden and the Environment. Time is an essential relatum for
change processes and is largely implicit in our scheme (Sect. 13.4.1); we explicitly
consider time in the relation between the Current Garden and Future Garden.
For these relata, we needed to identify and consider which characteristics are
important. For the Garden and the Environment, we focused on their Complexity.
For the Gardener, we focused on both their Pragmatic and Theoretical Systemicity6
and Resourcefulness. The quality of the characteristics of the relata (e.g., high, low)
also needs to be considered. More details about these relata and their characteristics
are provided in Sect. 13.4 below.
4Note that the relata we start with can be both objects and relations, reﬂecting our relational stance.
5The name “Intervenor” may conjure up notions of an external agent of change, but as we take a
meta-position, we explicitly include it within our (meta-)model as part of the worldview (a meta-
system). Depending on the distinction being made by an observer, the intervenor can come from
outside or inside the system. It is the particular type of relation (e.g., intention) in respect of the
possibility of change that provides the distinction for this role.

Applying the Relational Thinking Framework
to Gardening
Figure 13.3 represents the development of the relational thinking applied to the
worldview of gardening as we explored it, at different stages. We decided to start
with the garden from our base (zeroth order) relata and selected a property of the
garden to explore, namely its complexity. By comparing the complexity of the current
garden and the complexity of our future garden, we created a relation corresponding
to the complexity of change as our initial ﬁrst order relation.
We then progressively moved to other individual relata, relating them, until we
started to relate either relations with individual base relata (elements or relations) or

relations with relations progressing to higher orders until we felt that the map of
relations was signiﬁcantly covered.
In the following sections we trace the path we used in this process of exploring our
relata and creating and relating relations. In exploring each relation, we asked: “What
is it that emerges?”, “How do the individual relata interact?”, “What is represented by
the interaction and what new entity emerges from this conﬁguration of relations”? We
explored each new individual relatum and its interactions, trying to understand “What
does this mean? To what does this correspond in the world of gardening?” In this
process, and by reﬂecting on the interaction of prototypes of relations or states, we
started to identify patterns (fuzzy relational prototypes or conceptual categories)
corresponding to different expressions of those relations. When transforming a
relation into a new relatum we sought to condense information by abstracting the
extreme positions of the emergent characteristics and using these “polar” prototypes
to explore the following interactions, in order to facilitate reasoning. Although there
is necessarily some loss of richness, we tried to keep the previous level in the
background to assist us in identifying important nuances of the new interactions.

3.4
A Relational Framework for Thinking About Change
in Complex Systems
We have developed a relational framework (or meta-model) for thinking about
change in complex systems, using gardening as an example. In summary, playing
with the recursiveness that deﬁnes many complex systems, we applied a gardening-
informed complex thinking framework to a relational worldview of gardening as an
intervention in a complex system. We explored gardening as an example of an
activity that is generally familiar and that provides a rich setting in which to consider
what kinds of elements, in what kinds of relations, in what conditions are related to
what kinds of outcomes.

Cultivating Gardening: Using the Relational Framework
to Explore the Modelworld for Gardening
A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit
in. Greek proverb
Our framework was built to understand change in complex systems. Change is a
transformation from one state to another state in time. Our starting point for the
exploration of gardening was a comparison between the state of the current garden
and that of the future garden (Fig. 13.2). For that comparison, we focused on the
property of complexity of the garden. However, before we explore this, we offer
some considerations about time.
4.1
Time, Relative Timescales, Timeliness and History
Gardening is an exercise in thinking about and managing relations (and relations of
relations). An important consideration is how these relations change in time. This
brings in considerations of relative timescale, and the notion of timeliness.
Driving Oscillations Many aspects of gardening are driven by the natural tempo of
our planet’s orbit around the sun. This celestial relation drives and entrains many
environmental processes such as the progression in the expression of nature, at two
coupled timescales: (i) the annual seasons: winter, dormant and fallow; spring,
awakening and budding; summer, resplendent and blossoming; autumn, decay and
decline; and (ii) the diurnal cycle with its 24-hour period.
Relative Timescales and Coupling Between Timescales Gardening naturally pro-
vides a context for the consideration of multiple relative timescales that need to be
understood for effective management. Different practices are appropriate at different
timescales. For example, the common gardening rituals occurring: (i) daily, such as
160
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

watering, pest-vigilance, dead-heading; (ii) weekly, such as pruning, weeding, mow-
ing; (iii) monthly, such as transplanting, thinning-out; (iv) seasonally, such as
planting, harvesting; (v) annually, such as plant rotation, soil rotovation/tilling;
and (vi) longer term, such as a transition to organic, establishing microenviron-
ments/services, e.g., a new pond; maturation/achieving balance.
A key feature of these interventions at multiple timescales is the way in which
they are coupled: practices at each level support or facilitate actions at other levels.
For example, the seasonal production of fruits and vegetables is supported by annual
preparation of the soil, but also the daily ritual of watering and watching for pests,
that in turn supports weekly selective harvesting of the produce.
Timeliness Another important aspect of gardening practice is that of knowing when
is the right time for a particular action or practice. Within the rhythm of the seasons,
there are particular beats that are associated with different kinds of actions. For
example, the seasonal dependence of particular rituals: in winter, pruning of plants;
in spring, sowing of seeds; in summer, harvesting of produce; in autumn, digging
over the soil (and so on). The timing of these actions/interventions are organised in
the form of a Gardener’s Calendar which guides the gardener as to what should they
be doing, when.
One ritual exempliﬁes timeliness, weeding. Weeding needs to be done often and
in a timely fashion. It is best to remove weeds before they become established
(putting down stronger roots, making them more difﬁcult to remove, and more prone
to recurrence). It is often better to weed in the morning or after rainfall, when the soil
is moist, as this aids their removal. There can be grave consequences to not attending
to these gardening rituals. Any temptation to skip weeding must be set against the
aphorism “One year of seed; seven years of weed”.7
History In gardening, we generally don’t start from a clean slate. The garden,
environment and gardener all have a history that may need to be considered in
relation to other relata. These histories may impact upon such things as couplings,
complexity, etc. For example, a previous use of pesticides in the neighbouring
environment will impact on the timescales for a change towards an organic garden.

4.2
The Complexity of Change
4.2.1
Relation in Time: Complexity of the Current Garden 
Complexity of Future Garden
When starting to think about gardening, one of the ﬁrst issues to be considered is the
characteristics of the garden as you ﬁnd it (the Current Garden). What are the
elements present, how diverse are they, how are they connected, what structures
exist, what have they been used for? These may (or may not) combine into a
particular type of garden. When you think of the structure of the garden you may
want to think in terms of:
•
Diversity (heterogeneity) of its elements: Gardens varying from low(er) to high
(er) diversity (e.g., herb, ﬂower, orchard, vegetable gardens, kitchen, cottage).
•
Nature or type of elements: Gardens with plants that need particular conditions
(e.g., light, shade, humidity) with particular categories of elements (e.g., with
water or rocks) or combinations of elements of a different nature, such as the
proportion of organic to non-organic elements (e.g., gardens mainly with ﬂowers
or grass vs. gardens mainly with sand or rocks).
•
Density of elements: Gardens varying from low(er) density to high(er) density
(e.g., market garden).
•
Boundary conditions: The degree and nature of the connection and differentia-
tion from the surrounding environment (e.g., open gardens, walled gardens).
•
Internal organisation (speciﬁc properties of the relations between the ele-
ments): The different types of layout of gardens and different zones within the
layout; gardens within gardens (subsystems), the degree of connectedness (plants
in large beds or spread vases) (e.g., Chinese, Zen, radial gardens).
•
Function/purpose: The different functions or purposes supported by the garden
(e.g., utilitarian/productive, aesthetic/sensual, conservation/diversity, social/lei-
sure). This will necessarily be dependent on the perspective being adopted.
The structure of the garden itself will create constraints (Varela and Maturana
1987) regarding the type of change to be achieved and the demand of resources to
support the desired transformation. The gardener then needs to think about what kind
162
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

of garden is aimed for (the Future Garden8). Different gardens will present different
types of complexity.9 The elements above relate to the structural complexity. Other
expressions of complexity may need to be considered, such as the degree to which
the garden changes and how it changes through time (dynamical complexity). For
example, does the garden stay approximately the same or does it change throughout
the year with elements that operate on different timescales?
Types and Levels of Change When thinking about gardening or managing the
relations with a complex system, we necessarily need to think of a dynamic process,
which unfolds through time, and about some degree of change. The management of
complexity is about managing the relations that underlie or express change, both
within the system and in regard to its coupling with the environment (cf. Sect. 13.4.6).
We focus, for now, on the internal relations within the garden. Often intervenors are
frustrated with the failure to achieve a certain type or level of change and also
frequently we hear reports of unintended and unpredictable changes. In some occa-
sions, this relates to a mismatch between the type and level of change aimed for, and
the type and level of change achieved in the given targeted system. It can also relate to
a mismatch between the level of change induced and the level of change needed
considering the internal structure of the system or the structures and dynamics
implicated in the maintenance of a type of problem or solution (Watzlawick et al.
1974; Meadows 2008).
When thinking about gardening and change one necessarily needs to attend to the
complexity of the change that is aimed for, but also for the potential transitions
between different kinds of changes that may be enacted as a result of the self-
organisation of the system in response to the perturbations induced by the gardening.
This means that although we may be working for minor changes, aiming, for
example, at maintenance, there is a possibility of inadvertently driving the system
to a point of transition (Guckenheimer 2007) where deeper transformations may
occur leading to a different kind of system (with different structures and rules).
Watzlawick and collaborators (1974) differentiated changes of ﬁrst order and
changes of second order. The former can be deﬁned as more superﬁcial changes, or
quantitative changes, that operate within or for the maintenance of a general internal
structure or rules. The latter correspond to qualitative changes, changes of kind, or
changes in the rules of the underlying logic of the system.
Degrees of Complexity The complexity of change emerges as a relation of difference
between the complexity of the Current garden and the complexity of the Future
garden, which we consider as varying from low to high. The variations of complexity
can occur within the same order of change or correspond to a change of order. For
8We acknowledge a distinction between the gardener’s intended garden (Target Garden) and that
actually achieved through the gardening process (Future Garden). This deserves more attention,
outside of the scope of this chapter.
9There are many deﬁnitions and measures of complexity that are reviewed elsewhere (Manson
2001; Ladyman et al. 2013). The reader should carefully consider the deﬁnitions and measures that
are most suitable for a given situation.
13

example,10 a gardener may want to increase the structural complexity of the garden,
by increasing the number and diversity of ﬂowering plants, but not change its
topology. It may happen that one of the new species proliferates within the ﬂowerbeds
and outcompetes the other ﬂowers, leading to a state of lower complexity, within the
existing topology of the garden (ﬁrst order). Alternatively, the new species may
change the overall soil balance (e.g., pH, moisture, microbiota) which has a knock-
on effect on the rest of the garden, e.g., promoting unanticipated growth of adventi-
tious species, resulting in a drastic change in the character of the garden (second
order).
In scenarios involving transformation, i.e., changes of kind, ethical considerations
may be appropriate.
4.2.2
Patterns of the Complexity of Change
By roughly conceptualizing the complexity of a garden on a continuum varying from
low to high, and comparing the Current garden with that of the Future garden, we
identify eight broad fuzzy prototypes or patterns of the complexity of change as
presented in Table 13.1.
We then classiﬁed the patterns extracted according to the degree of the complex-
ity of the change, considering three levels, low, moderate and high, and deﬁned them
as described below:
High Complexity of Change
•
Low to high (complexity) transformational change (second order): transfor-
mation into a different, more complex, kind of system.
•
High to high (complexity) transformational change (second order): transfor-
mation into a different kind of system with similar complexity.

•
High to low (complexity) transformational change (second order): transfor-
mation into a different kind of system with lower complexity.
•
High to low (complexity) control maintenance (ﬁrst order): controlling the
complexity of a system, lowering it, with no change of kind.
Moderate Complexity of Change
•
High (complexity) routine maintenance (ﬁrst order): promoting changes that
maintain the high levels of complexity of a system while preventing deeper
transformations.11
•
Low to low (complexity) transformational change (second order): transfor-
mation into a different kind of garden with lower complexity.
•
Low to high (complexity) nurturing maintenance (ﬁrst order): promoting
changes that increase the complexity of the system, without changes of kind.
Low Complexity of Change
•
Low (complexity) routine maintenance (ﬁrst order): promoting changes that
maintain the low level of complexity of a system.
Staging Change Some of these changes are more likely to facilitate others, depending
on the history of the system and the particular conditions in which gardening occurs.
For example, nurturing maintenance may intentionally (or inadvertently) lead to second
order change from low to high complexity, while control maintenance could lead to
second order, high to low changes. This may lead to strategies where larger changes
occur through a number of intermediate stages, analogous to the multistage develop-
mental processes of some biological systems (Ryan 2011). The gardener may need to
monitor the change process closely in circumstances where transitions between differ-
ent types of change are likely to occur. Change can take many forms. While in some
cases change may be catastrophic, with drastic qualitative transformations, in other
cases change is more incremental or quantitative (Lerner 2001).
As the gardener explores the possibilities of their garden, it may be useful to
consider its history, i.e., the types of changes it has experienced. The history may
inform the gardener about the responsiveness of the garden and its preferences in
terms of states. This may help to anticipate the possibilities of future change, while
keeping attentive to the adjacent possible (Kaufmann 2000).
11A highly complex system may be poised for transformation. Therefore, maintaining high com-
plexity without change of type requires a more intensive and complex form of maintenance that we
distinguish from regular routine maintenance.

Gardener’s Capacity
4.3.1
Relation: Theoretical Orientation to Systemicity  Pragmatic
Capacity/Resourcefulness for Systemicity
You should rather be grateful for the weeds you have in your mind, because eventually they
will enrich your practice Shunryu Suzuki (1973)
The gardener is central to gardening. We think of the gardener’s capacity as
encompassing their ability to understand and/or explain the behaviour of the garden,
in particular the complexity of the organization of relations that sustain it (i) as it is;
(ii) as it was; and (iii) as it could be. Therefore, when exploring gardening one must
conceive of the gardener’s orientation or theoretical capacity to systemicity: their
theoretical, conceptual, descriptive and/or explanatory framework, and the extent to
which they apprehend the complexity of the system and its systemic properties. On
the other hand, we must consider the pragmatic aspects of gardening and the
gardener’s resources to act in a way that is congruent with and informed by their
understanding of the garden’s complexity. The gardener’s capacity is therefore a
relation between their orientation to systemicity and their pragmatic capacity,
including the available resources. For example, the gardener may have a good
understanding of the disease transmission among plants, but have a limited knowl-
edge of techniques to treat it systemically, rather relying on limited, symptom-
focused treatments: this relates to high systemic orientation, but low pragmatic
capacity/resourcefulness. By contrast, take a gardener with a lot of tools and
resources that could be used to affect the internal relations of the garden but, without
the systemic understanding, their very pragmatic capacity may actually cause harm.
166
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

Theoretical Capacity A gardener needs a model to approach their garden that
provides some understanding of the system and its main organizational and opera-
tional processes. This model may have been theoretically or empirically driven. It
may have been developed for a particular garden and result from the observation of
such a garden for prolonged periods of time, or rely on more general knowledge
regarding the class or kind of garden to which it belongs.
The theoretical orientation of a gardener to systemicity can be understood as an
indicator of the gardener’s readiness or preparedness for gardening. There are
different ways a gardener can learn about a system or a class of systems in order to
understand the possibilities of change. Learning about a general class of gardens can
be done independently or with assistance. A gardener may be self-taught (e.g.,
through gardening books, or TV programs) or have received formal education (e.g.,
gardening courses). Some gardeners learn by their own experience. However, in
gardening there is a long tradition of apprenticeship, learning at the elbow of a more
experienced gardener. A gardener may be more or less specialised in a particular type
of garden. A broader knowledge base may be useful in situations that have not been
well studied or when the gardener needs to problem solve and deal with unexpected
events. However, the knowledge available may not be applicable to their particular
garden and new investigations are needed, often in relation to practice. Therefore, the
gardener is also necessarily a researcher.
Pragmatic Capacity The pragmatic capacity includes (i) materials used in garden-
ing; (ii) the tools available; and (iii) the speciﬁc techniques available for gardening
and for intervening at multiple and different relational levels of the organisation of the
garden, as required by a systemic conceptualisation. Many of the techniques of
gardening are inherently systemic and can be regarded as different means of moder-
ating the coupling between the garden and the environment (or at a different scale, a
plant and its local environment within the garden). Depending on the type of coupling
and moderation required, a number of different tools and techniques can be utilised,
that may employ different types of approaches and technologies.
An example of a moderation technique is the promotion of tighter coupling of
system elements to enhance transfer of energy. There can be moderation of plant
nutrient intake by plants through remodelling of the structure of the soil and inter-
fering with the activity of its micro-organisms and the relation to plants. This can be
performed through mechanical means (e.g., rotavator, spade, fork, hoe) which in turn
promotes the soil ecology. Alternatively (or in combination), the application of
fertilizer or compost uses chemical means to alter soil composition that will provide
energy to plants.
Another example pertains to the reconﬁguration of the spatial relations within
and between elements of a system to promote their growth. There can be an inﬂuence
on the spacing between plants, by cutting away overlapping (or overshadowing)
foliage and, thereby, affect plant growth. For an individual plant, pruning can be
used to stimulate new growth, for example, towards increasing the yield of fruit
trees. This is typically performed by mechanical means through such tools as the axe,
saw, mower, etc.

Gardening Philosophies Different approaches to gardening combine particular
theories (or conceptions) with associated (e.g., dictated, preferred, forbidden) prag-
matics. Examples of such gardening philosophies are: organic, working without
artiﬁcial agrochemicals, e.g., Bradley et al. (2010); permaculture, working in har-
mony with natural principles, e.g., Hemenway (2009); hydroponics, substituting soil
for water as the growing medium, e.g., Nicholls (1990); and slow gardening,12 a
no-stress approach to gardening.
4.3.2
Patterns of Gardener’s Capacity
By relating the theoretical orientation to systemicity and the pragmatic capacity of
the gardener, and considering these characteristics as varying from high to low, we
were able to identify four broad proﬁles of gardeners as illustrated in Table 13.2.
The patterns or fuzzy prototypes extracted regarding the gardener’s capacity can
be deﬁned as follows:
•
High capacity: Systemically prepared and resourceful gardener
•
Moderate “pragmatic” capacity: Systemically unprepared but resourceful
gardener
•
Moderate “theoretical” capacity: Systemically prepared but unresourceful
gardener
•
Low: Systemically unprepared and unresourceful gardener

4.4
The Nature of Coupling
4.4.1
Relation: Coupling Gardener-to-Garden  Coupling Garden-to-
Gardener
It is difﬁcult to think about gardening without thinking of the gardener. In our own
experience, we may recall cases where people repeated established procedures
carefully or tried to “follow” a Master’s instructions, only to realise a very different
outcome of gardening from the one expected. Gardening is not purely mechanical; it
requires some kind of feel for the system (the notion of “green ﬁngers”).
When interacting with each other both the garden and the gardener are coupled,
meaning they will change and adapt their behaviours, to different extents, as a
function of each other (Kelso 1997). Here we consider coupling strength as how
much the garden and the gardener change as a function of the other or how reactive
they are. The nature of the coupling will inﬂuence the nature of the transformations
that are possible in the garden but also the process of change and, consequently, the
type of strategies adopted for gardening.
The degree of mutuality and strength of coupling may impact upon the choice of
strategies for gardening, or its efﬁcacy, in different ways. For example, if a gardener
is closely and strongly coupled to the system they will be able to make timely
adjustments in the strategies used, correct courses, anticipate the unfolding of certain
behaviours and of the transformations of the landscape of possibilities. If, for
example, the gardener is closely and strongly coupled with the system, but not
otherwise, they may be able to have sufﬁcient information about what other systems
are relevant to the change that could be approached to indirectly inﬂuence the system
in focus.

4.4.2
Patterns of the Nature of Coupling13
When considering the relation of how much the gardener changes as a function of a
garden and how much the garden changes as a function of the gardener we can
extrapolate four broad patterns or fuzzy prototypes of coupling, relating to the degree
of strength and mutuality of coupling (Table 13.3).
We deﬁne the four fuzzy prototypes as follows:
•
Mutual strong coupling: Symmetric coupling—both gardener and garden are
mutually engaged and changing as a function of each other.
•
Engaged garden (to gardener): Asymmetric coupling—low gardener-to-gar-
den/ high garden-to-gardener.
•
Engaged gardener (with garden): Asymmetric coupling—high gardener-to-
garden/ low garden-to-gardener.
•
Mutual weak coupling: Symmetric coupling—both gardener and garden are
disengaged and hardly change as a function of each other.

What are the implications of the intervenor changing as a function of the
system and vice versa, and how much would that condition the choice of
efﬁcacy or available strategies for promoting change?

13In building up the relational conﬁguration (Fig. 13.3), we decided not to integrate all dimensions
of the nature of coupling, choosing instead to focus on the perspective of the gardener. Neverthe-
less, when reaching higher relational levels, we returned to relate to the dimension of coupling. The
relevance of this dimension then became clear, as a moderator of other relations: the speciﬁc nature
of the coupling corresponds to variations in those relations, lowering or increasing the levels of ﬁt.

The Gardener’s Coupling Stance
4.5.1
Relation: Gardener-to-Garden Coupling  Reﬂexivity
The garden suggests there might be a place where we can meet nature halfway Michael
Pollan (2007)
Traditionally, the speciﬁc contributions of a particular intervenor have been
largely ignored as they were assumed to be “objective” or neutral, provoking changes
or interfering with the system without being changed by it. This is the case in the
original conception of cybernetics (First-order) (Wiener 1961).
Second-order cybernetics called attention to the active role of the observer and the
impossibility of separating the one who observes (or intervenes) and that which is
being observed or subject to intervention (von Foerster 2007). When the intervenor/
observer is highly structurally coupled with the system they aim to inspect or change,
it is likely that they will also be subject to change, and changes in the target system are
identiﬁed as changes in the gardener’s reactions to it (Varela and Maturana 1987).
Constructivist theorists acknowledged the uniqueness of the contributions of the
individual intervenor to the system and to the construction of the understanding of it,
as well as the impossibility of a completely detached objective or neutral stance (von
Glasersfeld 1984; Hoffman 1993). As Maturana (1987) states, “anything said is said
by an observer”. While in complex systems science the role of the observer is still
frequently ignored, thinkers such as Morin (2005) have stated that a science informed
by complex thinking should be able to bridge the subjective and the objective, the
participant and the observer, as complementary facets of a complex world.
Reﬂexivity In this context, we understand reﬂexivity as the extent to which interve-
nors are capable of taking the position of observer themselves (Kegan 1982; Marks-
Tarlow et al. 2002), allowing them to reﬂect on their contributions to the coupling as
well as on the process implicated in their relation to the system (Hoffman 1993).
Additionally, the reﬂexivity may facilitate the creation of new knowledge regarding
the system, by transforming the relations of the garden and gardener in the coupling
into meaningful information about the processes regulating both. Reﬂexivity thus
becomes a central component of a gardener’s coupling stance. If we assume the role
of intervenor as an essential part of thinking about change in complex systems,
reﬂexivity will necessarily be implicit in any dimension implicated in gardening.
Nevertheless, we believe it must be brought forth explicitly as the degree of reﬂexivity
that a gardener is capable of.
4.5.2
Patterns of Coupling Stance
By relating the gardener’s degree of coupling to the garden and their degree of
reﬂexivity in that coupling we derived four fuzzy patterns of coupling stance as
illustrated in Table 13.4.
13
(Gardening) Gardening: A Relational Framework for Complex Thinking. . .
171

The patterns are deﬁned as follows:
•
Adaptive stance: The gardener is strongly coupled and highly reﬂexive
•
Impulsive stance: The gardener is strongly coupled but poorly reﬂexive
•
Intellectual stance: The gardener is weakly coupled, but highly reﬂexive
•
Disconnected stance: The gardener is weakly coupled and non-reﬂexive

What does the intervenor need to know about the behaviour of the system in
order support and monitor its change?
•
How can the intervenor obtain the relevant information regarding the states
and operations of the system?
•
How aware is the intervenor of their inﬂuence on the system and vice versa?
How aware is the intervenor of what factors contribute to shape the vision
(e.g., assumptions, expectations, models, explanations, goals) that guides
the coupling to the system?
4.6
Nature of Coupling Garden-Environment
4.6.1
Relation: Coupling Garden-to-Environment  Coupling
Environment-to-Garden
What deﬁnes a garden is a distinction between what is considered inside it and outside
it. This distinction is dependent on an observer (Goguen and Varela 1979; Maturana
1988) and based on several criteria that can include physical, biological, legal,
psychological or other. To some extent, some gardens also deﬁne themselves by
integrating into their own operations and feeding in the products of their own self-
referential activities (Maturana and Varela 1991). On the other hand, the garden and
all that is considered its environment deﬁne each other in a relation of mutual
dependence. Therefore, the garden’s emergence and transformation needs to consid-
ered in relation to its eco-self-organization (Morin 2005).
A garden is connected to and embedded within other systems that constitute its
environment (encompassing physical, biological and social factors) that, together
with their relations, deﬁne an ecosystem (the community of organisms in relation to
the environment) (Begon et al. 2009).

Not all other systems or their elements are equally important for all the activities or
existence of the garden. There will be relative degrees of dependence and autonomy
of the garden in relation to the environment. Some will have larger effects due to their
proximity, their degree of connectedness, or their relations to other systems to which
the garden is more closely connected. Their importance (relative degree of coupling)
is indicated by their mutual response to perturbation (Varela and Maturana 1987).
The same can be said about the elements and system that constitute the environment
and their relation to the garden.
4.6.2
Patterns of Coupling Garden-Environment
We can think of coupling in terms of strength and directionality (garden-to-environ-
ment; environment-to-garden), and their relations result in the nature of coupling for
which we have abstracted four general fuzzy prototypes or patterns (Table 13.5).
The patterns encountered are deﬁned as follows:
•
Mutual high coupling: Symmetric coupling—garden and environment are
mutually coupled and changing as a function of each other.
•
Engaged environment (with garden): Asymmetric coupling—the garden is
poorly coupled to its environment and changing little as a function of it, while
the environment is strongly coupled to the garden and changing as a function of it.
•
Engaged garden (with environment): Asymmetric coupling—the garden is
highly coupled to its environment and changing as a function of it but the
environment is poorly coupled with the garden and changing little as a function
of it.
•
Mutual weak coupling: Symmetric coupling—both garden and environment are
poorly coupled and changing little as a function of each other.

terms. The degree of coupling of the gardener to the environment may be particularly
important in cases when the garden is poorly responsive to the gardener. When this
occurs but the garden is highly responsive to the environment, the gardener may use
approaches that affect the garden indirectly by perturbing its environment or its
relation to it (cf. gardening philosophies in Sect. 4.3). In other situations when the
environment is poorly responsive to the gardener there are constraints posed on the
type of strategies available.
4.7.2
Patterns of Coupling Gardener-Environment14
We have abstracted four fuzzy patterns related to the coupling of the gardener to the
garden’s environment, as presented in Table 13.6.
The patterns extracted are deﬁned as follows:
•
Mutual high coupling: Symmetric coupling—gardener and garden’s environ-
ment are mutually coupled and changing as a function of each other.
•
Engaged environment (with gardener): Asymmetric coupling—the gardener is
poorly coupled to the garden’s environment and changing little as a function of it,
but the environment is strongly coupled to the gardener and changing as a
function of it.
•
Engaged gardener (with environment): Asymmetric coupling—the gardener is
highly coupled to the garden’s environment and changing as a function of it, but

ronment are poorly coupled and changing little as a function of each other.

Relative Ecosystemic (In)dependency of Change
4.8.1
Relation: Coupling Garden-to-Environment  Complexity
of Change
The type of change aimed for may involve different degrees of freedom that can be
related to the nature of the coupling of the garden to its environment. In other words,
some changes are more or less (in)dependent of the environment, due to the nature of
coupling, and its structural and dynamic conditions. Depending on its nature, such
coupling may assist or resist change; it may even derail, or reroute the attempted
changes.15
4.8.2
Patterns of Ecosystemic (In)dependency of Change
By relating the degree of complexity of change with the degree of coupling of the
garden to its environment we abstracted four patterns or fuzzy prototypes of the
degree of ecosystemic (in)dependency of change, as illustrated in Table 13.7.
The moderate positions represent situations that could, depending on the circum-
stances, result in a change of the degree of coupling, as described below:
•
High dependency of change: The garden is highly coupled to the environment
and the complexity of change tends towards being high. The unfolding and
outcome of change will be highly dependent on characteristics of the ecosystem.
•
Moderate “watch coupling”: The garden is poorly coupled to the environment
and the complexity of change is high, but as the garden increases in complexity
the nature of the coupling may change, lowering or increasing the dependency on
the environment. Therefore, monitoring changes in the garden-environment cou-
pling, as the complexity of the garden changes, may be important.
•
Moderate “watch environment”: The garden is highly coupled to the environ-
ment and the complexity of change tends towards being low. In principle, change
could occur in a relatively independent way. However, if the environment is

subject to signiﬁcant changes, then the nature of the coupling to the garden may
also change, lowering or increasing the dependency of change. Therefore, mon-
itoring changes in the environment may be important.
•
Low dependency of change: The garden is loosely coupled to its environment
and the targeted change is of low complexity.
In situations where (or when) the coupling is low, and the change is not complex,
one could imagine that the changes would be relatively independent of the environ-
ment. Nevertheless, in complex changes (cf. Sect. 4.2), the transformations of kind
(or the increased probability of transitions to transformations of kind) may imply
changes in the relations with the environment which may implicate a different kind
of coupling. Therefore, there is still, to some degree, a relative dependence of the
change on the environment which calls for some attention.

Ecosystemic Demand for Gardening
4.9.1
Relation: Ecosystemic (In)dependency of Change  Complexity
of Environment
The ecosystemic (in)dependence of change offers an indication of how much the
gardener needs to attend to the characteristics of the environment, in its relation to the
garden, when aiming for a given type of change. The complexity of the environment
176
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

can be thought of as using the same relata as the complexity of the garden (cf. Sect.
4.2). Highly complex environments are likely to be adaptive and change through time
which may impact on the garden and its possibilities of change.
The relation of the ecosystemic (in)dependence of change to the degree of
complexity of the environment will provide us with indications of how much the
gardening needs to be integrative and include some gardening with/of the ecosystem
(or selected aspects of it). It will also provide an indicator of how much gardening
can be performed in a relatively focused way, with more or less attention dedicated
to monitoring the impact that the changes in the garden have on the environment or
vice versa.
4.9.2
Patterns of Ecosystemic Demand for Gardening
By comparing the complexity of the environment with the ecological (in)depen-
dency of change, we have abstracted four patterns or fuzzy prototypes of degree of
ecosystemic demand for gardening, as illustrated in Table 13.8.
The four patterns are deﬁned as follows:
•
High ecosystemic demand for gardening: The environment is highly complex
and there is a high ecological dependency of change, demanding an integrative
ecosystemic approach to gardening.
•
Moderate “watch garden”: The environment has low complexity but there is a
high ecological dependency for change. This suggests a focused approach to
gardening, as long as there is a monitoring of the ecosystemic (asymmetric)
changes in the garden, that may impact the environment (thus potentially chang-
ing the relevance of its complexity to the change process).
•
Moderate “watch environment”: The environment is complex and there is a
low ecological dependency for change. This suggests a focused approach to
gardening, as long as there is monitoring of ecosystemic (asymmetric) changes
in the environment, which may impact on the garden (thus potentially changing
the relevance of its complexity to the change process). For example, an assimi-
lation of the garden by the environment, if the garden is insufﬁciently complex to
match the environment’s complexity.
•
Low ecosystemic demand for gardening: The complexity of the targeted change
is low, and there is low ecological dependency, suggesting the suitability of a
focused approach to gardening without the need for high ecosystemic monitoring.

When the ecosystemic demand is high the gardener may need to develop artic-
ulated interventions that focus not just on the garden but also work on changes in its
environment and their relation. For example, a gardener may build a recreational
garden along a coastline while collaborating with local authorities to augment and
preserve the areas of dunes. This integrative intervention may be necessary to avoid
the degradation of the coastline while preserving the integrity and viability of the
new garden.
In the case of moderate demand, a gardener may wish to create a kitchen garden
near a wooded area, realising that there is no need for an integrative approach.
Nevertheless, the gardener may need to monitor the extent to which the garden is
unbalancing the ﬂora and fauna of the wood, e.g., due to pesticide runoff or an
imbalance, or a proliferation of non-native plants in the wood due to seed dispersion.

4.10
Gardener’s Ecosystemic Capacity
4.10.1
Relation: Theoretical Orientation to Ecosystemicity  Pragmatic
Capacity/Resourcefulness for Ecosystemicity
We previously discussed the gardener’s capacity for systemicity (theoretical and
pragmatic, cf. Sect. 4.3). Following what has been said about the need to include
the garden’s environment and the coupling of the garden with the environment
(ecosystemicity) in our preparation for gardening, we should expand the deﬁnition
of the gardener’s capacity to include their theoretical (or conceptual) ability to
understand the ecosystemic relations of the garden as well as the degree to which
the gardener has the resources, tools and techniques to act congruently with that
ecosystemic understanding.
(Ecosystemic) Pragmatic Capacity In this context, a necessary extension of the
gardener’s consideration of moderating relations is to the coupling of the garden to
its environment. An example of an ecosystemic moderation technique is safeguarding
system integrity through reinforcing system boundaries (or compartmentalisation).
There can be moderation of organism-plant coupling, for example, by reducing the
inﬂux of large “pests” (such as foxes, rabbits, birds, neighbouring children) through
the use of barriers or deterrents via mechanical means (e.g., fencing, netting, traps);
for small “pests” (such as insects or weeds) different mechanical barriers might be
used (e.g., polythene, mulch), or chemical measures (e.g., herbicides, insecticides) for
178
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

elimination or deterrence, which may also be used in combination with mechanical
extraction (e.g., hand, trowel, hoe, etc.).
A variant of the above is safeguarding system integrity through harnessing syner-
gistic system-environment interactions where measures are taken to harness
ecosystemic services to effect changes in the garden. For example using incentives
(such as water, food, shelter) to attract organisms (e.g., birds) that are natural predators
for “pests” (e.g., insects) in the garden.16
Another example is moderating environment-system interactions to promote
system operation/change. The moderating physical factors (e.g., moisture, air,
light, heat) of the environment in relation to garden elements can be used to promote
the introduction / establishment of new plants. This can be done through establishing
micro-environments (e.g., greenhouse (hothouse, cold frame), “cloche”, rock gar-
den, grow-bag, pot) or macro-environments (e.g., pond, wooded area, clearing),
through a combination of mechanical/ecological means.
4.10.2
Patterns of Gardener’s Ecosystemic Capacity
We extended the abstracted patterns of the gardener’s capacity (Sect. 4.3.1) to
include the consideration of ecosystemicity. The patterns are similar to the ones
presented in Table 13.2 for the gardener’s capacity.
The four patterns are deﬁned as follows:
•
High: The gardener is ecosystemically prepared and resourceful in that domain.
•
Moderate “Eco-pragmatic”: The gardener is ecosystemically unprepared but
resourceful to potentially intervene in that domain.
•
Moderate “Eco-theoretical”: The gardener is ecosystemically prepared but
unresourceful to intervene in that domain.
•
Low: The gardener is ecosystemically unprepared and an unresourceful gardener.
Invitations for Reﬂection
•
To what extent does the intervenor understand the relata of the system and
its environment and their characteristics? To what extent does the interve-
nor have models that afford an understanding of how the changes in the
system or the environment affect one another?
•
How much do the models, theories, hypotheses or ecosystemic understand-
ing of the intervenor allow them to understand the extent to which changes
in the system are ecosystemically supported and/or viable?
•
To what extent does the intervenor have the resources to effect the neces-
sary changes in a way that is congruent with the ecosystemic relations?
16We note that within the garden a similar ecological strategy is employed in Companion Planting:
proximal planting of different plants for synergistic effects that promote plant growth/health via
control of pests, pollination, etc. See, for example, Little (2008).

So far, we have addressed the gardener from different perspectives. By relating the
characteristics of the gardener’s contributions (systemic and ecosystemic capacity
and coupling stance), themselves representing other relations, we can identify differ-
ent proﬁles of gardeners that will interact in different ways with different gardens and
their ecologies, with different impact on the possibilities of change.

As we progress in the thinking process the different conﬁgurations of relationships
gain form, as more general patterns of gardening that have some correspondence
with “real world” gardening; see Fig. 13.4.
We abstracted 16 different proﬁles of gardeners by relating the gardener’s
systemic capacity and coupling stance, which we organised into 5 broad categories
and deﬁned, according to the following:

gardener’s ecosystemic capacity, we have a clearer idea of the gardener’s speciﬁc
contributions to the relations with the gardens and their ecologies. A gardener’s
ecosystemic proﬁle would indicate an additional ecosystemic capability. We have
not listed them to avoid a redundancy of terms, but they are considered below.
Gardeners Within Gardening Culture It is acknowledged that you cannot become
an effective gardener as a purely theoretical pursuit: you need practice to gain
experience. As a practitioner, there are various stages of development, such as the
archetypes: novice, amateur, professional and “expert” (or Master) gardener. Becom-
ing a Master may take decades of practice. Different types of garden (or gardening)
will have their own experts. Even a Master gardener is unlikely to have expertise that

Contemplating the Gardening: Constructing

5.1
Relation: Gardener’s (Eco-)systemic Proﬁle (Systemic

I appreciate the misunderstanding I have had with Nature over my perennial border. I think
it is a ﬂower garden; she thinks it is a meadow lacking grass, and tries to correct the error.
Sara Stein (2000)
The outcomes of gardening, as a complex activity, are emergent products of the
conﬁgurations of the relations involved. Thus they are associated with the congru-
ence (different degrees of ﬁt) of the properties of the different relations involved in
gardening. As Guerrero et al. (2015) state: “problems of ﬁt arise from challenges
related to the connectedness and interdependence between ecological and social
systems” and the “ability to effectively manage environmental change is contingent
on the degree to which a governance system ﬁts, or aligns with, the characteristics of
the biophysical system”.
17For example, Gardeners’ Question Time is a long-standing program on BBC Radio 4, where a
panel of experts provides advice on the audience’s gardening problems.

5.2
From Modelworld to Storyworld: Narratives
of Gardening
Using the relational framework, we have a way of developing different models of
interventions in complex systems. Each model corresponds to different conﬁgura-
tions of relations and/or their combination within the relational modelworld. Each
model supports the development of different narratives of change of a given complex
system, as their rich multi-level relationships lead to the emergence of contexts,
characters, actions, plots and timelines that constitute the basic elements of a
narrative. Thus the modelworld provides the basis for a storyworld.18 Narratives,
as natural communication devices, will assist in communicating the often difﬁcult
and counterintuitive issues relating to complex systems.
5.3
Evaluating the Fitness of Gardening: Fitness Landscapes
The narratives arising from the different models can be used for the evaluation of
interventions, as the ﬁtness of the model can be gauged with respect to different
types of outcomes. Thus, the models and their narratives can, on the one hand, guide
the planning and development of interventions and, on the other hand, guide their
evaluation.
Different categories of gardeners present different capacities and proﬁles that
make them more or less suited to manage the relationships underlying a range of
changes in the garden, from very simple to highly complex. The proﬁles of these
different gardeners (based on their systemic capacity and coupling stance) will
contribute in unique ways to the degree of systemic ﬁt of the focused gardening
activity.
Each category and type of gardener will be more or less suited to contribute
effectively and to support particular kinds of changes, as well as to deal with
unexpected events during the course of change. A poor ﬁt can result not in only in
a failure to achieve the proposed goals but also in unintended side effects that may
risk the integrity of the system and/or of its ecology.
We systematically related the gardener’s proﬁle (character(s)) with the complex-
ity of change (event), under different conditions (contexts) of ecosystemic demand
and ecosystemic capacity (ecosystemic proﬁle) for gardening (action), in order to
hypothesise about the degrees of ﬁt in terms of outcome (ﬁnale) of change (time) that
would result from the different conﬁgurations of relationships. Each conﬁguration of
relations supports the construction of different narratives. The emergent ﬁt of how
these different conﬁgurations of relations behave through time, in enacting a type of
change, can be represented graphically in what we call conceptual ﬁtness landscapes
18“the shared universe within which the settings, characters, objects, events, and actions of one or
more narratives exist” (von Stackelberg 2011).

(Pigliucci 2012). In Figs. 13.5, 13.6 and 13.7 we illustrate the different conceptual
ﬁtness landscapes that we have explored. We considered degrees of ﬁt varying from
positive ﬁt (optimal to sufﬁcient) and also negative (potentially harmful), consider-
ing that in some situations one could be inefﬁcient (cases of positive ﬁt, with a
potential excess of resources or capacities).
In cases of high complexity of change (Fig. 13.5a), the Professionals and the
Technical gardeners are the ones more likely to exhibit good ﬁt in gardening.
Although the Professor has theoretical capacity, and an adaptive coupling stance,
without resources they are unlikely to be able to support changes in the garden. By
contrast, the Tinkerer, although lacking the theoretical capacity for systemicity, has
resources or pragmatic capacity and is not only highly coupled with the system, but
also reﬂexive, which gives them the capacity to learn with the system, thereby
increasing their possibilities of a positive ﬁt.
However, in conditions of high ecological demand and high ecosystemic capacity
(Fig. 13.5b) the Professor, due to their knowledge of ecosystemicity and their
resourcefulness at this level, may, through indirect ecological interventions, be
capable of supporting the change in the system, therefore increasing ﬁt. On the
other hand, in these more difﬁcult conditions the Tinkerer’s more intuitive mode of
learning may not be sufﬁcient, except perhaps in situations where there is strong
coupling with the environment, which would allow them to learn through it. In that
case the ﬁt could be sufﬁcient. The Pseudo-gardeners (Philosopher and Apparatus)
are likely to cause damage due to their high resourcefulness being associated with
little knowledge and either low coupling or reﬂexivity, which inhibits their adaptive
capacity. Because the Professional is not reﬂexive, in situations of unexpected events
they may have more difﬁculties adjusting to them. Therefore, their ﬁtness is not as
high as that of the Master.
Due to the high ecological demand in cases of moderate ecosystem demand, but
“pragmatic” ecosystemicity capacity (Fig. 13.5c), the ﬁtness of the Master may
decrease. However, both the Master and the Professor, due to their reﬂexiveness and
coupling, may see their ﬁtness increase when they are also highly coupled with the
environment (which gives them an opportunity to develop knowledge by experi-
ence). The poor reﬂexiveness of the Engaged Practitioner and the poor coupling of
the Technicals limit the ﬁtness of their gardening.
In situations of high ecosystemic demand but moderate “theoretical” capacity
(Fig. 13.5d) the ﬁtness is signiﬁcantly reduced as the gardeners are limited in their
response to the demand of integrative ecosystemic interventions. Nevertheless, the
more reﬂexive and coupled gardeners, as long as they have systemic capacity, may
be able to use their knowledge regarding the systemic ﬁt between the garden and the
environment to support their change (e.g., by working with the garden so it induces
changes in the environment or working with the garden to minimize the impact of
factors that may impede change).
In situations of moderate ecosystemic demand but moderate capacity (Fig. 13.5e)
the degree of coupling of the gardener to the environment may be important, and act
as moderator of the ecosystemic ﬁt, as it may increase the degree of ﬁtness in cases of
environmental monitoring demand (“watch environment”) for most gardeners. In

cases of garden monitoring (“watch garden”) the Professionals will see an improve-
ment in their gardening. Beyond the speciﬁc conditions where the nature of coupling
was a relevant moderating factor, one should note that these relata are of overall
importance as they may determine the type of outcome. For example, although we
have indicated that the Apparatus Pseudo Gardener’s gardening ﬁt may be insufﬁ-
cient and harmful, to an extent which may depend on the nature of coupling, in cases
where there is low coupling from garden to garden, this risk may be decreased or the
potential harm lessened. Therefore, although the nature of coupling garden-to-envi-
ronment was not explicitly incorporated in lower levels of relating (cf. Fig. 13.3), it
was recruited at this higher level as a moderating dimension that creates particular
contexts for variations in ﬁt.
Figure 13.6 represents the conceptual landscapes of ﬁtness for conditions of
moderate complexity of change. For moderate complexity of change one can see
that Technicians have a better ﬁt than for high complex changes. Nevertheless, in
conditions of high ecosystemic demand, unless they are fully capable (theoretically
and pragmatically), the ﬁtness of their gardening will decrease. Even with moderate
changes, in conditions of high ecosystemic demand, whenever there is low capacity,
few gardeners will achieve satisfactory ﬁts.
In some cases, particularly in maintenance-type changes (cf. Sect. 13.4.2.1),
Eager Apprentices may achieve a sufﬁcient ﬁt, since their reﬂexivity and high
coupling may help them learn enough about a system to contribute to its mainte-
nance. As indicated by the frame in Fig. 13.6d, e there are situations where the nature
of coupling gardener-garden or gardener-environment will moderate (increasing or
decreasing) the ﬁtness of gardening. For example, in situations of “Watch garden” or
“Watch environment” the nature of those couplings are of special relevance as they
will constitute important resources that allow gardening to be developed with a main
focus on the garden while attempting to minimize risks and optimise outcomes.
In Fig. 13.7 it is possible to see that for changes of low complexity of change
(requiring only low routine maintenance) several proﬁles can achieve minimally
satisfactory ﬁts. However, some will continue to present risks of harm when there is
either low coupling, or low reﬂexivity, low theoretical capacity and high resource-
fulness. In situations of high ecosystemic demand and low capacity, even if the
change is simple there is a relevant decrease of ﬁt for most gardeners. The ones with
most integrative proﬁles are the only ones that will be able to achieve good levels of
ﬁt, through their ability to keep close with the garden’s transformations and
adapting. We have not explored other scenarios for low complexity of change as
they seem less relevant in these conditions.
Consequences of Poor Fit (“Side-Effects”) There are many examples of poor ﬁt for
gardening, in terms of unintended side effects, for example:
•
Pesticides may pass up through the food chain and accumulate in higher organ-
isms, causing wider health issues, e.g., Carson (2002).
•
Single varieties for production yield (“monoculture”), leading to vulnerabilities to
particular diseases/pests, e.g., Zhu et al. (2000).
188
L. Caves and A. T. de Melo

•
Invasive species: Alien plants introduced into new environment may outgrow
(outcompete) native species and proliferate, e.g., Lockwood et al. (2013).
•
Over fertilisation of soil on crop species, leading to stress to neighbouring trees
(Nosengo 2003).
•
Flowers bred for appearance/colour, leading to loss of scent (Rohwer 2010)
Invitations for Reﬂection

To what extent is the intervenor’s proﬁle adequate considering the targeted

Tending the Gardening: Improving the Ecosystemic
Fitness
A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic
community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise. (Leopold 1949)
We have explored how conﬁgurations of relations that correspond to different
ways of gardening are likely to lead to different levels of ﬁtness and corresponding
outcomes. The questions now are: How satisfactory is the level of ﬁt likely to be
achieved with the current conﬁguration? What are the likely outcomes and their
implications?
Although we were able to identify broad categories of styles or approaches to
gardening, and identify the relations that sustain them, the fact is that these relations
(and their corresponding relata) are dynamic, therefore, subject to inﬂuence, both
within and between levels. There is opportunity, and certainly need, for a continual
evaluation and adjustment of gardening towards a better ﬁt and more satisfactory
outcomes.
Having explored the emergent properties of gardening and pondering the possible
outcomes, we may want to re-enter the relational structure and explore its relations at
different levels, looking for possibilities of change. Below we leave the reader with
some additional invitations for a recursive reﬂection focused on exploring possibil-
ities of change in the relations that build gardening.

Invitations for Recursive Reflection
Time and Complexity of Change
•
Would a different level or type or change be acceptable or reasonable?
•
Can the goals be redeﬁned or adjusted in time (e.g., give time for capacity
to develop, until aiming for the ﬁnal goals while working on intermediate
goals/changes)? Can different levels of complexity of change be operated
sequentially or concurrently?
Intervenor’s Capacity
•
Can we learn more about the speciﬁc internal structure and dynamics of the
intervention? What actions can be implemented to produce speciﬁc infor-
mation about the intervenor’s (eco)systemicity? In what timescales? Can the
intervenor’s theoretical orientation to (eco)systemicity be improved? Can
the intervenor’s available resources be used in a way that is more congruent
with the system’s (eco)systemicity? Can the intervenor’s resources to inter-
vene in regard to the ecosystemicity of the system be increased?
Couplings and Coupling Stance
•
Can the intervenor increase the strength of the coupling with the garden?
What interfaces or sources of information could support that?
•
To which systems can the intervenor couple to in order to indirectly inﬂuence
the garden, particularly in cases of low intervenor-to-system? Which external
systems in the environment are more susceptible to the intervenor’s inﬂuence?
•
What kind of strategies are available to increase the intervenor’s reﬂexivity
(e.g., supervision; use of reﬂection diaries; reﬂecting peer dialogues;
teaching)?
Ecosystemicity
•
What other interventions are available or could be devised that meet the
level of demand for ecosystemicity? What more can be explored about the
natural ecological processes connecting the system with its environment
and the relations within the environment that could inspire the development
of novel integrative interventions?
•
What new thinking strategies can be developed that are congruent with the
natural complexity of the system and its ecology?
Ecosystemic Fit
•
How could the systemic ﬁts for different intervenors complement each other in
a team through time? Could that complementarity be concurrent or sequential?
How viable is it to increase the ﬁt of intervention with the available intervenors
for a given timescale? How can the process of change be staged in relation to
the intervenor’s proﬁle?

As meta-observers, we have been gardening by adopting a meta-position on the
whole of the relations, in order to identify opportunities to facilitate changes in the
relata and in the relations from which they emerge. At this point the questions are: At
what level of the conﬁguration of relationships can changes be made? What are the
relata (and relations) that are more susceptible to change? Where would changes
have a bigger impact and to what extent do changes in one relatum contribute to
adjustment in others? These are core questions for the type of meta-reﬂection needed
for the improvement in our capacity to understand and expand our possibilities of
action in relation to complex systems.

Harvesting the Gardening: Discussion
All models are wrong, some are useful. (Box 1979)
7.1
Introduction
We have explored the use of gardening, as an exemplar, to organise, in a relational
way, relevant information regarding the management of change in complex systems.
We acknowledge that gardening has been widely used as a perspective for exploring
the world across individual, social and global levels (Marcus 1992; Cooper 2006;
Pollan 2007).
We have explored gardening not just by adopting the lens of relational and
systemic thinking (Bateson 1979; von Foerster 2007), but also by using gardening
as a guide in developing a practice of complex thinking (Kaufmann 2000; Bar-Yam
2004; Morin 2005, 2008). The relational scheme in which we grounded our thinking,
combined with the richness of the gardening culture, allowed us to approach the
issue of change in complex systems in a way that builds insight and offers clues for
practice. We used gardening, in a circular and recursive way, as both our starting and
end points: as both the exemplar that organised the thinking, and the domain in
which we applied the relational thinking framework. The framework is not a model
of how to manage complex systems, it is a metamodel (Andrews et al. 2011), one
that allows for a modelling of how different models of change may be constructed
and evaluated in the face of complexity (Patton 2011). In this sense, the framework
represents a gardening of gardening.
Figure 13.8 illustrates the steps taken in this chapter from the development of a
relational framework for complex systems to its application to the domain of
gardening and construction of a relational modelworld. From this modelworld
13

different models can be built and tested using different methodologies.19 The
different models can also be organised in the form of narratives, which may be
prospective or retrospective narratives of the unfolding of change in real cases, or
narratives of hypothetical models that can be generated and tested using methods
such as simulation. The framework and its application have created favourable
conditions for the development of case-based research (Byrne and Ragin 2009),
and case study evaluations (Patton 2011) where different types of models can be
applied and tested, developing or reﬁning the ﬁtness landscapes for a particular
system or class of systems.
7.2
From Exemplar to Metaphor?
Pragmatically, the extent to which the gardening exemplar is successful depends
upon its utility. We believe the abstractions and schema we have employed can be
used in different domains, with different kinds of complex systems. By developing a
framework, adopting a relational perspective, and by using concepts through an
exemplar of a widely understood domain, we hope that it will be effective in
scaffolding interdisciplinarity dialogue, and that by relating our different gardenings,
we can expand the possibilities of understanding and action that emerge in our
complex world. Further, we believe the application of our framework, along with the
generality of the concepts, creates conditions for the use of gardening as a useful
metaphor20 for managing and communicating about changes in complex systems.

19We do not prescribe methodologies: although we have referred to qualitative methods, the
modelworld could be used as the basis to build other kinds of models, e.g., computational models.
20Burke (1941) positioned metaphor as one of the “Four Great Tropes” alongside metonymy,
synecdoche and irony. He noted “Give a man but one of them, tell him to exploit its possibilities,
and if he is thorough in doing so, he will come upon the other three.” We trust the reader will excuse
this eventuality.

7.3
General and Restricted Gardening
The ﬁeld of complexity has been divided into restricted complexity and general
complexity by Morin (2007). A restricted complexity approach assumes a more
strategic stance, neglecting the understanding of organisation and complex thinking,
seeking (by “decomplexifying”) to simplify the complex and search for general laws.
A generalised complexity approach is concerned with the nature of the complex
system in terms of its eco-systemic relational organisation and how we can know
about it. Generalised complexity recognises opposites and differences and seeks to
relate them. We hope our gardening-inspired framework is a positive contribution
towards expanding a general complexity approach to study change in complex
systems.
On the other hand, we could use the distinction between restricted and general
complexity to classify gardening as an activity to promote change. Restricted
gardening would seek some changes and focus on the technical aspects of the
manipulation of the system and their interactions without a deep understanding of
the processes involved and the nature of the conﬁgurations of relationships impli-
cated in its maintenance and transformation. This would be the approach of some
technical gardeners. Although useful in some cases it is a limited approach. A
generalised gardening is one at the level of the professional gardeners and it may,
of course, involve dimensions of a restricted gardening, but have a wider focus on
understanding the nature of their relations within the system and with its ecology,
and what they imply.
7.4
A Complex Web of Mutual Inﬂuence
In building our approach we considered several relata and the ways in which they
relate through a build-up of relations (and relations of relations) at multiple
interconnected levels. At each level, new concepts and forms of understanding
emerge that recursively feed each other. In this sense, there is no privileged level
of consideration or straightforward causal relationships (Macy 1991; Noble 2012),
and the mutual inﬂuence of the conﬁguration of relations is not meaningfully
reducible through analysis.
7.5
The Ethics of Gardening
Huxley (1894) used gardening as an analogy for man’s capacity to create gardens
(a “State of Art”) within the “cosmic process” (the “State of Nature”). In focusing on
social systems he raised ethical issues about how this can be achieved, something
that within the scope of this chapter we have not addressed. Nevertheless, our
13

193

explicit inclusion of reﬂexivity opens the way to a consideration of the ethical
dimensions of affecting change.
7.6
Complex Thinking for Complex Systems
Our recursive relational framework reﬂects many of the known properties of com-
plex systems (Dent 1999). We note that other thinking approaches have been
presented that also embrace both relationality and emergence, as well as reﬂexivity,
to discover and exploit system synergies (Chenail 1995; Tsoukas and Hatch 2001;
Friedman 2011; Ravetz 2014). We hope this relational framework represents a
contribution towards building novel patterns of complex thinking (Morin 1992).
We look forward to the blossoming of complex thinking.

Gardening:

for
Complex Thinking about Complex Systems.”
RW:
I’m not sure I know (yet) what complex narratives are, or how they might
function as pragmatic tools. I’m also unclear about the concept of storyworld
evoked, and about the sense in which it is “enacted” through narrative. All
this might prove very interesting, but I think it needs pressing beyond the
immediately apparent sense of these ideas.
LC:
You ask good questions, that require various degrees of unpacking:
modelworld: the relational thinking process applied to a domain results in
conﬁgurations
of
relations

from
the
base
relata.
The
conﬁgurations reﬂect higher order entities (e.g., relating to types of
gardener, or types of change, etc.) that could form the basis of a particular
model of the change process. So the process is really a model of how to build
models (a metamodel), and thus the models produced constitute a world of
models (modelworld) constructed from different ways of looking at relations. I
also note that a particular conﬁguration of relationships, albeit a model in its
own right, can also be regarded as a framework for more detailed models.

process can have particular attributes (e.g., types of gardener, types of

change) and may be regarded as characters or settings that (necessarily)
relate to each other. These characters, settings and change scenarios
constitute
a
storyworld,
from
which
particular
narratives
can
be
constructed, i.e., individual trajectories through the relational world. In this
way, the potential of the characters and their settings is “enacted” through
particular individual narrative trajectories. They may be termed “complex
narratives” because they arise from, and reﬂect the characteristics of, a
complex thinking process that captures the multi-level relational structure
of the complex change scenario and therefore (if carefully constructed)
should retain some of its “complexity.”
That’s the general conception. It may well need reﬁnement.
RW:
That’s interesting, and I think I can see some of the potential in it. One
immediate point worth bringing to your attention is that the term storyworld
already exists in narratology with a somewhat different sense (there, it is the
“world” produced or implied by a given narrative). I don’t much like the
concept, and I’m keen myself to think about these matters differently, but
there is the potential for terminological confusion for narratologists
reading this.
LC:
My thought was that the storyworld once constructed affords different
narratives. Thus I may have ignored its genesis, but thought I had captured
its utility... If it is a real no-no, then perhaps we need to adjust the
terminology.
AM:
Or maybe clarify?
LC:
The joys of interdisciplinary working...
AM:
Our storyworld is the world that appears as constructed by particular settings,
actions, characters. A world that is portrayed or constructed in that narrative.
There is always an underlying narrative but to some extent it can remain in a
potential state waiting to be narrated in full detail or exist in different
versions.
We could say that there may not be a storyworld without narrative, but we
can also say that to some extent it can exist as a sort of proto-narrative
(I think this is more how we approach it): the elements are there for the
construction of a narrative but it needs to be realised and it can be realised
with different nuances?
RW:
The source for the meaning of “storyworld” in your chapter (von
Stackelberg) is rather heterodox; the standard meaning of the term derives
from Herman (2004). The deﬁnition from von Stackelberg is also
problematic in certain respects (see below), I think, even though it licenses
your usage for the purposes of the chapter.
I need to explain my response here in three stages: (1) How the narratological
concept of storyworld differs from the one proposed in your chapter; (2) Why I
think the narratological concept is ﬂawed; (3) Whether there is an alternative
way of conceiving the idea of concern for this chapter, and for the prospect of
narrating complexity.
198
L. Caves et al.

(1) A story is a representation; it makes sense of its subject matter by
giving narrative form to it. The form is not an inherent feature of the subject
matter. A storyworld, in the narratological sense, is the product or effect of a
particular story. It results from interpretation of the narrative discourse. It
doesn’t pre-exist the story as such, and the story only refers to it in the sense
that it produces what it refers to. (It helps, perhaps, to bear in mind that the
concept originates in the context of ﬁctional stories).
(2) It’s a confused and confusing concept, because it equivocates between
the referential priority of “world” and the discursive priority of “story” It wants
to ground story in a referent (a world), while at the same time retaining the form
of story, which is a feature of the discourse but seems, in this term, to become a
feature of the referent. The notion of proto-narrative actually captures the
equivocation nicely: in what does the narrative quality of proto-narrative
consist? Does the term merely refer to something of which we make
narrative sense—i.e., simply, a feature of the world; or does it refer to
something which already has the shape of a narrative—i.e., simply, a
narrative (bearing in mind that narrative representations come in assorted
media, including mental representations; and that any narrative may be
re-narrated and re-mediated in multiple versions).
(3) The striking difference in the usage of “storyworld” in your chapter, if
I understand it right, is that it wants to conceive of the concept (by analogy
with “modelworld”) as a kind of repository of multiple possible stories, a
world of stories. I would want to say that such a notion, to be intelligible,
needs to be framed as itself representational, not just as the raw material for
(narrative) representations. That suggests to me the possibility that there
might be a closer connection than you currently envisage between
storyworld in this sense and at least one possible sense of “complex
narrative.” I’m certainly keen to think further about what “complex
narrative” might be!
LC:
Regarding (3) I think that the creation of the modelworld, which through
interpretation as characters/settings is the basis of the storyworld, is itself a
kind of narrative exercise. It is arrived at through a recursive relational
process that involves the sense-making of the meta-observer—building a
story that offers insight.
The muddying of referent and discourse is an encouraging sign for a
reﬂexive process and appeals to the constructivist stance that Ana and I hold.

The Software Garden
Julian F. Miller
Abstract It is commonplace for human beings to manipulate and control systems
that they only understand at a behavioural level. Yet we expect software engineers to
build software systems by assembling instructions that are extremely fragile and
require extremely precise understanding of how these instructions interact. We argue
that such a method of programming computers will not scale to future demand. We
suggest that future software might proﬁtably be constructed using a horticulture-
inspired programming methodology. Evolved software seeds will be planted and
shaped in software gardens for desired computational behaviour.

Introduction
It is self-evident that human beings routinely shape, alter and interact with systems
that they have little detailed or precise understanding of. Indeed, many of these
systems are not merely complicated systems but truly complex systems.1 In human
society examples of these interactions are plentiful. In fact, it is easy to argue that
such interactions form the vast majority of all interactions between human beings
and the physical world. We can give many concrete examples of such interactions:
trading stocks and shares, animal husbandry, horticulture, sculpture, carpentry,
choral singing, writing. Interactions between humans and the physical world
which require precise and detailed knowledge have emerged relatively recently in
human history. We know this as the development of science. Indeed, so successful
has this approach been that it has transformed human society within a few hundred

1Complicated systems often have many parts that interact through precisely deﬁned interactions.
They are engineered using top-down design and analysis. On the other hand, complex systems
typically have many parts interacting with each other through numerous and often poorly deﬁned
mechanisms. They show sensitivity to external environments and exhibit collective behaviour and
organization, often at multiple levels of abstraction.

years. For instance, physicists and engineers have learned how to manipulate silicon
at such an exquisite level of detail that devices could be constructed that operate at an
almost symbolic logical level at enormous speed. This has led to the development of
computers and in turn the internet. However, at present to program computers
requires humans to construct structures at an extraordinary level of precision. Such
programs are extremely fragile and require humans to consciously and deliberately
write thousands of instructions to achieve a desired outcome.
2
The Complexity Ceiling
We argue that there must be a natural limit to the size and complexity of human
produced computer programs. We call this the complexity ceiling. Jaron Lanier, the
pioneer of Virtual Reality, saw in 2003 that the complexity ceiling would be a
fundamental problem (Lanier 2003):
Since the complexity of software is currently limited by the ability of human engineers to
explicitly analyze and manage it, we can be said to have already reached the complexity
ceiling of software as we know it. If we don’t ﬁnd a different way of thinking about and
creating software, we will not be writing programs bigger than about 10 million lines of
code, no matter how fast, plentiful or exotic our processors become.
Well, he underestimated human ingenuity and since then software systems have
continued to grow . . .
Software complexity is crudely measured in counts of lines of code. The list
below gives an indication of how many lines of code modern software systems have
(McCandless 2014):
•
Linux 3.1: 15 million
•
Windows 7: 40 million
•
Microsoft Ofﬁce 2013: 45 million
•
Large Hadron Collider (total software): 50 million
•
Mac OS X “Tiger”: 85 million
•
Average modern high end car: 100 million
It is important to realise that some of these software systems are effectively
separate software packages that have some interaction. This explains why an average
modern high end car has more lines of code in its software than the Microsoft
Windows 7 operating system. It also calls into question a line of code as a useful
measure of software complexity. However, lines of code are directly related to human
effort.
Linus Torvald, the pioneering developer of the Linux operating system echoed
some of Lanier’s concerns and in 2011 he complained that Linux has become “too
complex” and he was concerned that developers would not be would not be able to
understand the software anymore. He said he was “afraid of the day” when an error
occurs that “cannot be evaluated anymore” (Kehrer 2011). This brings us to an
important question that is at the heart of this chapter:
202
J. F. Miller

Is there an upper limit to the number of lines of code in a useful piece of software that can be
produced by human beings?
In Fred Brook’s classic book The Mythical Man-Month he asserts that program-
mers produce about 10 good lines of code per day (Brooks 1995).2 Let us now make
some outrageous approximations. The current number of software programmers in
the world has been estimated as approximately 19 million (Hilwa 2014). Assume that
all these software engineers are working on the same software project. Clearly, this
would be an enormous undertaking and would for many reasons be infeasible.
However, if this were possible then 190 million good lines of code could be produced
per day. Imagining that a single program with this number of lines of good code could
actually function is wildly optimistic for many reasons. Lehman noted (Lehman and
Ramil 2002)
In every piece of real world software, there are embedded an unbounded number of
assumptions. Most of the assumptions are not decisions that you have taken, but things
that you have not thought about
Let us compare and contrast this with living systems and in particular a pear tree. It
has been calculated that the single mature leaf of a pear tree has 50 million cells, while
the entire tree has approximately 15,000 million cells (Stern 1999, p. 3). This is
150 times the number of lines of code in an average high-end car. The number of cells
in an adult human body is estimated to be 1014. So there are a million times more cells
in the human body than in the largest software systems thus far constructed. A cell is
an enormously complex entity itself, so equating cells to lines of code makes our
argument
heavily
biased
toward
human
designed
programs
(i.e.,
grossly
underestimating biological complexity). In addition, living organisms are in a con-
stant state of change and yet they maintain their overall function. For instance, in the
human body it is estimated that 300 million cells die and are replaced every minute
(Center for Disease Control 2013). Human engineered software resides in computer
memory and if an error occurs a human being is required to re-install or re-load the
software, or even replace the memory (i.e., it is very fragile).
How long would it take all the software engineers on the planet to produce a piece
of software with the same number of lines of code as there are cells in a human body?
The answer (using the previously discussed assumptions) is 14,500 years. Clearly
there is something very special happening in biology. It implies that there ought to be
another way of programming complex systems. We suggest that this methodology
should not require programmers to work at the level of logical instructions, but at a
much higher level. We suggest that this level should produce computation at a visual
(or sensory) level by combining visual computational elements that always perform
some form of useful computation that can shaped via visual (sensory) indicators of
the computation taking place. There is a form of computing called Visual Computing
2A more recent book has reconﬁrmed this as a good estimate in more recent software projects (Jones
and Bonsignour 2011).

where computer scientists have tried to create a programming methodology rather
like this. We discuss this next.

Visual Programming
3.1
Introduction
Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow programmers to create programs by
manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.
VPL is also known as dataﬂow or diagrammatic programming. There are a large number
of VPLs. One important characteristic of most VPLs is that syntax errors are impossible.
The user is only allowed to manipulate graphical elements in a constrained way.
The ﬁrst so-called VPL, LOGO (Papert 1980), was created in 1967 by Daniel
G. Bobrow, Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon. The language
included movement commands for a simple drawing “robot” called a turtle. However,
the complete LOGO language is actually a dialect of the AI functional programming
language LISP (McCarthy 1960, 1962).
3.2
Scratch
Scratch is a recently created VPL (Resnick et al. 2009) in which different visual
blocks can be snapped together rather like puzzle pieces. The programming con-
structs are shaped so that they can only accept other constructs. Figure 15.1 shows a
simple example of a Scratch program.3
In the development environment there is a programming area where the pieces
are put together and an executable area where the program outputs are displayed.
Usually programs control animated characters or shapes (which the user or program-
mer has previously created). Figure 15.2 shows the Scratch development environ-
ment for the crab program. When the “When clicked” piece is clicked, the crab in the
executable area moves around a little at random.
The programming area acts rather like the ﬂoor of a child’s playroom where Lego
bricks have been used on a number of projects. The user clicks on a stack of
programming pieces and this causes the execution of the program. Scratch users
mainly involve children between the ages of 8 and 16, though as Resnick notes, a
sizeable group of adults also participate (Resnick et al. 2009).

LabView
Engineers are already using forms of visual programming. LabView4 is a well-
established VPL that is used by engineers to build mixed software and hardware
systems, including analysis and data acquisition, instrument control, embedded
control and monitoring, and automated test and validation systems. LabView uses
a visual programming language called G. G is a dataﬂow programming language in

which the programmer draws, places and connects visual nodes icons together. The
connections between these nodes propagate data. Nodes start executing as soon as
they have their required data. Users build programs by dragging and dropping virtual
instruments. However, building complex algorithms or large programs still requires
detailed and extensive knowledge of the syntax behind LabView and its memory
management. This means it is more like a visually assisted conventional program-
ming system. An example of a LabView program and output5 is shown in Fig. 15.3.

Nature’s Way of Programming
Complex living systems are self-constructed. Single celled organisms replicate
themselves and form vast collections that achieve global ‘goals’ that are emergent
from the interactions between the cells and the environment in which they live. A
classic organism in this regard is slime mould (Bonner 2009). This organism
undergoes distinct and dramatic developmental stages:

•
amoebae: the cells are isolated and feed in isolation
•
aggregation: when the food supply is exhausted the cells come together
•
slug-like: the aggregated cells form a single creature that is capable of movement
•
stalking: the cells rise up from the ground and form a stalk
•
fruiting: the stalk produces a head which bears spores
•
spore-dispersion: The spores are dispersed on the ground and hatch into amoebae
Multicellular organisms are built via the process of biological development in
which a single event, the fertilisation of an ovum, begins a process in which cells
replicate in parallel and eventually differentiate into specialist cells which co-operate
in the production of a huge collection of cells. This constitutes the body of the
organism. Organisms continually change during their lifetime and yet largely main-
tain their basic functionality.
Let us compare how organisms are ‘programmed’ with how computer programs are
produced. Cells contain information storage mainly in the form of a sequence of base-
pairs on a double-stranded DNA molecule. Collections of these bases form genes.
Many cells contain collections of DNA molecules called chromosomes. One can think
of the genes as analogous to the instructions in a computer program. The genotype (the
collection of chromosomes) can be regarded as the program for a cell (Miller and
Banzhaf 2003). The cell is an enormously complex entity. The bacterium E. Coli has
the following components (Harold 2001). There are about 2,400,000 protein mole-
cules (of 1850 varieties), 1400 mRNA molecules (600 varieties), 200,000 tRNA
molecules (60 varieties), 20,000 ribosomes, and 2.1 DNA molecules. This list con-
tinues. The recently decoded 4,639,221 base-pair genome has 4289 protein-coding
genes (Passarge 2013). Biological programs are made of this basic unit.
Human beings do not create programs from a module or entity of the complexity
of a cell. Indeed, many engineers and scientists would abhor the construction of
anything in which the atomic unit was anything that complex. Despite this we argue
that to break through the complexity ceiling we will need a software equivalent of a
cell. We think a good analogy to the software construction methodology of the future
is horticulture. We call it the software garden. We discuss this next.
5
A Horticultural Analogy for Programming
5.1
Introduction
In horticulture, as in many other human activities, humans manipulate complex
systems to produce desired outcomes. We manipulate plants in a variety of ways,
for instance, by pruning, fertilising, spraying, training, grafting and breeding.
Although recently plants have been manipulated at a genetic level, the majority of
interactions between human beings and plants are phenotypic in nature.
We believe that it is useful and apposite to compare the way plants are manipu-
lated with the way computer programs are constructed.
15

5.2
Example: An Evolved Developmental Approach
to Creating Virtual Organisms
A convenient computational environment where virtual plants and other organisms
can be studied and manipulated is cellular automata (CA) (Ilachinski 2001). They
were invented by John von Neumann and Stanlislaw Ulam (Ulam 1952; von
Neumann 1951). In CA, the world consists of cells obeying rules that depend on
their discrete state and the states of their neighbours. By creating several CA maps
one can simulate both the cells themselves and chemicals that interact with the cells.
The chemical CAs obeyed a simple diffusion law. Miller used these ideas together
with a technique called Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to represent and
evolve cellular programs in which “organisms” can develop from a single cell
(Miller 2004). He showed that it was possible to evolve programs which caused
the organisms to take on the appearance of various desired shapes (e.g., plant-like
structures and national ﬂags). Interestingly, the organisms could achieve stasis
(or maturity), but when an alteration was made, the organism responded by repairing
itself and in many cases eventually achieved stasis again. This characteristic was
observed in a number of virtual organisms and was not explicitly rewarded by the
ﬁtness function used (i.e., it was emergent). Figure 15.4 shows a cellular program
that when run develops into a French ﬂag which subsequently stops growing.
Although the French ﬂag organism achieves stasis, the individual cells each
executing the same program are highly active. Indeed, the organism is in a constant
state of rebuilding itself. This means that if the organism is damaged a dynamic
period of activity starts up again until the organism becomes a French ﬂag again.
This is shown in Figs. 15.5 and 15.6. This behaviour is reminiscent of autonomous
regeneration of the pond organism hydra, which can reform itself when its cells are
dissociated and then reaggregated (Bosch 2007; Gierer et al. 1972).
The grafting of two different virtual organisms was demonstrated in (Miller and
Thomson 2004). Figures 15.7 and 15.8 show the development of two German ﬂag
organisms.
At iteration 11 the ﬂags were divided and joined together, so that on the left half of
the German ﬂag organisms were made of cells from organism 11 (Gf11) and the right
half were made of cells from organism 0 (Gf0). When a particular cell program decides
to grow it replicates its own genotype. Figure 15.9 shows the locations of the two types
of cells (top) and the phenotype of the grafted organism (bottom). In the former the
black region indicates the locations of Gf11 cells and the red region the gGf0 cells. The
graft behaves in a stable way, with each genotype dominating on each side of the hybrid
organism and mixing taking place in the region around the graft site.

In another example, plant-like organisms were evolved (Figs. 15.10 and 15.11).
The organisms were grafted at iteration 11. Figure 15.12 shows both the location of
cell types (red indicates cells belonging to organism gp13 while green indicates cells
belonging to gp9).

The Software Garden
The software garden refers to a proposed visual developmental programming in which
truly complex software is constructed by the manipulation of evolved computational
developmental organisms. It is suggested that programmers of the future will manip-
ulate (i.e., ‘program’) complex software by manipulating the behaviour of software,
using operations that are analogous to those used by horticulturists. This form of
programming will be more like a narrative. It will involve multiple parallel interactions
with the software on multiple levels. Software will change in response to these
interactions and new functionality will emerge rather than being engineered by design.

J. F. Miller

Human ‘programmers’ will observe the computational behaviour of constructed
systems through a number of visual or other sensory indicators of software function
and they will carry out phenotypic manipulation so that the desired computational
behaviour is more closely obtained. As we saw this is rather like how Scratch
programs are constructed to manipulate animated characters. In the examples of
growing ﬂags and plants the objective is visual rather than computational, however
we see no reason why computational behaviours could not be represented through
visual indicators (or visualizations).
In addition, we foresee that computer scientists will create computational ‘seed
libraries’ which when planted in the appropriate computational environment will
grow and develop towards certain desired computational behaviours. Analogues of
many of the actions that horticulturalists perform will be created, including grafting,
pruning, fertilizing, training, etc. This will allow computational systems to be
programmed without the high-level programmer being aware of the internal com-
putational mechanisms within the computational cells. We have seen by some
simple examples that computational organisms can be evolved, they can repair
themselves, achieve maturity, and be grafted.

Chapter 16
Emergent Causality in Complex Films
and Complex Systems
Maria Poulaki
Abstract This chapter explores the complex dynamics of causality in narrative. I
show that approaching the study of narrative through a complex systems framework
allows us to see narrative causality as a product of dynamic transformation occurring
through the interaction of causal elements connecting the intra- and extra-diegetic
levels. Exploring the properties of emergence, nonlinearity and feedback in complex
systems and complex narratives, with a particular focus on complex ﬁlms, the
chapter suggests an agent-based approach to narrative to capture the dynamics of
transformation taking place in-between micro, meso and macro narrative levels,
connecting the macro-causal, formal dynamics, to the micro-interactions of agents.
1
Narrative and the Principle of Causality
Causality, the way that recipients interpret narrative events as relating to each other in
sequences of causes and effects (Kafalenos 2006, p. viii), is the driving force of
narrative. As Edward Branigan characteristically declares: “If I were forced to use a
single word to characterize a narrative organization of data, that word would be
‘causality’. Creating time and place in a narrative is not as important as constructing a
possible logic for the events that occur” (Branigan 1992, p. 216). The deﬁnition of
narrative that he suggests is “a way of organizing spatial and temporal data into a
cause-effect chain of events with a beginning, middle, and end that embodies a
judgement about the nature of the events as well as demonstrates how it is possible
to know, and hence to narrate, the events” (p. 3).
Narrative texts prompt recipients to formulate various causal interpretations. The
function of narrative causality presupposes diegetic and character-based action, and
the changes brought by it. Literary theorist Didier Coste points out the association of
narrative with “‘action’ or ‘making’, if not with causality” (Coste 1989, p. 42).
Although narrative causality can be distinguished and acquire different forms from

the intra-diegetic micro-causal level to the structural or ‘macro’ diegetic causal level,
and also the extra-diegetic level of the recipient’s interpretation, the most common
conception of narrative causality is the one generated by the causal power of agents in
the diegetic world. Causality in narratives operates through agents—actors or
“actants”—and the “functions” they perform. According to Mieke Bal, as long as
stories are constructions made by humans, involving human characters and addressed
to humans, they are based on “the presupposition that human thinking and action is
directed towards an aim” (Bal 1985, p. 26). Causal action is carried by agents and is
most of the times oriented towards a goal. The association of causality with mean-
ingful action is so widespread that many narratologists distinguish between narrative
and other forms of texts in which causal connections through actions are not
prevailing, for example descriptive passages. Narrative is a teleological construction,
demanding a subject and its “will to execute his or her program” (Bal 1985, p. 33).
Such “will” provides the story with the necessary energy in order for it to unfold in
time. As long as we think of agency in narratives as a goal-directed activity, it is
difﬁcult to detach it from cause and effect chains at the micro-diegetic level, that of
characters’ actions.
Although characters are always causal agents, the actions that drive a narrative’s
causality are not always character-driven. Bal distinguishes between actors and
classes of actors (actants) and distinctive characters in narrative texts. The former
two might also be inanimate and their role is structural (always related to the overall
teleology of the fabula), while the latter correspond to human beings, and from the
semiological point of view, they consist in semantic units (Bal 1985, p. 79). The
actantial model was introduced in narrative theory by semiotician Algirdas-Julien
Greimas, who in turn borrowed the term “actant” from the linguist Lucien Tesnière.
Actants may be deﬁned as “names of roles” (Coste 1989, p. 135). The notion of
actant, also becoming inﬂuential in social theory through “actor-network theory”,
suggests a step beyond the micro-diegetic level, by adopting a transindividual
perspective. It is also helpful in order to conceive of larger patterns of causality
involved in narratives, although even this notion of actant does not escape some
degree of anthropomorphism. For instance, among the examples of actants that Bal
provides are “The old people”, “The Marxists”, etc. (Bal 1985, p. 27).
What I describe as two different kinds of causal analysis in narratives, namely the
analysis at the micro-diegetic level of causality (of actors) or the macro-diegetic level
(of actants), correspond to different models of narrative analysis. According to ﬁlm
theorist Thomas Elsaesser, on the one hand “the Aristotelian model [by comparison
to the structuralist model] seems to stress overall unity (of time, place, and action),
rather than segmentation. It also centres on characters as initiating agents rather than
on interpersonal transactions (functions) as the core elements of narrative” (Elsaesser
and Buckland 2002, p. 30; my emphasis). On the other hand, the structuralist and
poststructuralist model of characters and causality is “functionalist and relations-
based, essentially a-causal and instead more complexly ‘logical’ and ‘semantic’.”
(Elsaesser and Buckland 2002, p. 37).
I would argue that narrative causality cannot be conceived on any of these levels
alone, but operates across levels and connects them in a dynamic and, as will shortly
214

be discussed, emergent way. I would argue that neither the Aristotelian model alone
nor the structuralist one can capture the dynamics linking the micro-level of char-
acterological action to the macro-level of narrative structure. In what follows I
suggest a complex systemic approach to narrative causality, which would be able
to capture the complex dynamic interplay of these levels.
2
Causality and Transformation
Narrative theory is not incompatible with complex systems theory. One classical
narratological model that is particularly interesting in this respect, because of its
emphasis upon dynamics, is the one of narrative equilibrium. This model was
suggested in 1960s France by philosopher Tzvetan Todorov, who also coined the
term “narratology”. Todorov considered narrative causality a dynamic process
tending towards equilibrium. For him, equilibrium seems to be a fundamental
structuring principle of narrative:
The minimal complete plot consists in the passage from one equilibrium to another. An
“ideal” narrative begins with a stable situation which is disturbed by some power or force.
There results a state of disequilibrium; by the action of a force directed in the opposite
direction, the equilibrium is re-established; the second equilibrium is similar to the ﬁrst, but
the two are never identical. (Todorov 1977, p. 111)
According to Todorov’s model, narrative is “a causal ‘transformation’ of a
situation through ﬁve stages” (Branigan 1992, p. 4), or ﬁve fundamental “actions”:
initial equilibrium, disruption of this equilibrium, recognition of disruption, repair of
disruption, reinstatement of the initial equilibrium.1 Todorov here on the one hand
follows a logic derived from Aristotelian poetics, and its division of drama in a
number of speciﬁc acts/stages. On the other hand, Todorov’s contribution focuses on
the structure of the form, thus it is more structuralist than Aristotle’s model in this
respect. I would add that, due to Todorov’s addition of an element of dynamics in the
study of narrative, his notion of narrative is systemic as well.
The complete ﬁve-stage equilibrium model is an ideal case, as Todorov himself
stresses, and he recognizes the existence of cases where the narrative does not do full
circle but describes “only the passage from an equilibrium to a disequilibrium, and
conversely” (Todorov 1977, p. 118). Although the ﬁrst two, or sometimes the last two
stages might be omitted, suspending a satisfactory resolution, all narratives can be
thought of as parts of the full ﬁve-stage circle (p. 39). In this respect, narrative
teleological causality can be imagined as a trajectory towards equilibrium, even in
cases when the latter is not ﬁnally achieved. The phase of equilibrium is considered
by Todorov as static (and corresponds, at the grammatical level of predicates, to the
role of adjectives), while disequilibrium is the dynamic phase, corresponding to verbs

fairy tale (also analyzed by Vladimir Propp) and Henry James’s In the Cage, see Todorov (1971).

(pp. 111, 120).2 However, if the above described “full circle” constitutes the basis of
the narrative model, then narrative dynamics is overarched by a symmetrical con-
struction—deﬁned by the initial and the concluding equilibrium. Indeed, as Branigan
notes, both Todorov’s as well as Vladimir Propp’s classical narrative analyses are
oriented towards the “large scale symmetries” of narratives (Branigan 1992, p. 9),
and, in this respect, deviate from the characterological focus of Aristotelian drama.
These large-scale symmetries are not causal in the strict sense of the word, which
implies a more or less direct relation between an effect and its cause (Branigan 1992,
p. 27). Moreover, their function is not to drive the action forward. They rather pertain
to what Todorov calls transformations, referring to larger patterns of change that do
not follow strict cause and effect sequences.
Todorov’s model has been tied to equilibrium, because of its emphasis upon
symmetry. However, I would argue that what makes his model distinctive is exactly
the opposite: its deﬁnition of narrative on the basis of change and disequilibrium.
The latter seems to be for Todorov the necessary (and perhaps sufﬁcient) condition
for narrative to exist. I quote a characteristic passage from his article in Diacritics,
where he analyzes Boccaccio’s Decameron III:
But what is it that makes this narrative? Let us return to the beginning of the story. Boccaccio
ﬁrst describes Naples, the setting of the action; then he presents the three protagonists; after
which he tells us about Ricciardo’s love for Catella. Is this a narrative? Once again I think we
can readily agree that it is not. The length of the text is not a deciding factor—only two
paragraphs in Boccaccio’s tale—but we sense that, even if it were ﬁve times this length,
things would not have changed. On the other hand, when Boccaccio says, “this was his state
of mind when . . .” (and at least in French there is a tense change here from the imperfect to
the aorist), the narrative is underway. The explanation seems simple: at the beginning we
witness the description of a state; yet this is not sufﬁcient for narrative, which requires the
development of an action, i.e., change, difference. (Todorov 1971, p. 38)
What is incompatible with narrative, according to Todorov’s description, is the
stasis of non-action. Change deﬁnes narrative, either at the micro-level of character-
ological action, or at the macro-level of “transformation”.
Narrative transformations might be “a-causal” but they still evoke causality,
although not in the sense of a cause and effect sequence. No matter where the
transformative agency lies, in anthropomorphic actors (with their desires, goals and
internal motives) or in actants (classes of actors), the overall patterns of change make
a narrative causal, as long as they reveal its status as an organization that develops
in time.
2With regard to the static and dynamic nature of motifs, Todorov draws on the Russian Formalist
Boris Tomashevsky.

Emergent Causality
The dynamics of causality in narrative do not manifest themselves only in transfor-
mation from state A to state B. They are also a matter, as already broached, of a
complex interplay of the different narrative levels, that of actors and actants and that
of overall formal structure. In order to explain my claim that causality in narratives
can be thought as emergent out of the complex interplay of these levels, it is necessary
to introduce in more detail the concept of emergence, as it has been developed ﬁrst in
philosophy in the beginning of the last century, and later in (complex) systems theory.
The philosophical sense of emergence dates back to 1875, when George Henry
Lewes used it in his work Problems of Life and Mind. In the late nineteenth and
early twentieth century, emergence was a central concern for the cycle of British
Emergentists, who participated in the debate between mechanists and vitalists about
the genealogy of sciences. Emergentists occupied a moderate position, resisting the
reduction of biology, and secondarily of chemistry, to physics. Life, according to
them, is not just an outcome of mechanical laws, neither is it a substance itself; some
of its qualities continue to be irreducible to mere mechanical processes. Among the
most important ﬁgures of British Emergentism have been John Stuart Mill and
Charlie Dunbar Broad. While Mill retained the attribute of causality in emergence,
Broad initiated (in The Mind and Its Place in Nature, 1925) a “synchronic, noncausal,
covariational account of the relationship of emergent features to the conditions that
gave rise to them” (O’Connor and Wong 2009); his account has certain afﬁnities with
the contemporary revived interest in emergence. The “noncausal” character that
British Emergentists ascribed to emergence is due to the fact that emergent laws are
“trans-ordinal”, as Broad called them, that is, they refer to the connection of one order
(or level) with another, and do not apply in the case of elements situated within the
same order. Trans-ordinal laws can only be found a posteriori and at the higher level,
and cannot be predicted by any existent law about the composition of lower-level
elements: “[. . .] we must wait till we meet with an actual instance of an object of the
higher order before we can discover such a law; and [. . .] we cannot possibly deduce it
beforehand from any combination of laws which we have discovered by observing
aggregates of a lower order” (Broad, The Mind and Its Place in Nature; cited by
O’Connor and Wong 2009). Trans-ordinal or emergent laws “describe a synchronic
noncausal covariation of an emergent property and its lower-level emergent base”
(O’Connor and Wong 2009). “Noncausal” here means that no single law of the lower
level can account for the property that emerges at the higher level, thus direct cause-
and-effect chains between different levels cannot be established. According to
Broad’s approach to emergence, “high-level causal patterns” are additional to those
at the lower level, and they can exert inﬂuence upon the lower levels, in a manner that
has more recently been characterized as “downward causation” (Campbell 1974).
Other British Emergentists, and especially Samuel Alexander, have been more
inﬂuential than Broad in contemporary science. Contradicting Mill and Broad,
Alexander dismissed autonomous higher-level causality. Even though he emphasized
the novelty of emergent qualities, he thought of emergence as an epistemological
16

217

rather than an ontological category. According to the criticism, however, the “weak”
emergence of Alexander cannot account for the causal properties of the whole
constituted by the parts (Clayton 2006, pp. 25–26); such properties are indispensible
in order for the whole to be considered as an autonomous entity.
Although the degree of connection between different orders was a point of dispute
for Emergentists, what is stressed in all emergentist accounts as a central property of
emergence is unpredictability: “Emergent properties are systemic features of com-
plex systems which could not be predicted [. . .] from the standpoint of a pre-emergent
stage, despite a thorough knowledge of the features of, and laws governing, their
parts” (O’Connor and Wong 2009). Preoccupied with wholes that are not reducible to
their parts, the concept of emergence found fertile ground in systems theory, which
revived the interest in emergence (O’Connor and Wong 2009). Since Ludwig von
Bertalanffy’s General Systems Theory (GST), systems theory “was put forward as a
counter to what was perceived as excessive reductionism dominating scientiﬁc
discourse during much of the twentieth century” (EMIL 2007).
Different degrees of emergence, from strong (absolute irreducibility and
completely “new” properties) to weak (practical but not analytical irreducibility),
have been identiﬁed in the philosophy of emergence, and causality plays a crucial role
in the difference between the two—strong and weak—versions.3 Contemporary
accounts of emergence in the context of complex systems study seem to favor a
“weaker”, or “intermediate”, version of it.4 The weak emergent approach is materi-
alistic, according to systems scholar Mark Bedau, as it steps on the existence of
microdynamics between material components of the microlevel that result in the
emergence of operationally autonomous macrophenomena (Bedau 1997, p. 395).
The recent complex systems theories favor these weaker versions of emergence, as
the material substrate of autonomous units and their interrelations are considered to be
involved in an active way in emergent self-organization.
3Strong emergence holds that the new properties of a system are not connected to the system’s
previous states but rather consist in ontologically novel properties. Thus, although it shares the
attributes of “supereminence” and “downward causation” with weak emergence, strong emergence
denies the existence of any kind of link between “the aggregation of the micro-level potentialities”
and “the supervenient downward causal powers” upon them (Bedau 1997, p. 377). However, as
Jaegwon Kim stresses (2006, pp. 200–201), talking about human consciousness as an emergent
property (based on the complex interactions of the brain’s neural network), this negative—because
of the absence of causal links—deﬁnition of irreducible, “strong” emergence tells nothing about
what emergence is, and about the relations that connect the different levels with each other. Thus he
poses the challenge for researchers of emergence “to show that emergent properties do not succumb
to the threat of epiphenomenalism, and that emergent phenomena can have causal powers vis-à-vis
physical phenomena.”
4Chalmers (2006) has suggested the term “intermediate emergence” to describe systems “in which
high-level facts and laws are not deducible from low-level laws (combined with initial conditions)”,
and, in this case, a change of level is necessary in order to understand the emergent procedure, a
level in which combinations not deducible from the basic laws but only effectuated with a change of
initial conditions occur.
218
M. Poulaki

Complex systems are nonlinear and irreducible, in the sense that “a single high
level property may be realized by more than one set of micro-states which have no
lawful relationship between them” (EMIL 2007). However, as a case of weak
emergence, the irreducibility of a complex system does not preclude (nonlinear)
deducibility from the initial conditions, although these conditions are impossible to
clearly deﬁne in open (and not isolated) systems. Therefore, the methods that are
usually employed in the study of emergence in complex systems are simulation or
statistical modelling (Byrne 1998, p. 62). Thus, the study of emergent causality
demands a synthetic rather than an analytical approach, because synthetic approaches
follow the bottom-up constitution of systems. According to Bedau, “the macrostate’s
behavior” could be derived “from the system’s microdynamic” only by means of
simulation (Bedau 1997, p. 378), or “modeling all the interactions of the realizing
microstates leading up to it from its initial conditions” (O’Connor and Wong 2009).
4
Nonlinear Causality and Emergence from Cybernetics
to Complex Systems Theory
Before returning to narrative and its emergent causality, I need to take another short
detour through a different thread of complex systems theory starting from cybernetics
(the study of regulatory systems), in order to add some further insights into the
causality of complex systems. In the cybernetic tradition, nonlinear causality has
been associated with the notion of feedback. Philosopher Manuel de Landa credits
Norman Wiener, the “father” of cybernetics, with a nonlinear idea of causality, which
broke with a tradition of “linear (nonreciprocal) causality” (De Landa 2009, p. 67).
Magoroh Maruyama’s study of positive and negative feedback, as well as Humberto
Maturana’s and Francisco Varela’s “autocatalytic loops”, further established a
nonlinear conception of causality. This conception countered the dominant concep-
tion of causality in Western thought, according to which “similar conditions produce
similar effects” (Maruyama 1963, p. 4).
The nonlinear approach to causality questions the value of negative feedback and
stability, and highlights the role of non-equilibrium in the organization of systems.
According to Bertuglia and Vaio, this shift to positive feedback and non-equilibrium
also marked the “overtaking” of cybernetics by complexity theory:
Cybernetics, in reality, can be considered a science that anticipated complexity in the
investigation of dynamical systems, precisely because it was the ﬁrst to make use of concepts
such as isolated or closed systems that regulate themselves by means of internal feedback
cycles. [. . .] complexity has overtaken cybernetics because it makes use of new concepts
such as, in particular, self-organization and emergence; in other words, because it considers
systems that evolve towards new states that do not have negative feedback cycles. (Bertuglia
and Vaio 2005, p. 264)
When causality is conceived in nonlinear systems, it becomes the emergent
product of the aggregation and “synergy” of a system’s elements. Causal synergy
16
Emergent Causality in Complex Films and Complex Systems
219

and emergence are what differentiate nonlinear from linear systems. As complexity
scientist Grégoire Nicolis explains,
In a linear system the ultimate effect of the combined action of two different causes is merely
the superposition of the effects of each cause taken individually. But in a nonlinear system
adding two elementary actions to one another can induce dramatic new effects reﬂecting the
onset of cooperativity between the constituent elements. (Nicolis 1995, p. 1)
The combination of different agents in a complex system has causal inﬂuence that
again exceeds that of the sum of the combined causes taken individually. Nonlinearity
in the mathematical sense of the word refers exactly to this disproportionality between
starting conditions and results. To link this back to the previous discussion of the
concept of emergence and its philosophical genealogy, “weaker” versions of emer-
gence suggest that there is a connection between properties at the micro-level and
those at the macro-level, but this connection is nonlinear. This, however, does not
preclude some kind of causality to exist between the different levels.
In complex systems accounts, emergence is not acausal. It rather pertains to a
different, “pattern-based” as it has been called, form of causality. Jeffrey Goldstein
(Goldstein 1996, p. 178), following Ben Goertzel’s mathematical model of “pattern
dynamics”,5 rejects the view according to which complex chaotic processes are
acausal—he refers speciﬁcally to the philosopher of science Stephen Kellert who
expresses such a view in his book In the Wake of Chaos. Suggesting “a revision of
causal explanation in the light of emergence” (Goldstein 1996, p. 163), instead of an
abolishment of causality altogether, Goldstein distinguishes pattern-based causality
(revolving around questions such as “how do the new patterns shown in emergent
phenomena relate to previous patterns in the system?”) from the traditional,
“substantialist” causality (implied by questions such as “what is it made of?” and
“how much of it is there”) (p. 165). Emergence is caused when already existing
systemic patterns become more complex, creating “a plurality of folds” (p. 169).
Thus, either through “Boolean networks” (as Stuart Kauffman claims) or the “Baker
transformation” (as does Ilya Prigogine), “emergent phenomena have [within the
system] complex precursors” (Goldstein 1996, p. 170), and they do not just “pop up”
out of the initial simplicity of a system. By characterizing a property as emergent, one
does not imply that there is no way to explain or understand its occurrence. Causation
is still an issue in emergence, but it does not happen horizontally, following the model
of bowling balls hitting each other, as a classical mechanical approach to causality
would imply, but vertically, between different scales and levels. Emergent events are
“wholes”, the causal effects of which “cannot be correctly represented in terms of the
separate causal effects of [the] constituents” (O’Connor and Wong 2009).
It is complexity itself that demands some notion of causality to be preserved for
emergent phenomena. There is a causal link, Goldstein argues, between increased
complexity and emergence (Goldstein 1996, p. 174). The insistence upon the
coupling of emergence with causality is a stance that rejects both “hard” scientiﬁc
reductionism and the absolute detachment of the emergent phenomenon from its

functional substrates (as a “strong emergence” thesis would have it). Rather, it is
compatible with the combination of the “local” with the “global” level (p. 175). As
Prigogine and philosopher Isabelle Stengers mention in their book The End of
Certainty, there is “a narrow path between two conceptions that both lead to
alienation: a world ruled by deterministic laws, which leaves no place for novelty,
and a world ruled by a dice-playing God, where everything is absurd, acausal, and
incomprehensible” (Prigogine and Stengers 1997, p. 188; my emphasis).
Emergence seems to require a bridge between the microlevel and the macrolevel,
which allows a view over the patterns developed by aggregates of separate micro-
elements. As O’Connor and Wong note: “Of central importance is to recognize that
the relationship of micro-level structures and macro-level emergent properties is
dynamic and causal, not static and formal (in a quasi-logical sense)” (O’Connor and
Wong 2005). Especially the weak and synergetic conceptions of causality derived
from emergentist approaches and second wave cybernetics can be very useful for the
development of new models to approach the causality that operates between the
different diegetic and narrational levels.
5
Emergent Causality and Narrative
The reader might at this point rightly wonder how this discussion of causality and
emergence, coming mainly from physics, as well as philosophy, can be relevant to the
study of narrative and narrative agents, who are not particles but ﬁctive characters and
situations. Narrative causality is not the mechanical and “linear” (in the strict sense)
causality of Newtonian laws. It is not physical or mathematical but anthropomorphic,
less precise and less tight than causality at the level of natural elements, to which
complexity in sciences refers. In one sense, causality in most narratives and narrative
ﬁlms is a priori “loose”. According to organizational theorists Haridimos Tsoukas and
Mary Jo Hatch, narrative can be a model for all modes of thinking in which causality
does not operate through strict and reductive logical sequences, but “through associ-
ations that are not causal in the logico-scientiﬁc sense” (Tsoukas and Hatch 2001,
p. 1006). As they point out, narrative causality operates through patterns of “co-
occurrence, spatial proximity, formal similarity or metaphor” (p. 1006), features that
“may help us to understand [. . .] the non-linearity, indeterminacy, unpredictability,
and emergence of complex systems” (p. 1007). However, this conception of narrative
is already made from a meta-narrative perspective, and particularly from one of
complex systems theory that re-interprets narrative as a complex system, and has not
always been self-evident in narrative studies, nor is it still.
In ﬁlm studies in particular, narrative has been clearly differentiated from other
non-narrative formal systems that are possible in ﬁlm, such as the rhetorical,
categorical, associational and abstract forms distinguished by ﬁlm scholars David
Bordwell and Kristin Thompson (2008). Certain among these non-narrative forms,
and especially the associational one, which creates patterns of images related
according to motifs, have similar characteristics with those that Tsoukas and Hatch
16

221

mention. But this form, prominent in “experimental” ﬁlms, according to Bordwell
and Thompson (2008, p. 356), is downplayed in narrative ﬁlms. The deﬁnition of
narrative in ﬁlm theory but also in narratology, sticks to the notion of causality as an
organizing principle that arranges events in causal-logical sequences.
Narrative can perhaps more easily be thought of as in afﬁnity with complex
systems when conceived as a cognitive system of interpretation that retrospectively
determines the sequence of events so that they can be placed in a causal-logical
chain. But a complex systemic approach requires a careful examination of how any
form of cognitive organization emerges from the level of the syuzhet (plot), and how
the text and its construction complicate and even withhold the top-down establish-
ment of causality towards which narrative tends.
To the extent that complex narratives can be conceived as complex systems
(Poulaki 2011), they may still form organizations, communicate and produce mean-
ing without putting their elements into a steady linear arrangement. As long as
meaning making processes in complex ﬁlms are concerned, and provided that these
are emergent processes, both textually and cognitively in the different systems of the
ﬁlm’s text and the viewer’s cognitive system, a weak rather than a strong conception
of their emergence can prove useful. This implies that the textual form of the syuzhet
matters in the emergence of meaning. Adopting a weak emergent approach to the
causality involved in narratives would mean to direct our attention to the actual causal
role that the multiple constitution and the non-linear ordering of the syuzhet and the
relations between its elements have in the emergence of a whole. In the opposite case,
a strong emergent approach that would consider this whole to be completely inde-
pendent of its units, an “order” or schema that emerges in all cases of reading and
viewing being independent of the speciﬁc characteristics of each text, would tell us
nothing, to paraphrase Jaegwon Kim (2006, p. 200), about the processes through
which the cognitive and ﬁlmic organization is constituted in complex ﬁlms.
Like physicists and organizational scientists, narrative scholars also increasingly
recognize “that the presence of multilayered and changing contexts, multidirectional
causalities, and feedback loops often disturb steady progression toward “equilib-
rium” (Langley 1999, p. 692; cited in Boje 2001), and the study of narrative
organization focuses more and more on these complex processes that make narrative
emerge.

Structure and Emergence in Networks, from Social
Theory to Narrative
Let us take as an example a particular case of narrative complexity, that of the
so-called “network narratives” in cinema, which are particularly interesting in terms
of causality. Prominent ﬁlm scholar David Bordwell in his 2006 book The Way
Hollywood Tells It identiﬁed network narratives as an important category within the
222

recent wave of complex narratives in popular cinema.6 Network narratives are
multiple protagonist ﬁlms with parallel and interconnected stories, involving, as
Bordwell further explored in Poetics of Cinema (2007), loose causality, connections
by chance or coincidence, and repetitions of the same events from the perspective of
different characters. Some of the oft-cited complex narratives in this respect are
Code Inconnu (Michael Haneke 2000), Crash (Paul Haggis 2005), Alejandro
González Iñárritu’s 21 Grams (2003), and Babel (2006). If we think of such network
narratives as complex systems, then their narrative organization can be conceived as
emerging from the relations between their multiple elements (narrative agents and
threads) and their complex causal interactions. Adopting a complex systems frame-
work, the number of characters in narratives, and mostly the number and entangle-
ment of their interactions, can be seen as disrupting the classical schemata of
causality in narrative.
From a complex systems perspective, the number of components of a system and
their relations plays a fundamental role in the system’s complexity. Complex
systems scientist Stuart Kauffman has shown that complexity builds up in multi-
agent and densely interconnected systems (Kauffman 1993, p. 243). These two
factors, the number of agents and the density of connections, are interdependent,
as the big number of individual units increases the possible interactions and therefore
the complexity of the resulting system. As the anthropologist and neuroscientist
Terrence Deacon notes,
With every iterated interaction, relational properties are multiplied with respect to each
other, so an increase in numbers of elements and chances for interactions increases the
relative importance of interaction parameters and related contextual variables. (Deacon
2006, pp. 121–122)
By increasing the number of agents, narratives also increase the relational range
and the complexity of the network that these relations form.
Complexity theory, as Russ Marion points out, “envisions adaptive systems (spe-
cies, animals, plants, viruses, etc.) as neural-like interactive networks of agents and
seeks to understand the dynamics of network behaviors” (2006, p. 274). Emergence
happens only through such dynamic interrelations. As Marion notes, “events emerge
from complex interactive dynamics involving neural-like networks of adaptive agents.
That is, emergent events are products of unpredictable combinations and recombina-
tions among interdependent agents” (p. 259). The “networked, interdependent inter-
actions” are characteristic of every complex system. Interactions between a large
number of agents/elements create increasing complexity, but these interactions
between the nodes need to be dynamical and reciprocal, in order for them to transform
6This wave has attracted both popular and theoretical attention (by scholars like Thomas Elsaesser
(2009), Warren Buckland (2009), Allan Cameron (2008) and others). Films like Pulp Fiction
(Quentin Tarrantino 1994), Run Lola Run (Tom Tykwer 1998), The Matrix (Andy and Lana
Wachowski 1999), The Sixth Sense (M. Night Shyamalan 1999), Memento (Christopher Nolan
2000), and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (Michel Gondry 2004) are among the most
oft-cited examples.

into an emergent organization. A complex approach to network narratives would also
be differentiated from structuralist approaches—instead of emphasizing the larger
structural forms and transformations, it would place more emphasis on the emergent
dynamics at the “meso-level” of unit/agent interactions, and the particular ways they
give rise to “macro”-transformations.
Network theory has not always been (and still is not exactly) synonymous with
systems theory. Network theory has historically been a structure-oriented approach,
but complex network theory as a strand of systems theory moves beyond structures,
focusing on the emergent dynamics that the interrelations between units release
(Barrat et al. 2008). It is interesting how a similar polarity is found in the history of
network theory in sociology to that between the two narrative causality models
mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the Aristotelian and the Structuralist one.
Emirbayer and Goodwin distinguish between different versions of “structuralism” in
network theory: the “structuralist deterministic” model prioritizes the potency of
structures over that of the individual actors, while that of “structuralist instrumen-
talism” prioritizes actors. The former tends to work with “static ‘map conﬁgurations’
or relational ‘snapshots’ of network patterns” (Emirbayer and Goodwin 1994,
p. 1426), ending up in reifying relations and considering them overarching structures
that determine the units; the latter takes the theory of “homo economicus” as its
starting point, attributing to individual nodes a rationalistic and utility-maximizing
logic, which, even in a bottom-up direction, still pre-determines the conduct of the
network’s actors/nodes. Such a double “structuration” became apparent through
the reference earlier in this chapter to different models of causality in narrative; on
the one hand, the “characterological” (Aristotelian) construction of causality is based
on anthropomorphic motives, while on the other hand the structuralist—in the
narratological sense—analysis of causality succumbs the dynamics of the plot’s
form to overarching symmetries that preexist them. A change of theoretical context
though would allow, as it did in sociology, for different properties of networks to
come to the fore. Complex systems theory in sociology aims at revealing the
dynamical nature of social networks and highlighting the complex links and inter-
relationships between the micro-level of individuals and the network macro-level.
Between these two levels, a multiplicity of nested systems with their own interrela-
tionships weaves the patterns of social complexity (Byrne 1998, p. 10).
In sociology too, as in cybernetics, systems theory initially adopted a very
different approach from the one that the “new”, complex systems theory takes.
Even today, systems theory in sociology often refers back to the work of Talcott
Parsons, who, inﬂuenced by cybernetics, developed a model of society—known as
“functionalism”—as a hierarchy of nested systems always beginning from—and
tending towards—equilibrium. This model can be seen as analogous to the equilib-
rium model of narrative in Tzvetan Todorov’s narratology, since Todorov deﬁned
equilibrium in a similar way, as “the existence of a stable but not static relation
224
M. Poulaki

between the members of a society” (Kafalenos 2006, p. 4);7 and this conception of
equilibrium, similar to that of Parsons, inﬂuenced his adaptation of structural equi-
librium into his narrative theory. However, as Kenneth Bailey argues, the emphasis
that functionalism placed on equilibrium gradually became incompatible with the
development of the (new) systems theory in sociology. The latter saw entropy (the
amount of “redundant” energy that increases during a thermodynamic process) as
well as nonequilibrium as the bases for both biological and social organization. Along
with the development of complex systems theory, social systems theory differentiated
from functionalism, departing from the “age of equilibrium” to enter the “age of
entropy” (Bailey 1994, p. 5).8 A combination of autopoietic self-organization with
complexity emphasizes evolutionary dynamics that can be observed from the
macrolevel: “macro-level social order is a complex product of micro-level intention-
ality and the wider non-linear operation of the system” (p. 5). The nonlinear process
of self-organization is described by Peter Coveney as “the spontaneous emergence of
non-equilibrium structural reorganizations on a macroscopic level, due to the collec-
tive interactions between a large number of (usually simple) microscopic objects”
(Coveney 2003, p. 1058). The recent rise of complex and emergent approaches to the
study of social and other kinds of networks as complex systems provides new
methods to bridge the micro-macro divide.
Narrative has been used as a counter-example of emergent organization in this
respect. Patrick Doreian comments on how sociologists have tried to describe the
formation of networks using narrative. However, the limitations of this approach,
which emphasizes causality, soon became manifest, since networks cannot be
represented in causal-temporal chains of events.
A narrative as a straightforward description of a sequence of events has considerable appeal.
Most network analysts who study empirical phenomena use narrative. In part, it is window
dressing, but it has more than surface interest. The risk is that the narrative becomes yet another
just-so story with events following each other in time under convenient stage management.
Once it is recognized that the only real connection between the described events is merely
temporal, the causal enterprise is shaken. If a different event could follow a given event—which
happens—the coupling of the events in a narrative is loosened. And, if there could be other
outcomes between two hitherto sequential events that appear in a set of narratives, the tight
coupling between events is lost again. [. . .] The most hard-nosed assessment is that truly
establishing causality in network analysis is impossible—just as it is in the realm of statistical
causality. [. . .] There needs to be a very tight coupling of theory, mechanisms, and credible
empirical information before we can delineate the actual operation of causes in the empirical
world before we can tell causal stories. (Doreian 2001, pp. 110–111)
7Todorov formulated this model through his analysis of Boccacio’s Decameron in the 1960s, a
period when the popularity of functionalism in sociology had started fading, but not the interest in
equilibrium.
8Research in the ﬁeld of nonequilibrium thermodynamics contributed to a paradigm shift with
regard to entropy, which was initially considered to indicate the gradual disorganization and “death”
of a system. Out-of-equilibrium processes maximize entropy but also create—in open systems—an
order that is different from the one of systems in equilibrium. This order is produced by the self-
organization of a system in a “state of increased complexity” (Prigogine and Stengers 1997, p. 64).
Thus nonequilibrium and entropy can be considered forms of organization.

Here the term narrative refers to the particular type of presentation of research
ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of social networks, a description that the writer objects. Even
though in a very different context from that of ﬁlm and literary theory, the function of
narrative here is reminiscent of the way narrative as a cognitive process is conceived
by narrative theorists, namely as a mode of data organization that constructs a causal
story—and “meaning”—even from the most bafﬂed and “anti-narrative” texts, in
which causality is loosened or even broken. Our ability to construct causal stories, in
the sense of tight coupling of events, is challenged by complex narratives, and at the
same time a need is created to account for the organizing potential lying in a different,
pattern-based causality. The multiplicity of agents that the example of “network
ﬁlms” involves is one of the available means through which linear causality is
undermined and other types of organization become prominent. Thus, complex
narratives in cinema seem to call for a development in ﬁlm and narrative theory
analogous to that in sociology or organizational theory. Emergent and bottom-up
approaches to textual organization become pertinent when the lines of causality as
traditionally conceived in narrative theory are broken, and when structuralist models
of symmetry do not prove helpful. These approaches help us see how diegetic wholes
emerge when narrative, along with both Aristotelian and structuralist conceptions of
causality, is conceived as an emergent and not an a priori organization.
As organizational theorist David Boje suggests, “linear causality is a convenient
ﬁction, an over-simpliﬁed narrative of complex antenarrative dynamics in which
non-linearity (and that too is a ﬁction) reigns” (Boje 2001, pp. 93–94). The “chance
encounters” and the “intersections of strangers” proliferating in network narratives
highlight even in a way much simpler than in natural complex systems the
antenarrative (from the Latin ante meaning “before”) dynamics inherent in narratives
that make their causality not just loose but nonlinear, organizing them in an emergent
way. Nonlinearity characterizes the interactions of characters/actors at the represen-
tational level and also the “causal logic” of the narration itself, involved in the
cognitive construction of the diegesis by the viewer.

Dynamics of Transformation and Narrative
As already broached, an important aspect that differentiates the complex systemic
approach from older cybernetic approaches to systems has to do with a passage from
the “age of equilibrium” to that of entropy, according to Bailey’s expression. This
passage also has to do with a shift to an “ensemble” perspective. Moreover, it is a
factor that differentiates complex systemic approaches to causality from traditional
narrative approaches.
Nonequilibrium and change are the basic features of self-organizing systems,
according to Prigogine, the founder of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which is
226
M. Poulaki

considered one of the strands of complex systems theory (Bailey 1994, p. 121).9
Unlike Newtonian dynamics, nonequilibrium thermodynamics prioritizes evolution
and entropy instead of time-reversibility or equilibrium. The behaviour of systems
cannot be described in terms of trajectories of individuals (in the case of thermody-
namics, these “individuals” are molecules) but in terms of populations or “ensem-
bles”,10 whose movement in time (or succession of states they are found in) is
probabilistic and irreversible, leading to new, emerging properties.
In stable systems, there is no difference between the level of the individual
trajectories and the one of ensembles; the ensemble can be easily understood as an
additive collection of the individual trajectories. However, in unstable dynamical
systems, as Prigogine and Stengers mention, “the equivalence between the individual
point of view and the statistical point of view [. . .] is broken” (Prigogine and Stengers
1997, p. 83), and asymmetry is established between individuals and aggregates. What
according to a Newtonian—and linear—trajectory description would appear as
divergence, according to a statistical—“ensemble” and complex—description can
appear as “resonance”, “a coupling of events loosely analogous to the coupling of
sounds by resonance” (p. 42).
It is of course not easy to draw an analogy between the behaviour of particles in
physics and that of agents in narratives. However, based on the principle of isomor-
phism that characterizes complex systems theory as a transdisciplinary ﬁeld, we could
argue for a similar “ensemble approach” in complex narrative analysis. If agents/
actors in a narrative are conceived as individuals in single trajectories from one event
to the next, then an ensemble approach introduces an asymmetry that changes this
picture. The single trajectory perspective makes events appear as the causes and
effects of other events, triggered most of the time by human (or anthropomorphic)
action. Complex/network narratives, as already mentioned, are structured around
events that are disconnected from their causes, contingent on and divergent from the
causal-logical sequence. Thus, the single trajectory perspective, or that of “lines of
causality” is not particularly helpful, as it tends to reduce the causality of complex
narratives to a classical Newtonian model. The ensemble perspective, however,
makes events appear as emergent products of resonance between multiple threads
of action, initiated by initial conditions that are different each time. Single trajectories
of actions and events can only make sense as long as they are placed in an ensemble,
resonating with other parallel trajectories. Complex narratives can organize them-
selves by means of resonance, producing complex textual organizations, and the
recipient may follow them by similar cognitive resonances. Because of the multiplic-
ity reﬂected in their plots, these narratives favour non-anthropomorphic—
9According to Bailey, there are four main currents in systems theory: nonequilibrium thermody-
namics (established through the work of Prigogine on entropy), cybernetics, information theory and
general systems theory (GST). These currents with their combined principles generate the trans-
disciplinary ﬁeld of “new”, as Bailey calls it, complex systems theory (Bailey 1994, p. 121).
10Albert Einstein and Josiah Willard Gibbs used the word “ensemble”, although they ended up with
a model of “superimposition of trajectories”, as Prigogine and Stengers note (1997, p. 34).

“ensemble” in the statistical sense—descriptions, that highlight the patterns of agency
emerging from the micro-level of unit interactions.
Are these statistical ensemble descriptions narrative? One of the basic problems
with narrative is that it holds onto the notion of the observer. This anthropomorphic
observer always judges events as probable or improbable and establishes causality
between them. From the perspective of complex systems, causality can be conceived
as “the outcome of a stochastic, probabilistic process” (Prigogine and Stengers
1997, p. 37; my emphasis), the same process that drives self-organization. However,
this statistical sense of probability is different from the one based on a human
observer. Prigogine and Stengers explain how probabilities are now built into the
fundamental laws of the universe, which behaves probabilistically independent of an
observer (pp. 5, 54 and 131). The complex interactions that take place before even
narrative becomes possible, require, in the context of complex narratives, syuzhet-
focused approaches that do not take narrative as their starting or ending point,
approaches that would thus focus before or beyond narrative. Diegetic agent-based
models may be one of the ways to take into account interacting agents that produce
the diegetic world by means of ensemble (here not only in the statistical sense but
also according to the use of the word in ﬁlm/narrative theory, as in “ensemble ﬁlms”
that contain aggregation of agents) rather than individual trajectories.
An “agent-based” approach to ﬁlm narrative analysis, following the logic of agent-
based methodologies used in simulations of complex systems, would allow for a
multi-directional feedback circuit to be established between the different narrational
levels. “Agent-based” simulations of complex systems, also referred to as “multi-agent
approaches”, are used in the study of natural, economic and social systems. Referring
to such simulations, computer scientist Pierre Marcenac distinguishes between “micro-
agents” who lack knowledge of global constraints, “medium-agents” who model the
interactions of micro-agents and who feed back (through a process called “back-
propagation”) upon the micro-agents’ behaviour, introducing constraints to it, and
lastly, “macro-agents”, who observe self-organization and ‘generate’ the medium-
agents who model it (Marcenac 1998). Applying this approach to complex narratives,
the micro-diegetic level of characters and actions gives way, through complication of
relations and nonlinear causality, to aggregates of agency at the meso-level. Mutual
causal processes take place across levels. Higher-level “medium-agents”, who are the
result of (or, in simulations, who are introduced as models of) the aggregates of
individual units/micro-agents, feed back into the micro-agents, who are in turn
affected by the connections created between them—in complex network narratives,
the characters’ single trajectories are inﬂuenced by the links created between them,
which also affect the overall plot’s structure. The meso-level of interconnections
introduces constraints to the micro-level, but at the same time contributes to the overall
transformation, taking place at the extra-diegetic macro-level, of the text into an
organization that acquires a causality—or agency—of its own. Causality in complex
network narratives takes place across all three levels and is differentiated, by means of
its emergent properties, both from the character-based causality and from a determin-
istic conception of narrative causal structure.

Irreversible processes create an order that is different from the one of systems in
equilibrium. This ordering through nonequilibrium is produced by the self-organization
of a system in a “state of increased complexity” (Prigogine and Stengers 1997, p. 64;
emphasis in the original). Here what Todorov called narrative transformation becomes
again relevant. It is not causality in the traditional sense of the word, but transformation,
happening not only horizontally, as a progression from State A to State B, but also
vertically across the embedded intra-diegetic and extra-diegetic narrative levels, that
generates the causality of a narrative system. Transformation may be observed when
the state of a system is compared at two different points in time, but the dynamics of
transformation cannot be captured in such an observation of a horizontal progression.
Narrative as a form of retrospective representation cannot address the process of
transformation itself. It is the gradual development of the syuzhet that reveals the
dynamics resulting in transformation. Transformation is an emergent process deter-
mined by contingency and impossible to attribute to a single cause or causal line.
In his article “Narrative and Emergent Behavior”, literary theorist Porter Abbott
argues that emergent action does not follow anthropomorphic laws of causal conti-
nuity and direct consequences of actions, laws that are indispensible in narrative
(Abbott 2008, p. 237). Emergence happens in-between the micro and the macro
level, and narrative according to the same writer cannot approach this area (p. 234).
Thus, Abbott concludes that emergent behaviour, with its nonlinear causality, is “by
deﬁnition unnarratable” (p. 233). The multiplicity of agents is for him one of the
most characteristic obstacles that narrative faces when it comes to complex
behaviour:
[. . .] the principal reason for the incompatibility of emergent behavior with narrative
understanding is its massive distribution of causal agents—a complexity of causation so
acute that it disallows any perceptible chain of causation that could serve as a narrative
thread. Narrative can and does play a limited role in our understanding of emergent behavior
but does so only at the micro level of individual agents [. . .] and the macro level of the whole
[. . .]. (Abbott 2008, p. 227)
Even though the distribution of agents in complex narratives is far from massive,
as it is, for example, at the level of particles in physics, or of biological organisms
such as ants, it still confronts the narrative understanding with an alternative and less
anthropomorphic way of understanding. As researchers or just readers and viewers
of narratives we can see emergent processes retrospectively, and then narrate them,
from a macro viewpoint. However, while these processes take place they are
unnarratable, and the only way to follow them is to participate in the textual and
cognitive resonances that transgress what has traditionally been conceived as nar-
rative reasoning.

Narrative and Cognitive Modelling: Insights
from Beckett Exploring Mind’s Complexity
Marco Bernini
Abstract Complex systems exacerbate a common problem for scientiﬁc enquiry:
the difﬁculty of creating models able to discriminate fundamental elements or
patterns from random behaviours or corollary components in the event or process
at issue. This chapter argues that a similar tension between order and randomness has
been a chief modelling problem of Samuel Beckett’s narratives, tied to his interest in a
speciﬁc kind of complex system (the mind) and its emergent properties (conscious-
ness and the narrative sense of self). Bulding on narratology, complex system
frameworks, cognitive theories of emergence and of scientiﬁc modelling, this chapter
introduces the idea of “ﬁctional cognitive modelling”. Through this concept, the
chapter analyses Beckett’s treatment of narrative devices as formal tools for the
creation of “exploratory models” able to atomise the emerging unity of conscious
experience and of a narrative sense of self into its core components (deﬁned as the
“narrative dynamic core”). It concludes by suggesting that Beckett’s narrative
method shows how literature can occupy a proper position in the investigation and
exploration of complex systems.

Modelling the Mind as a Complex System
Complex systems, despite their exceptionality, reiterate and exacerbate what is a
common problem for scientiﬁc enquiry: the difﬁculty of creating models able to
discriminate fundamental elements or patterns from random behaviours or corollary
components in the event or process at issue. As James Crutchﬁeld notes, “a key
modelling dichotomy that runs throughout all of science is that between order and
randomness” (2008, p. 273). In complex systems, this dichotomy is brought to the
utmost limit given that randomness dominates and patterns often eschew the sim-
plifying nature of modelling. In this respect, the resistance that complex systems
pose to narrative can be regarded as one speciﬁc subset of a more general difﬁculty:

to capture complexity with formal devices. Insofar as the stake is epistemic, it is hard
to gauge how much we lose of the actual dynamics of complex systems when trying
to make them ﬁt formal models—narrative structures included. As Richard Walsh
neatly states in this volume (Chap. 5), “there is an important gap between our
narrative talk of what a system does and how system actually does it”. The same
holds true, with some provisos, for the gap between scientiﬁc modelling and the
modelled systems. Despite the signiﬁcant divide between scientiﬁc and narrative
approaches to complexity that is the very object of this volume, a shared common
ground can therefore be found in the question of how we can model a (narrative)
form to accommodate the chaotic behaviour of complex system and their emergent
properties.
A similar question was the chief formal concern of Samuel Beckett’s work
throughout his career. As is famously reported, he explained in an interview with
Tom Driver in 1961 that he felt that the only viable task for art was “to ﬁnd a form to
accommodate the mess” (Driver 1979, p. 219). This chapter argues that for Beckett
this was a proper problem of modelling dichotomy tied to his interest in a speciﬁc
kind of complex system (the mind) and its emergent properties (consciousness and
the narrative sense of self). Within contemporary cognitive science and philosophy of
mind, it is increasingly suggested that the brain should be regarded as a complex
system (Gazzaniga 2012). Whether the mind and its mental properties, including
consciousness and a sense of selfhood, can be interpreted through the conceptual lens
of complex system theory is still a matter of debate (Vision 2011; Bedau and
Humphreys 2008; Macdonald and Macdonald 2010). As it is beyond the scope of
this essay to enter the controversy, I build exclusively on cognitive strands of research
taking consciousness and the sense of selfhood as emergent patterns of the mind
viewed as a complex system. An implicit ground of my argument, though, is that if
what are called “neural correlates” of mental states exist at the brain level, human
beings cannot access (narratively or not) their complex interaction. Conversely, a
sustained training in introspective techniques (Hurlburt and Heavey 2001) can let us
glimpse the complexity of the mental counterpart of the neural activity—the distinct
and chaotically interacting components (e.g., language, time-consciousness, mem-
ory, agency, imagination), working at the edge of their emergent global coordination
that gives rise to our uniﬁed feeling of being conscious and being ourselves. Mod-
ernist writers such as Beckett, as Dorrit Cohn pointed out, were arguably great
introspectors (Cohn 1978, p. 89), and the phenomenal data they gathered can
therefore have provided insights for deriving narrative modes (and models) of
exploration into what underlies or lies beyond our (to an important extent narratively)
uniﬁed feeling of subjective experience.
This uniﬁed feeling, either scientiﬁcally or introspectively, is hard to unpack into
its components, and this is taken as a positive sign of its emergent nature. As Basset
and Gazzaniga note, “although the material components of the physical brain might
be highly decomposable, mental properties seem to be fundamentally indivisible”
(2011, p. 5). Here, I suggest that Beckett was able to atomise the constantly emerging
unity of conscious experience into its core components, interacting and integrating at
the level of mind’s complexity. He reached this difﬁcult goal, I argue, by treating
234
M. Bernini

narrative elements, devices and structures as formal tools for his modelling strategy
that I call ﬁctional cognitive modelling. Importantly, to the extent that the uniﬁed
experience of selfhood is partly the result of a narrative dynamic, Beckett’s model-
ling of the mind as a complex system leads to and calls for a new deﬁnition of
narrative (which I attempt in Sect. 4) as an emergent property resulting from the
complex interaction of many levels and elements, such as those Beckett incorporates
in his models.
In Sect. 2, I start by elaborating further on the problematic modelling dichotomy
between order and chaos in Beckett’s work. In Sect. 3, I present some preliminary
arguments for why Beckett’s prose overcomes the limitation usually linked to a
narrative understanding of complexity. In Sect. 4, I introduce contemporary deﬁni-
tions of the mind as a complex system and of consciousness and the self as its
emergent properties. I also elaborate on the idea that our narrative sense of self is the
emergent outcome of key different components (which I call the narrative dynamic
core) within the mind’s complexity. In Sect. 5, I expand on the idea of the narrative
dynamic core, by ﬁnally showing how it has been either locally or globally modelled
in speciﬁc texts. In the conclusion, I argue that looking at Beckett’s use of narrative
as a modelling strategy can help reposition the literature as a ﬁeld of exploration into
mind’s complexity.
2
Narrative Chaotics and the Aboutness of Complexity
In the transcript of the already mentioned interview in 1961, Tom Driver, Professor
of Literature and Theology, reports how Beckett “began to speak about the tension in
art between the mess and form. Until recently, art has withstood the pressure of
chaotic things” (Driver 1979, p. 219). Driver then poses a question that is highly
relevant to the modelling dichotomy between complexity and its formal accommo-
dation: “How could the mess be admitted”, Driver inquires, “because it appears to be
the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds
itself to be” (p. 219). Translating the question into the complex system terminology,
the problem becomes how can narrative form approximate complexity given the
(temporal, linguistic, sequential, linear) structuring nature of the former that seems
refractory to chaotic behaviours? Beckett’s answer is that artistic form should not
“exist as a problem separate from the material it accommodates” (p. 219). More than
thirty years earlier, Beckett had already formulated his stance about the necessary
conﬂation of content and form, identifying in the writing of James Joyce the
landmark example of a literary narrative where “form is content, content is
form”—notoriously claiming that “his writing is not about something; it is that
something itself” (Beckett 1984, p. 27). In Beckett’s terms, the modelling dichotomy
occurring when (narratively) tackling complexity can be redeﬁned as how to go
beyond the aboutness of complex systems.
In her study on what she labels “narrative chaotics”, Jo Alyson Parker (2007)
addresses a similar issue. She takes the lead from a 1996 article by Steven Johnson in
17
Narrative and Cognitive Modelling: Insights from Beckett Exploring. . .
235

which he restricts the possibility of literary narrative to the aboutness of complex
systems. In this article, Johnson explains how, in his opinion, novels “may be about
complex systems (cities, economies, ecosystems, and so on) and they are certainly
the products of complex systems (the neural nets of the human mind), but they
themselves are language-based, static, dictated from the outside. . .” (Johnson 1996,
p. 47). Parker’s objection is that the narrative works of Proust, Sterne, Woolf and
Faulkner have “certain narrative structures [which] resemble chaotic nonlinear
dynamical systems” and therefore can be classed as examples of “narrative chaotics”
(Parker 2007, p. 21). I am very sympathetic with Parker’s perceptive use of the
complex system’s toolbox for literary analysis. My concern here, however, is not to
analyse Beckett’s narrative works as complex systems themselves, but as models of
the mind as a complex system. This said, the problem of the aboutness remains, and
it is even more crucial. How can narratives targeting complexity do so without either
merely representing complex systems (the aboutness) or becoming themselves
complex systems (narrative chaotics)? Once again, this is a modelling dilemma
and, as happens with scientiﬁc modelling, either by becoming as complex as the
actual process or by distancing themselves too much towards an oversimpliﬁcation
of the process, narrative models can become useless.
Models of a process, in fact, never equal the process itself, but are formal
simpliﬁcations enabling different kinds of analysis. As Lewandosky and Farrell
synthesize in their comprehensive book on cognitive models, at its most basic “a
model is an abstract structure that captures structure in the data” (2011, p. 10). This
structural relation between models and processes can be directed at different
scopes—descriptive, predictive, explanatory or exploratory. I return to this in the
conclusion to consider how Beckett’s work can be understood in relation to this
variety of models. For now, it is enough to say that a model’s structural relation with
a process is more than mere aboutness and less than full identity. Thanks to the
model, structures can be perceived (or hypothesized), patterns explored, processes
characterized in terms of key components. It is worth repeating, though, that, as
Lewandosky and Farrell constantly stress, “models are intended to be simpler and
more abstract versions of the system—in our case human cognition—they are trying
to explain . . . Models seek to retain the essential features of the system while
discarding uneccessary details. By deﬁnition, the complexity of models will thus
never match the complexity of human cognition—nor should it, because there is no
point in replacing one thing we do not understand with another” (2011, p. 11;
italics mine).
With Beckett, however, it would be hard to maintain that his narrative modelling
of mind’s complexity has been driven by a belief in the possibility of better
understanding its cognitive underpinnings. Quite on the contrary, he repeatedly
insisted on the importance of accepting our ignorance about the complex chaotic
behaviour of the inside and outside worlds. Given that our mind is a complex system
itself, how can we aspire to reach an understanding of its functioning from within?
As Beckett makes clear in a letter to George Duthuit in 1949, since we are enmeshed
in complexity, “being in it discourages you from knowing it” (Beckett 2011, p. 131).
In a similar vein, in another letter to Duthuit one year before, Beckett harshly
236
M. Bernini

comments on the geometrical painting technique of Antonello da Messina’s St
Sebastian—“pure space by dint of mathematics”—caustically concluding how “[i]
n front of such a work, such a victory over the reality of disorder, over the pettiness
of the heart and the mind, it is hard not to go and hang yourself” (Beckett 2011;
italics mine). Beckett’s distrust in formal means of understanding reality, of ordering
its chaotic behaviour, starkly contrasts with his precocious and sustained interest in
mathematics (Ackerley 1998), physics (notably thermodynamics and the idea of
entropy; Duffy 2013; Harrington 1982), and science in general (Ackerley 2010), an
interest that is undeniably mirrored in the formal qualities of his narrative work. The
modelling dichotomy between randomness and order is therefore reﬂected once
more in the tension between Beckett’s emphasis on the chaotic nature of reality
and the formal features of his narratives. As Chris Ackerley observes, while charting
Beckett’s interest in scientiﬁc ideas and problems, “any attempt . . . to saddle Beckett
with a scientiﬁc temperament, let alone a scientiﬁc methodology, runs into an
impasse generated by Beckett’s deep distrust of the rational process” (Ackerley
2010, p. 144).
My answer to this paradoxical tension is that, with respect to the mind’s complex-
ity, Beckett employed a formal, highly sophisticated modelling strategy in order to
approach, disclose, and let the reader perceive the complex chaotic behaviour lying
beyond and before the emergent unifying dynamic of conscious experience. What I
call Beckett’s ﬁctional cognitive modelling of the mind’s complexity can therefore be
described as a formal “exploration” (a term that I return to in the conclusion of the
essay) of the key components responsible for the emergent feeling of order in our
subjective experience. As we see in the next sections, that unifying feeling is to a
signiﬁcant extent a narrative emergent outcome of complex interactions at the level of
the mind’s complexity. As such, our narrative sense of selfhood it is an emergent
property that conceals its complex origins.

Beyond and Before Emergence: Experiential Art
and Narratives of Centralised Control
The narrative we tell about ourselves as a uniﬁed, integrated, single, temporally
consistent and causally coherent centre of experience is a speciﬁc case (we could
even say the “cognitive matrix” of) what Porter Abbott deﬁned, in his landmark
article on the limits of narrative understanding of emergent behaviour, the “narrative
of centralized control” (Abbott 2008, p. 231). To recapitulate the key points in
Abbott’s article, he suggests that there is an “incompatibility of emergent behaviour
with narrative understanding” due to the “massive distribution of causal agents”
(p. 227) of the former. Abbott clearly concedes that we are able to manage a certain
degree of causal complexity in literary and real life narratives. Yet he proposes that,
as soon as complexity increases such as in complex systems, our coping strategy is to
project a “default narrative of centralised control” (p. 236) in order to explain
17

237

emergent behaviour. This does not mean that we cannot narratively describe the
perceptible effects of emergent behaviour in complex systems. We can, for instance,
narratively report the story of the aerial ballet performed by a ﬂock of birds, Abbott
says; but we do so “without any reference to the emergent process that bring them
into being” (p. 236). When it comes to emergent patterns and behaviours, Abbott
concludes, we face a “void of unnarratibility” (p. 236) to which we respond with
illusory narratives of centralised control. In other words, we are narratively stuck in
the aboutness of complexity, of which this class of narrative provides only a feeling
of understanding, with neither access to the actual components of the system nor to
the emergent transition that leads to emergent behaviour.
Interestingly, Abbott is a foremost scholar of Beckett, whose work seems to
provide a challenging counterexample to Abbott’s argument insofar as it entirely
resists narratives of centralised control. This resistance has to be intended both as a
resistance on the part of Beckett to create centralised narratives and as a consequen-
tial impossibility for the reader to project this default narrative mode of understand-
ing. In his more recent monograph, signiﬁcantly titled Real Mysteries: Narrative and
the Unknowable, Abbott points in this direction by classing Beckett’s work as
“reader-resistant” narratives, which give us “experiential knowledge of our igno-
rance about who we are” (Abbott 2014, p. 40). As much as I endorse Abbott’s idea of
Beckett’s work as a “reader-resistant” narrative (a narrative opacity that, impor-
tantly, Abbott previously assigned to complex systems), my argument is that this
resistance is a positive result of Beckett’s modelling strategy of the mind’s com-
plexity. It is precisely because he has been able to disassemble the emergent
narrative sense of self (the cognitive matrix of all narrative of centralised control)
into its key components (which I address in the next two sections)—interacting and
operating at the level of the mind’s complexity—that we can experience what lies
beyond and before this uniﬁed emergent level.
The feeling of ignorance of which Abbott speaks is due to the fact that Beckett’s
work presents the key components of mind’s complexity in the process of interac-
tion, before and beyond their emergent narrative outcome. In doing so, he models the
very cognitive processes resulting in the emergent matrix of centralised control that
gives us a (partly narrative) feeling of order about experience. This is why our
default mode of narrative understanding fails when we encounter Beckett’s work.
Expecting, as readers, to be able to make sense of the events by projecting a narrative
thread, we face instead the key components of our narrative understanding. If we do
not recognise these components as part of our experience it is because their interac-
tion usually goes on unperceived. In a way, our habit to succeed in casting narrative
threads upon events is a precondition for Beckett’s ﬁctional cognitive models to
work. It is the failure of our narrative habit that allows us to experience Beckett’s
narrative models as something new—something located at the level of the mind’s
complex interactions, which precedes (and therefore resists) the narrative grasp of
our everyday inner experience.
Beckett’s cognitive models complicate Lewandosky and Farrell’s deﬁnition
according to which models “retain the essential features of the system”, insofar as
they retain the features of the cognitive system that at the same time they target and
238
M. Bernini

are shaped by: the human mind’s complex components. Put in Beckett’s terms, we
can say of his narrative work what he positively noted about the work of his friend
and painter Avigdor Arika. When trying to explore the complex inner relations
amongst the mind’s components, “in his work, these intimate relations retain the
speciﬁc character of the frame within which they are formed” (Beckett 2011, p. 84).
To the question of how a writer can internally access these inner relations, operating
before and beyond the emergent narrative that uniﬁes and conceals their complexity,
my answer is “simply” by introspecting. The limits of introspective methods have
been repeatedly pointed out throughout the history of psychological and cognitive
research (Butler 2013; Hurlburt and Schwitzgebel 2007). My contention is that
Beckett’s ﬁctional cognitive modelling shows how narrative devices can be turned
into tools for overcoming the limitations of a narrative introspective report of inner
experience. And even more when it comes to modelling the elements responsible for
the emergence of a narrative sense of self, which is the matrix of our everyday
narrative understanding.
Together with armchair introspection, in fact, it is by the very process of creating
narrative worlds (which is the novelist’s business) that they can gather information
about the key elements by which a narrative is formed, our narrative sense of self
included. The gathered information could then be turned into a model which, more
and less than in an analogy, retains the features of the cognitive process it addresses.
As Alva Noë points out in his enactivist study on perception, “[i]t is not pictures as
objects of perception that can teach us about perceiving; rather, it is making
pictures—that is, the skillful construction of pictures—that can illuminate experi-
ence itself, or rather, the making or enacting of experience” (Noë 2004, p. 179).
Similarly, in order to access the complex making of our narrative sense of self that is
usually an emergent process transparent to us, we should not look at its products
(narratives of aboutness), but rather enact the emergent process of its creation. And
given the functional similarity between cognitive and literary storytelling, writers are
extremely well-placed to provide insights and ﬁctional models for exploring the
complex nature of narrative emergences. Alva Noë brieﬂy gestures at a possible role
of art in accessing aspects of experience usually transparent to us—in our case the
emergent unifying activity through which our (richly narrative) conscious experi-
ence is shaped. The task of this kind of art, that Noë calls “experiential art”, is “not so
much to depict or represent or describe experience, but rather to catch experience in
the act of making the world available . . . The aim of experiential art and phenom-
enology ought to be . . . to draw attention to an activity that, by dint of the fact that we
can perceive, we are very good at it” (p. 177; italics mine). In spite of our being very
good at and accustomed to narrating our story to ourselves and to others, however,
we are usually blind to the complexity underlying this process. This is why we need
experiential art, to draw attention to this activity in order to catch the process in the
making. Once we have captured the key elements of the process, its modelling can be
a further step, enabling a more formal exploration of its hidden complex interactions,
which is exactly what I maintain Beckett achieved in his narrative work. To better
grasp the structures and elements of Beckett’s ﬁctional cognitive models, we ﬁrst
need a more complex deﬁnition of the processes his models are investigating.

A Complex Deﬁnition of Mind, Narrative
and the Narrative Sense of Self
The path leading from brain activity to our subjective experience and mental states is
intricate, mysterious and full of gaps in our understanding of it. How can physical
interactions at the neuronal level generate mental states? This question has been (pre)
occupying philosophers of mind and cognitive scientists for centuries. The problem,
which harks back to Plato, found a solution (today harshly criticised) in the Cartesian
dualistic view of a split between the body (res extensa) and the mind (res cogitans),
which Joseph Levine more recently labelled the “explanatory gap” (Levine 1983).
The inexplicability of this gap is plainly illustrated in a passage from Beckett’s novel
Murphy, in which the homonymous protagonist indulges in the pleasure of intro-
spection: “[t]hus Murphy felt himself split in two, a body and a mind. They had
intercourse apparently, otherwise he could not have known that they had anything in
common. But he felt his mind bodytight and did not understand through what
channel the intercourse was effected nor how the two experiences came to overlap.
He was satisﬁed that neither followed from the other” (2009b, p. 70). Today we
know there is not a single “channel”, like the Cartesian pineal gland, that can explain
the transition from the physical to the mental. This kind of negative knowledge,
however, does not cancel out the gap, which substantially remains to be explained.
One scientiﬁc way of proceeding is to look at correlations between our phenom-
enal conscious states and neural activity at the brain level. Tononi and Edelman
pioneered this kind of approach to the explanatory gap by suggesting that “analyzing
the convergence between . . . phenomenological and neural properties can yield
valuable insights into the kinds of neural processes that can account for the
corresponding properties of conscious experience” (1998, p. 1850). Their study
corroborated the idea that “changes in a speciﬁc aspect of conscious experience
correlate with changes in speciﬁc brain areas whether the experience is driven by
external stimuli, by memory, or by imagery and dreams” (p. 1847). More speciﬁ-
cally, they discovered that the uniﬁed nature of our conscious states is the result of a
corresponding integration (that they call “functional clustering”) of speciﬁc neuronal
groups interacting at the level of the brain’s complexity. They call this large cluster
of neurons (which is not a ﬁxed set, but nonetheless would usually include posterior
corticothalamic regions), together constituting the uniﬁed neural process from which
our conscious states emerge, the “dynamic core” of consciousness. The “dynamic
core” is a functional cluster, a process of aggregation of key neural components
whose complex global activity generates patterns that are the neural counterpart of
our conscious states.
These ﬁndings are of great signiﬁcance for understanding how neural complexity
at the brain level gives rise to the emergent level of mental states. This said, as Philip
Clayton points out, “if explanations are given exclusively in neurological terms, they
will be by the nature of the case not able to specify what are the phenomenal
experiences or qualia the subjects experience” (2004, p. 120). In other words,
from the brain’s complexity emerges the mind’s complexity, a further level of
240
M. Bernini

complexity that cannot be explained in neural terms. Importantly, the mind’s
complexity in turn can generate further emergences, from more primitive forms of
awareness to higher order emergent phenomena such as our narrative sense of self.
And at the emerged level of the mind’s complexity, different kinds of clustering
might occur, resulting from the interaction of a variety of components in our
conscious experience. The question then becomes whether we can speak of a
different “dynamic core” at the mind’s level, from which higher orders of cognition
emerge?
If literary narratives—engaging with and building on introspective enquires into,
to quote Beckett’s Molloy, “the laws of the mind” (Beckett 2009c, p. 9)—cannot
access the neural complex level of conscious experience, they can approach (and, I
argue, model) what lies beyond the uniﬁed emerged level of our subjectivity. The
gap between the brain and the mind, in fact, is not just difﬁcult to bridge, but it is also
hard to graduate into a spectrum of multiple and successive emergences. What we
usually think of as our fully-ﬂedged indivisible subjectivity is in reality the last
emergent state in a multi-leveled trajectory rooted in the brain and continuously
generating new levels of complexity and subsequent emergences. From the brain’s
neural complexity more primitive states of mind emerge, with a minimal sense of
ownership and agency of the organism that corresponds to what phenomenologists
and cognitive scientists refer to as the “minimal self” (Gallagher 2000). This minimal
sense of self is far from the high-order, conceptually rich feeling of subjectivity that
we habitually experience as our self. On the other side, this minimal level of
awareness is a necessary complex platform in which interactions of conscious states
and components generate what Neisser has called the “extended self” (Neisser and
Fivush 1994), Damasio the “autobiographical self” (Damasio 1998), or more
broadly it is referred to as the “narrative self” (Schechtman 2011, 2007). This
description of the trajectory from the brain to the fully-ﬂedged self as a hierarchical
chain of emergences ﬁts with the account of emergence as a new macro-level of
organization of previous micro-level elements. To borrow Gazzaniga’s deﬁnition,
“[e]mergence is when micro-level complex systems that are far from equilibrium
(thus allowing for the ampliﬁcation of random events) self-organize (creative, self-
generated, adaptability-seeking behavior) into new structures, with new properties
that previously did not exist, to form a new level of organization at the macro-level”
(Gazzaniga 2012, p. 124). The autobiographical self can therefore be seen as the last
level of organisation in a sequence of progressive emergences. This level cannot be
accounted for in neural terms because, as Gazzaniga clariﬁes, “[t]he laws are not
universal to all levels of organization; it depends which level of organization you are
describing, and new rules apply when higher levels emerge” (p. 130). Logically, it
might be useful to look at the components and elements interacting at the previous
level in order to understand something of the emergent transition. In the case of the
emergence of our narrative, extended, autobiographical self, we should therefore ask
which kind of elements at the minimal-self level of complexity are triggering the
transition? Building on Edelman and Tononi’s hypothesis at the neural level, we can
ask which elements constitute what I would call the “narrative dynamic core” in the
mind’s complexity, whose global activity generates our rich sense of subjectivity?
17
Narrative and Cognitive Modelling: Insights from Beckett Exploring. . .
241

Narrative approaches to the self have been proliferating (for a survey see
Schechtman 2011) and sometimes bitterly criticised (Strawson 2004) in the last
few decades. Daniel Dennett famously suggested that the self is no more than a
narrative abstraction, a “centre of narrative gravity” that we posit as the ﬁctional
source of the stories we tell about our self (1991). Similarly, Bayne has suggested
that the self is a virtual centre of “phenomenal gravity”, around which we build
(partly narrative) representations of our self (2010, p. 289). An emergent approach to
the narrative sense of self, however, is still missing. For this to happen, we should
probably ﬁrst look for a more complex deﬁnition of narrative as an emergent
property itself. My argument is that Beckett’s ﬁctional cognitive modelling, by
addressing the emergent transition from a minimal self to an autobiographical self,
can help on both fronts. What I want to suggest is that Beckett, by introspectively
looking beyond the surface of our narratively uniﬁed sense of self, has been able to
identify and then model a possible “narrative dynamic core” from which our
narrative self emerges. In our everyday acquaintance with the world and with
ourselves we do not perceive the complexity underlying our uniﬁed experience,
and we accept our rich subjectivity as the ground (and not the emergent outcome) of
experience. Our mind’s complexity is usually invisible to us, and we feel narratively
uniﬁed into a self even if there is no single location in our brain or mind hosting
it. Moreover, none of the interacting components generating our higher subjectivity
are in themselves “selfy”. As Owen Flanagan explains, “[to] be sure, there is no
shadowy supervisor that is your CEO, and there is no nonshadowy central head-
quarters either. You are a complex system. Much of what makes you tick is neither
“selfy” nor transparent from the subjective point of view” (Flanagan 1998, p. 210;
italics mine). I want to suggest that Beckett’s ﬁctional cognitive models seem to aim
precisely at exploring how non-selfy components in the mind are able to generate, by
means of complex interaction, a narrative feeling of a temporally consistent and
coherent self. My idea is that Beckett, building on introspective insights, appears to
have singled out—a crucial moment in modelling—a restricted number of key
components responsible for the emergence of a narrative self. This functional cluster,
which I call the “narrative dynamic core”, is, I argue, the main object of Beckett’s
ﬁctional cognitive models. To anticipate the constitutive elements of the cognitive
cluster that I explain in detail in the next section, I elaborate on the idea that Beckett
modeled the construction of a narrative self as the emergent property of the complex
interaction between language, time, agents and imagination.1
1As one of the reviewers of this essay rightly noted, a number of other authors (e.g., Proust) might
be said to have ‘singled out’ these factors as crucial in the constitution of the Self and a variety of
mental states. The originality of Beckett’s manoeuvre, as the next section shows, consists rather in
his ‘modelling’ strategy and method, i.e., in the creation of narratives as models (abstract, simpliﬁed
forms that can be manipulated for different exploratory scopes).

The Narrative Dynamic Core and Kinds of Fictional
Cognitive Models
To model the narrative self as an emergent process means to make hypotheses about
the local elements (nodes) whose networking activity generates the self as an
emergent pattern. As summed up by Evan Thompson’s enactivist account of emer-
gence—quoted by Mackenzie (2011)—“[a]n emergent process belongs to an ensem-
ble or network of elements, arises spontaneously or self-organizes from the locally
deﬁned and globally constrained or controlled interactions of those elements, and
does not belong to a single element” (Thompson 2007, p. 60; italics mine). In this
perspective, the narrative self as an emergent process is therefore a distributed
activity that cannot be identiﬁed with a single element in the system. In Varela’s
words, “what we call ‘I’ can be analysed as arising out of our recursive linguistic
abilities and their unique capacity for self-description and narration” (Varela 1999,
p. 61). The role of language, however, should not be overemphasized or isolated as
the only element responsible for the emergence of a narrative self. The self is indeed
partly a semiotic process (Pickering 1999), but language is only one of the elements
involved in the complex networking activity through which the narrative self
emerges. Furthermore, we can think of language itself in complex terms, as Lee
et al. propose, considering it as a “multistrata of building blocks” or a “hierarchical
structure of agents” in which “phonemes form syllables, which then form mor-
phemes; morphemes form words, words form phrases, and the process continues,
until we end up with speech acts, stories, and so on” (Lee et al. 2009, p. 21). As we
will see in a moment, this idea that language itself might be disassembled into
building blocks is the object of one kind of model in Beckett’s work. Yet again,
language is just one of the elements composing what I am deﬁning as the “narrative
dynamic core” that Beckett has singled out as the functional cluster generating our
fully-ﬂedged sense of self. And language alone is not enough for a narrative self to
emerge. As already anticipated, the other elements that Beckett seems to have
selected for and targeted in his models are time, agents and imagination. Let me
cursorily outline each of these elements, before presenting concrete examples of
Beckett’s ﬁctional modelling of cognition.
Firstly, language itself can take many forms within our cognitive commerce with
the inner and outer worlds. It can be externally directed or internally and silently
condensed in what cognitive psychologists have called “inner speech” (for a com-
prehensive survey see Alderson-Day and Fernyhough 2015). Since Beckett’s models
often portray a voice from within, and since many of his ﬁctional worlds are isolated,
closed-off mental spaces, inner speech in his work should be regarded as one of the
more important aspects of language responsible for the emergence of a narrative self.
Moreover, to support this choice, cognitive science is increasingly suggesting that
inner speech has a fundamental role in the construction and monitoring of our self
(Morin and Everett 1990).
Time is clearly also a key component in any type of narrative, the narrative of our
self included. In human experience, however, we can distinguish two different types
17

243

of temporal cognitive processes. The ﬁrst, more basic type concerns what is usually
referred to in phenomenology, from Husserl onwards, as “time-consciousness”.
Time-consciousness is a micro-structure of our conscious experience which allows
us to perceive temporally extended objects. It does not entail reﬂective or self-
conscious thought about the temporality of experience at issue. Rather, it is a
precondition of our phenomenal experience of the world, the necessary ground for
perception to occur. As Gallagher and Zahavi explain, time-consciousness is a
“temporal binding” (2010, p. 73), a “temporal synthesis [which] is a precondition
for the perceptual synthesis” and which explains “how consciousness uniﬁes itself
across time” (p. 79). In other words, time-consciousness is the a priori, low-level
condition thanks to which we are living in a ﬂow of experiences as opposed to an
experiential pointillism. Time-consciousness is also the precondition of higher forms
of temporal integration (Freeman 2007), such as the temporally extended narration
resulting in our autobiographical self. Both types of temporality are targeted in
Beckett’s ﬁctional models, and are part of the narrative dynamic core.
The third element I referred to as “agents” is a narratological subcluster—which
is, as language and time, a complex one. As Jerome Bruner (2004), among others
(Bermúdez 2000), puts it, the narrative of our self “is, of course, a privileged but
troubled narrative in the sense that it is reﬂexive: the narrator and the central ﬁgure in
the narrative are the same. This reﬂexivity creates dilemmas” (Bruner 2004, p. 693).
In other words, the narratological agency in the structure of the narrative self is at the
same time singular and plural. We can also add, as Beckett does, a third agent, who is
the author responsible for authenticating (Doležel 1998) the narrator’s and the
character’s existence. In the emergent process resulting in our narrative self, the
paradox of a narratological singular plurality usually goes unnoticed. In Beckett’s
modelling, instead, the uniﬁed narration is disintegrated and disassembled, and we
can therefore access the role and complexity of this narratologically nested nucleus
within the narrative dynamic core.
Moving to the ﬁnal element, without imagination the very hypothesis of a
narrative self would be, pun intended, hard to imagine. The remembered past and
the anticipated future, as well as simulations involving counterfactual situations and
empathy towards other people (Goldman 2006), require a substantial degree of
imagination. In this respect, memories can be considered as a particular kind of
imaginative activity, closely interacting with other elements in the narrative dynamic
core. For instance, memories clearly support and involve our extended sense of time,
and often trigger or are triggered by our inner silent verbalizing.
Language, time, agents and imagination are, I argue, the components that Beckett
singled out as the narrative dynamic core whose complex interaction produces the
emergent transition leading to our narrative self. These components are either
targeted individually by his ﬁctional cognitive models, or modeled altogether in
their global interaction. I would therefore class the former kind of texts as local
models, and the latter as global models. I now bring some concrete examples of both
types in what remains of the essay. One last important remark, however, is due
before proceeding. Once created, models can be manipulated and even damaged to
see what happens to the system. As Lewandosky and Farrel note: “[u]nlike people,
244
M. Bernini

models can quite literally be taken apart. For example, we can “lesion” models to
observe the outcome on behavior of certain localized dysfunction . . . one can do
things to models that one cannot do to people, and . . . those lesioning experiments
can yield valuable knowledge” (2011, pp. 27—28; italics mine). This is precisely the
kind of use of models we can see operating in Beckett’s texts, which can hardly be
better described than as lesioning experiments.
Within local models, the ﬁrst example I would like to present, Imagination Dead
Imagine (1996), clearly manifests already from the title a lesioning nature towards
one of the elements in the narrative dynamic core. The text mainly targets the
interaction between two elements in the core—language and imagination—by
attempting to manipulate the former to lesion the latter. Here is the beginning of
the short prose:
No trace of life anywhere, you say, pah, no difﬁculty there, imagination not dead yet, yes,
dead, good, imagination dead imagine. Islands, waters, azure, verdure, one glimpse and
vanished, endlessly, omit. Till all white in the whiteness the rotunda. No way in, go in,
measure. Diameter three feet, three feet from ground to summit of the vault. Two diameters
at right angles AB CD divide the white ground into two semicircles ACB BDA. Lying on the
ground two white bodies, each in its semicircle . . .. The light that makes all so white no
visible source, all shines with the same white shine, ground, wall, vault, bodies, no shadow
. . .. Emptiness, silence, heat, whiteness, wait, the light goes down, all grows dark together,
ground, wall, vault, bodies, say twenty seconds, all the greys, the light goes out, all vanishes.
At the same time the temperature goes down, to reach its minimum, say freezing-point. . ..
(Beckett 1996, p. 182; italics mine)
This narrative beginning is representative of the tension between Beckett’s formal
modelling strategy (in this text chieﬂy geometrical) and the chaotic dynamics it aims
to disclose. The entire text is an attempt to make the imaginative activity stall. The
problem is that lesioning imagination by manipulating language is hard to achieve,
since the binding of language and imagination in the narrative dynamic core is tight
and constantly activated. Here is where formal modelling can become a necessity, in
order to reach a use of language and narrative structures directed at reducing
imagination to a bare-bones condition, then hopefully loosening its integration
with language and letting both fall apart. If language functionally needs to form a
cluster with imagination to generate meanings (and ﬁctional worlds), in this text
language is used to restrict the clustering by linguistically articulating the end of
imagination. As the ﬁrst few lines foreground, the unavoidable pitfall is that this
uncoupling itself needs to be imagined. A further move is therefore to create a highly
formalised narrative situation, in which the other elements in the narrative dynamic
core are also reduced to a minimum of activation. The hardly imaginable image of
two unnamed white bodies lying on a white ground and completely still deactivates
as much as possible the “agent” element. Also the time dimension, like the temper-
ature, approximates the “freezing point”. Yet, “imagination not dead yet”, and the
“the absence in perfect voids” (p. 184) that later in the text is hoped for is impossible
to realise because even the growing dark activates imagination. The positive out-
come of this unsuccessful lesioning, however, is to discover, explore and let the
17

245

reader experience the indissoluble clustering of two key elements in the narrative
dynamic core.
Another case of the local model similarly aiming at lesioning the co-activation of
language and imagination is the 1983 short prose Worstward Ho (2009a). The
analogies with Imagination Dead Imagine are evident from the very beginning of
this further lesioning experiment:
On. Say on. Be said on. Somehow on. Till nohow on. Said nohow on.
Say for be said. Missaid. From now say for be missaid.
Say a body. Where none. No mind. Where none. That at least. A place. Where none. For the
body. To be in. Move in. Out of. Back into. No. No out. No back. Only in. Stay in. On
in. Still.
All of old. Nothing else ever. Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail
better. (Beckett 2009a, p. 81; italics mine)
As in the previous modelling example, language is used once again to deﬂate
imagination, this time by means of neologisms, syntactical oppositions and repeated
negations of what has just been said. Neologisms and syntactical oppositions
(in italics) are of particular interest here in relation to the idea, mentioned earlier in
this section, of language as a complex agglomerate of building blocks (phonemes,
syllables, morphemes, words, sentences). In order to understand, from a complex
system perspective, the use of neologisms and syntactical oppositions in this pas-
sage, it might be worth introducing John Holland’s description of complex adaptive
systems as an interaction of “signals” and “boundaries” (2014).
In a complex system, Holland elucidates, “the network’s nodes represent
bounded entities (species, neurons, organelles) and the connections between nodes
represent the ﬂow of signals between entities” (2014, p. 7). Within what I have
deﬁned as the narrative dynamic core, all the four key elements have their own
boundaries, from which they can signal each other—as in the constant signaling
between language and imagination in the previous text. In complex systems, though,
“because there are niches within niches, web-like hierarchies result. In signal/
boundary terms, there is a hierarchy of enclosing boundaries, with matching signals
at each level” (p. 16). Language, in this view, has its own internal boundaries and
internal signaling. In Beckett’s local model, neologisms (“missaid”) and syntactical
oppositions (“nohow on”; “fail better”) create a mismatching signaling between
words’ boundaries. The resulting conﬂicting signals arising from the juncture of
negative (“nohow”; “fail”) and positive linguistic particles (“on”; “better”) are then
undermining the link with, and the activation of, the imagination node. With
negations (e.g., “Say a body. Where none”) we face a similar conﬂicting signaling,
only at the larger boundary level of sentences. In both cases, the signals reaching the
imagination boundary are in this way almost simultaneously cuing creative and
deactivating stimuli. But once again, the production of a dysfunction in the coordi-
nation and interaction of two elements in the narrative dynamic core can disclose
some knowledge about the inseparability of this cognitive coupling as well as about
the nature, constitution and behaviour of the core itself.
246
M. Bernini

Passing from a local to a global cognitive model in Beckett’s work, Company
(2009a) is a prime example of a text in which at issue is the global activity, the
complex signaling and the interacting boundaries of all the elements in the narrative
functional cluster. The text is the story of a voice coming to the only amnesic
character (but not the only agent) in the dark of an unformed ﬁctional world. The
voice retells, in a non-chronological order, ﬁfteen past scenes from the character’s
life, trying to force him to recognise these memories as his personal story (“To
confess, Yes I remember” p. 9). Here it is how the text begins:
A voice comes to one in the dark. Imagine.
To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how
the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again . . .. To one
on his back in the dark a voice tells of a past. With occasional allusion to a present and
more rarely to a future as for example, You will end as you now are.
Use of the second person marks the voice. That of the third the cankerous other. Could he
speak to and of whom the voice speaks there would be a ﬁrst. But he cannot. He shall not.
You cannot. You shall not. (Beckett 2009a, p. 3).
To anticipate my interpretation, I want to suggest a reading of the text as a model
of the narrative dynamic core whose global activity generates a narrative self. The
“one in the dark”, amnesic and endowed with just a proprioceptive sense of self
(“Your mind never active at any time is now even less than ever so” p. 4) and time-
consciousness (he is able to perceive a continuity in the movement of the voice), is a
“minimal self” before and beyond the emergent narrative transition that would lead
him into a fully ﬂedged identity (Bernini 2014). In order for the transition to occur,
all the elements in the dynamic core have to cluster and interact.
Starting from the narratological components, in the quoted passage the narrato-
logical agents (character, narrator, author) of the core are already presented through
their indexical position. The character, not yet emerged into a linguistic and narrative
self, still cannot speak at all, being a pure embodied indexical presence. The narrator
speaks in the second person, trying to encode memories into the recalcitrant mind of
the character (“To have the hearer to have a past and acknowledge it. You were born
on an Easter Friday after long labour. Yes I remember.” p. 22). The author (“the
cankerous other”), predictably, employs the third person. The three positions,
however, are continuously shifted, in order to let the reader perceive the singular
plurality of the narratological agents in the creation of a narrative self. The author,
we are told at a certain point, is the single yet divided source of the narrative, the “[d]
eviser of the voice and of its hearer and of himself” (p. 16). In other words, “[h]e
speaks of himself as another” (in the third person; italics mine) and, as the deviser of
the voice, he speaks to himself (in the second person). Recalling the role of inner
speech in the constantly ongoing narration in our mind, the memories retold about
and to the author as a character can be interpreted as a modelling of inner speech in
the narrative dynamic core.
17

247

As for the imagination node in the core, the retelling of memories by the voice is
constantly presented as a “stretch of imagining” (p. 28) wearing and tiring the hearer,
till the moment he will admit to remembering (“[b]loom of adulthood. Imagine a
whiff of that. Ah you remember. Cloudless May day.” p. 25). As for the time
component, the encoding of memories as part of the activity in the core should
reach the goal of temporally extending the self beyond his minimal sense of time-
consciousness. To sum up, the text can be seen as a modelling of the emergent
transition from a minimal self to an autobiographical self (Bernini 2015), operated
by the interaction and co-aggregation of all the elements in the narrative dynamic
core. There are actually also traces of this modelling procedure within the text, when
the author evaluates how to ameliorate the modelling, for instance by improving the
voice (“Might not the voice be improved?” p. 21) or the hearer (“Would it be
reasonable to imagine the hearer quite inert?” p. 33). Like the previous local models,
however, also this global model presents moments of lesioning, such as when the
voice, after trying to extend the temporal existence of the character, negates to him
any kind of future changes in the situation (“You will end as you now are” p. 3).
Once again, this lesioning can provide valuable insights about the functioning of the
building blocks (here the temporal one) in the narrative dynamic core.
In Company, all the nodes are active and interacting from their respective and
highly formalised boundaries, casting signals that should in the end generate the ﬂow
of a narrative sense of self. As already mentioned, the elements in the narrative
dynamic core operating in the mind’s complexity are structurally similar to the
components of a ﬁctional narrative in general. This is why Beckett, combining
introspective insights with narratological expertise, has been able to model, explore
and let the reader perceive what lies before and beyond the uniﬁed integrating
dynamics that gives rise to our rich subjectivity. In a sentence, he has been able to
approximate the edge of mind’s complexity (that is close to the “edge of sense”
Walsh (Chap. 5) auspicates for narratives dealing with complexity), which usually
conceals itself.

Conclusion
To conclude, in this essay I have tried to show how a speciﬁc kind of complex
system (the mind) has been the object of exploration of what I have called Beckett’s
ﬁctional cognitive models. Either locally or globally, Beckett’s models target the
activity of key elements in our mind, whose global interaction is responsible for the
emergence of our narrative sense of selfhood. These models clearly do not allow
prediction or scientiﬁc explanation. Rather, they can be described as what Holland
calls “exploratory models”, which typically “start with a designated set of
248
M. Bernini

mechanisms, such as the various bonds between amino acids, with the objective of
ﬁnding out what can happen when these mechanisms interact” (2014, p. 43). In
Beckett’s case, the designated set of mechanisms he has selected is what I have
called the “narrative dynamic core”, the functional cluster aggregating language,
time, agency and imagination. I argued that he has been able to make this modelling
selection within the mind’s complexity by means of introspective analysis or, as
Beckett calls it in another letter to Duthuit in 1949, a “little session of autology, amid
greedy sounds of suction” (2011, p. 139). If I am right, Beckett’s work might
constitute an exception to the limit of a narrative approach to complexity. As such,
it could be regarded in itself as a model of a narrative method to be developed
further, in a future where literature can occupy a proper position in the investigation
and exploration of complex systems.

Narratives for Drug Design
James Bown and Alexey Goltsov
Abstract We explore the role of narratives of complex systems in anti-cancer drug
design. We set out the value of narratives relating to cancer in promoting awareness
of risky behaviour and in supporting decision-making regarding treatment options.
We present cancer as a dysregulated, complex system that has emergent behaviours
at multiple scales, and is governed by dynamical spatio-temporal processes. We
show that this system changes structure and function in response to anti-cancer
drugs, and explain that these changes are sufﬁciently complex to impede effective
drug design. We pose what narrative might offer to support the process of drug
design, providing an example of work done to date that might serve as a foundation
for narrating complexity. We suggest ways of using this work combined with that of
others to begin to consider narrating drug design.

Narratives and Cancer Patients
The management of patients with long-term conditions is one of the major chal-
lenges facing healthcare systems worldwide (United Nations General Assembly
2013). A long-term condition is a condition for which there is no cure; rather,
long-term conditions must be managed through a range of treatment options includ-
ing drugs (King’s Fund 2012). Long-term conditions include diabetes, hypertension,
chronic kidney disease and cancer, and management of these conditions accounts for
a substantial proportion of health service resources. For example, in the UK long-
term condition patients account for 30% of the patient population and 70% of the
healthcare spend (Department of Health 2012).

Patients living with long-term conditions play an important role in management
of their condition, and Coulter et al. (2015) provide a comprehensive review of the
role of personal care planning in the management of long-term conditions. They
describe personal care planning as a “collaborative process used in chronic condition
management in which patients and clinicians identify and discuss problems caused
by or related to the patient’s condition, and develop a plan for tackling these”
(Coulter et al. 2015). For personal care planning to be effective, patients must be
supported in the difﬁcult decisions they make in respect of lifestyle choices and
treatment options.
Cancer is one of the fastest rising long-term conditions (Department of Health
2012) and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There were approximately
8 million deaths recorded in 2012 and a 70% rise in new cases expected over the next
20 years (Stewart and Wild 2014).
Narrative has been shown to have value in the prevention of cancer through
effective communication of risk. Janssen et al. (2013) provide a useful review of
narrative in healthcare, noting that “by providing vivid information about the
antecedents and the consequences of a health problem, narrative health information
improves the extent to which people are able to imagine themselves developing a
certain disease, which in turn may inﬂuence their risk judgments” (Janssen et al.
2013). Their own study explored the effects of risk communication to regular sunbed
users in narrative and non-narrative forms. Results showed that, compared with
non-narrative information forms, narrative information promoted an increased feel-
ing of skin cancer risk with respect to sunbed use in participants, and participants
could more readily imagine themselves developing skin cancer.
Narratives can also support patients when making decisions on treatment options.
Shaffer et al. (2013) report on the effect of process-focused and experience-focused
narratives on the patient decision-making process. Process narratives are designed to
“prime participants to follow a particular decision process . . . [and] would most
commonly entail patients considering additional dimensions of the decision process
that they might not have considered otherwise” Shaffer et al. (2013). Experience
narratives are designed to “increase knowledge and the perceived ability to imagine
future health states . . . [which] could result in increased decisional satisfaction and
an improved ability to make affective forecasts (i.e., forecasts of future feelings)”
Shaffer et al. (2013). Importantly, neither process nor experience narratives are
thought to bias healthcare decisions, but to promote consideration of a broader set
of issues than they might have otherwise or improve understanding of treatment
outcome respectively. Focusing on breast cancer treatment decisions, and through a
carefully designed test with control conditions, results of the study revealed that
participants exposed to process-focused narratives spent more time searching for
information relating to key aspects of treatment that were discussed in the narratives.
Participants exposed to experience-focused narratives were more conﬁdent in and
satisﬁed with their treatment decisions.
We propose that narrative can also inform clinicians’ understanding of cancer.
We base this proposition on the following observations: (1) cancer is a complex
system; (2) effective drug design depends on understanding that complex system;
254
J. Bown and A. Goltsov

and (3) narratives can inform our understanding of complex systems. The remainder
of this chapter explores this proposition by unpacking these three observations
in turn.
In Sect. 2 we consider cancer as a complex system. We unpack some of the
complexities associated with cancer as a system of interacting cells in the context of
normal tissue. We pay particular attention to one level of functioning in cancer cells
– that of the intracellular signalling network that represents the biochemical inter-
actions among different species in the cell. It is these biochemical interactions that
ultimately dictate cell fate.
In Sect. 3 we explore this signalling network in the context of anti-cancer drug
targets. Because of their role in cell fate, some signalling network components
provide potentially useful drug targets for anti-cancer therapy. However, these
drug targets are situated in the context of a topologically complex and dynamic
network. We consider how anti-cancer drugs seek to restore normal functioning in
cell signalling networks, and explore how therapy design is impeded by the com-
plexity of the cellular system.
In Sect. 4 we set out what narrative might offer to support the process of drug
design, both providing an example of work done to date that might serve as a
foundation for narrating complexity and speculating on the contribution of narrative
to anti-cancer treatment.
In the Conclusion we suggest possible ways of using this work combined with
that of others to begin to consider narrating drug design.

Cancer as a Complex System
Cancer is not a single disease; it is a broad class of diseases of over 200 types
(Cancer Research UK 2016), characterised by functional dysregulations within and
surrounding affected cells, tissues and organs (Bown et al. 2012) as outlined in
subsequent sections. Cancer originates from the aberrant behaviour of a single cell or
region of cells that over time gives rise to an observable anomalous tissue structure in
the form of a tumour, and can progress to non-local spread through the blood stream
or lymphatic system.
Cancer is therefore an emergent system where local (cell) scale processes lead to
system-scale patterns in local cell populations, tissue structures, organs and ulti-
mately in the body as a whole. As explored below, those tissue patterns in turn
impact cellular processes. Moreover, there is increasing awareness of the heteroge-
neities in cancer: tumours comprise multiple cell types; patterning in tissue is
likewise heterogeneous. That cancer is emergent at multiple scales and highly
heterogeneous makes treatment very challenging.
In 2000, Hanahan and Weinburg (2000) set out six biological hallmarks of cancer
that have helped frame investigations and interpretation of ﬁndings; these hallmarks
provide a contextual backdrop to the challenge of drug design. Here, these are brieﬂy
18

outlined, and indeed greatly simpliﬁed. Hanahan and Weinburg (2000) provide a
rich description of all six hallmarks for the interested reader.
Normal cells regulate the processes of growth and division and pre-programmed
cell death, responding to spatially and temporally structured external signals that cue
the cell to grow, and to information on mechanical stresses from the environment
and from other cells (note that there are a wide range of other factors involved). In
effect, external signals are read in through receptors on the cell wall and processed
by the cell to drive behaviour. This cellular processing enables tissue to maintain
consistent and properly functioning structures.
Cancer arises from perturbations in the processing of these signals, and such
perturbations can lead to cells that are not well regulated by external stimuli. This
dysregulation can confer cells with one or more of the six hallmarks of cancer:
•
Increased proliferation, where cells divide far more frequently than they should;
•
Unsuppressed growth, where cancer cells can grow in structural forms inconsis-
tent with normal tissue (e.g., where mechanical pressures are larger);
•
Resistance to cell death, a natural and pre-programmed mechanism to promote
cell turnover and maintain a healthy population of cells;
•
Replicative immortality, through a combination of the above three hallmarks and
through changes in the mechanisms cells use to control the number of possible
divisions;
•
Sustained angiogenesis, meaning that cancerous tissue can encourage develop-
ment of structures able to supply oxygen and nutrients;
•
Invasion and metastasis, where tumour masses can move into adjacent tissue and
into distant regions by changing the physical coupling of cancer cells to their
microenvironment.
Tumours thus originate from and are sustained by dysregulations within the
signal processing within the cell, which confer on that cell particular ecological
and/or evolutionary advantages. The resulting pattern at the tissue scale is the
emerging tumour of cancer cells in the environmental context of normal tissue. An
important observation is that cross-scale feedback occurs through competition for
resource and space. Resource competition occurs because there is limited oxygen
and nutrients yet there are increasingly more cells in the developing cancerous tissue
structure. This growth is occurring in a limited space and the mechanical stresses on
cells caused by too much growth in too little space are converted into biochemical
signals and can actually promote further signal transduction; these stresses drive
proliferation over time (see Jaalouk and Lammerding 2009 for a review).
Kreeger and Lauffenburger (2009) provide an excellent review on the challenges
posed when trying to unravel both the origins and consequences of such
dysregulation in cancer cells. A key observation is that cell behaviour is controlled
by a mix of genetic alterations and environmental context, and that the “greatest
amount of information concerning phenotypic behaviour resides in the realm
comprehending both genomic and environmental effects: dynamic protein network
operations” (Kreeger and Lauffenburger 2009).

These protein networks, or signalling networks, provide a mechanistic connection
between external signals received at the cell surface and the cell nucleus (Cooper
2000). These signalling networks represent the biochemical species that interact to
form new compounds in order to process external signals. The nodes in the network
represent the compounds that are formed and broken down in space over time as the
cell processes extracellular signals and it is the result of these processes that drives
the behaviour of the cell.
Signals propagate through these networks, and cancerous behaviours, i.e., the
hallmarks, are often associated with measurable differences in the proteins that make
up these pathways. Accordingly, amongst the myriad levels of organisation of
cellular, tissue and environmental factors, signalling networks are a promising
route for drug design. However, signalling networks themselves attract complexities.
3
Signalling Networks and Anti-Cancer Drug Design
As noted above, signalling networks transduct external stimuli, including growth
factors and anti-cancer drugs, for processing by the cell nucleus. Importantly, these
networks do not operate in isolation; networks are interconnected and this compli-
cates their study.
Figure 18.1 (from Hu et al. 2013) is illustrative of such a network, and shows two
key, interconnected signalling pathways that are implicated in some of the hallmarks
of cancer: pre-programmed cell death, cell proliferation and cell growth. These
pathways are regulated by growth factor receptors (HER2 and HER3 in Fig. 18.1).
These two receptors regulate signalling in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathways that control cell survival, growth and proliferation. The details of the
molecular species that comprise this network are beyond the scope of this chapter.
Important here are several topological features that give rise to complex, emergent
behaviours. Note these features are a deﬁning property of many signalling networks
in biological sciences (Bown et al. 2012): complexity arising from network topology
is prevalent and not limited to this exemplar network or indeed to cancer.
Figure 18.1 shows pathway cross-talk and feedback loops, within and between
networks. Cross-talk is shown towards the centre of the network by the PP2A
enzyme, a known regulator of a wide range of cellular processes. This enzyme is
connected to the AKT-PIP3 complex, which drives cell survival and growth, and the
MEK complex, implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation among other
processes. A cell has a limited amount of PP2A at any one time, and in this particular
cross-talk example an increase in signalling activity in one pathway that interacts
with this limited amount of PP2A causes an inhibition of signalling activity in the
other pathway. Cross-activation, rather than the cross-inhibition shown here, is also
observed in other pathways.
Signalling is further complicated by the feedback loops shown in the network
(Fig. 18.1, dotted lines). Feedback loops are another pervasive feature of biological
networks. Feedback loops have a regulatory role in such networks, helping to keep
18

some intracellular conditions constant in the face of any perturbation. This network
describes oscillations in AKT and ERK signalling pathway outputs, and these
oscillations can be controlled by varying the strengths of the feedback loops in the
networks.
These topological complexities on the one hand provide signalling networks with
marked robustness to external stimuli, maintaining proper functioning in the face of
Fig. 18.1 Cellular signalling pathways (reproduced from Hu et al. 2013). The two pathways
RAF/MEK/ERK (left hand side) and PI3K/PTEN/AKT (right hand side) are interconnected by
element PP2A. RM1 shows a feedback loop. Additional cross-talk is shown by RM3 and RM4.

2013)

noisy inputs, yet on the other hand confer exquisite sensitivity to key variations in
those inputs. Accordingly, networks can be either sensitive or resistant to small
changes in input signals: sensitivity means that small, localised changes can have a
pronounced impact on non-local network functioning; resistance means that network
functioning is resilient to such change.
This emergent phenomenon has implications in anti-cancer drug design (see
below) but also in cancer-associated mutations. Figure 18.2 (from Goltsov et al.
2014) shows the impact of a cancer-associated mutation on network sensitivity in the
form of a heatmap. The heatmap shows the sensitivity of 19 different entities in the
signalling network, where light grey indicates high sensitivity and dark grey indi-
cates low sensitivity, i.e., resistance. In normal functioning (Column 1 in Fig. 18.2),
the network sensitivity heatmap is mainly mid to light grey, indicating a network that
is sensitive to change but not dramatically so. Mutations can be introduced into the
model to represent biological mutations in the cell. One single mutation in a key
network node results in a network that is largely insensitive to change (Column 3 in
Fig. 18.2 is mainly dark grey and black), i.e., a local change results in a marked
non-local change in sensitivity.
To complicate cellular signalling further still, there is an increasing awareness
that the network topology itself is not ﬁxed (Lee et al. 2012). The network topology
represents the interactions among different species in the cell, and the network
changes in structure over time. These changes occur because different parts of the
network interconnect and disconnect as the cell responds to acquired mutations and
signiﬁcant changes to external stimuli such as anti-cancer drug treatments. For
example, a cell can become resistant to the effect of a drug through these changes.
Anti-cancer drug treatments are typically in the form of a “targeted cancer
therapy”, a kind of therapy that is designed to disrupt aberrant behaviour in cellular
signalling networks, either in an effort to restore normal functioning or to at least
suppress cancerous behaviours in cells, by targeting a particular node in the network.
Drugs are typically designed in a single-target-single-drug paradigm (Medina-Franco
et al. 2013), i.e., a drug is designed to target a speciﬁc site in a network. However,
single therapies have had only limited success (Singer et al. 2008), with patients either
failing to respond at all, or developing resistance to the drug effect over time.
This is, in part, because the single therapies are acting in the context of a range of
mechanisms that compensate for and adapt to perturbations (here, drug action): these
mechanisms include cross-talk, feedback loops, differential sensitivities to change
across the network and changes in network structure in response to drug action. This
means that targeted therapies can impact beyond their point of application, and often
in ways that are difﬁcult to anticipate (Bown et al. 2017). These features then limit
efﬁcacy of any single therapy, and patient resistance to a drug is a key challenge in
anti-cancer therapy design.
There is increasing evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies that combina-
tion therapy, i.e., therapy comprising more than one drug and so target more than one
site in the network, is a promising route to overcome the challenge of drug resis-
tance. This evidence base is growing continually (Chandarlapaty 2012; Chong and
Jänne 2013) but typically the way in which the drugs work together to deliver
improved performance is not well understood (Goltsov et al. 2014). The rational

functioning, and when an anti-cancer drug is applied the network increases in overall sensitivity (Column 2). When a cancer-associated mutation is introduced
the network is insensitive without or with the anti-cancer drug (Columns 3 and 4 respectively). The addition of a second drug in combination with the ﬁrst

260

design of combination therapy depends on a mechanistic understanding of those
networks in terms of the individual components and the way in which those
components interact, locally and non-locally. Rational design needs ways of inte-
grating often fragmented data that together reﬂect the system as a whole, or at least
some representative subset of that system, and then of interpreting the results of that
integration.
The complexity of that integration provides an opportunity for computational
models. Models can identify signalling network states that confer drug resistance or
sensitivity and shed light on how to manage the transition from one state to the other
through combination therapy, e.g., Goltsov et al. (2012), and propose mechanisms of
combination therapy action to explain why, in a model of drugs binding to signalling
network nodes, two drugs that are applied individually are ineffective yet when
applied in combination and at the same time are effective in overcoming drug
resistance (Kholodenko 2015). Thus models can contribute to rational drug design
and in doing so help us understand signalling pathway complexities.
This opportunity is, however, impeded by the computational–biological discipline
divide. Biologists and clinicians readily understand simple models, but simple models
cannot deliver value in the face of the complexities noted above. Models that represent
sufﬁcient complexity to help us understand a signalling network can be challenging for
biologists to ﬁrst formulate and then interpret (Janes and Lauffenburger 2013). Janes
and Lauffenburger (2013) provide a review of the value of such signalling network
models for experimental cell biology. They highlight that key barriers are confusion
over the purpose of the model, predictions from the model, and the wide range of
modelling approaches available. The purpose should be to—try to—explain speciﬁc
phenomena observed in experimentation; predictions made are often in the context of
assumptions especially relating to gaps in knowledge of parameter values; the selected
approach needs to take account of the purpose and the available knowledge. Indeed,
our own work on CoSMoS (Stepney et al. 2011) provides a framework to address
exactly these barriers.
Going beyond this computational–biological discipline divide, the complexities
in signalling networks run deeper than topology. Nodes, and combinations of nodes,
in the network serve as switches, integrators and inhibitors, and the speciﬁc function
of any given node or sub-network can be variable, contextualised by its inputs in a
non-linear manner. Thus, non-linear components operate with variable function in
complex networks. It then becomes impossible to describe system behaviour in
linear and simple narrative. In fact, it has been suggested that rather than a node-
centric view, it is likely that the dynamic features of the network itself might form the
basis of drug targets (Behar et al. 2013).

Towards Narratives for Anti-Cancer Drug Design
We have so far established the following:
•
Cancer is a complex system driven in part by aberrant cellular function;
18
Narratives for Drug Design
261

•
Signalling networks are a useful level of detail at which to study cellular function,
and are themselves complex;
•
Parts of those signalling networks can be targeted by anti-cancer drug therapies to
seek to restore aberrant functioning;
•
The signalling network is dynamic in its reaction to drugs and mutations, and its
structure can change over time;
•
Computational models can support our understanding of cell responses to drug
action, including the various mechanisms of drug resistance;
•
Computational models that are of sufﬁcient detail to represent mechanisms of
resistance can be prohibitively complex for biologists.
Here, we describe brieﬂy an interactive visualisation technology that could
provide the foundations for narratives. The use of data storytelling to communicate
and stimulate insights is a growing research area (Bach et al. 2016). Segel and Heer
(2010) provide a systematic review of work seeking to combine narrative and
interactive visualisations, and note that while sophisticated visualisation tools
might provide powerful vehicles for discovering stories, narrative communication
depends on more than visualisation.
Boy et al. (2015) distinguish between two types of information visualisations:
explanatory and exploratory. Explanatory information visualisations are common in
journalistic contexts, are typically used to support the narrative presented in the text,
and have limited interactivity. Segel and Heer (2010) categorise such explanatory
information visualisations as author-driven. In contrast, exploratory information
visualisations require a reader-driven approach with free interactivity (Boy et al.
2015), and are motivated by provoking discoveries in the patterns of data.
We propose that our technology is a vehicle to support reader-driven narratives,
but is not in of itself a narrative. This technology, SiViT (Bown et al. 2017), turns a
complex model into an interactive animation, allowing the cancer specialist intuitive
access to complex systems models otherwise inaccessible. SiViT is able to represent
graphically the network structure of models of cell signalling, such as that described
in Fig. 18.1. The models encapsulate a system of differential equations and SiViT
computes these equations and animates a simulation of the model of the system
dynamics. Thus SiViT provides a ‘movie’ of the simulation, showing the whole
system behaviour. Moreover, each node in the network can be queried and a pop-up
graph of node activity over time presented.
This is a useful contribution in respect of validation: all models depend on a set of
assumptions and these assumptions can be difﬁcult to elicit, especially in the case of
complex systems models. Modelling frameworks such as CoSMoS (Bown et al.
2012) have found ways of explicating and then challenging the assumption set
underpinning a complex systems model and its simulation. SiViT provides a com-
plementary explication: simulation dynamics are animated in the hope that major
departures in the model (or indeed simulation) formulation are identiﬁed.
Crucially, SiViT also allows the user to add in and then visualise the effects of
cancer-causing mutations and anti-cancer drugs. Mutations associated with drug
resistance can be introduced by changing simulation parameters through another
262
J. Bown and A. Goltsov

drop down menu. Drugs can be added in through a drop-down menu, at a prescribed
dosage at a particular time. Combinations of drugs can be added to explore the
effects of different doses and of dose sequencing. These combinations can be drawn
from a known set of drugs. Alternatively, new drugs can be designed by changing
simulation parameters directly to simulate the effect of that designed drug.
Any simulation conﬁguration, in terms of drugs and mutations, can be compared
with another (one) simulation conﬁguration. In pairwise comparisons, the two
conﬁgurations are deﬁned as Control and Experiment and the visualisation is a
mix of red, blue and white. The colour of each node and edge component is set by
whether the value of the Control component is greater than, less than or equal to the
value of the corresponding component in the Experiment, with colour intensity
proportional to this difference. Figure 18.3 shows a signalling network visualisation
using SiViT.
Figure 18.4 shows a typical set of SiViT visualisations. The network is that of the
PI3K/PTEN/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways shown in Fig. 18.1 (except for
the sub-network of Fig. 18.1 below the ERK—pERK—ppERK interactions).
Figure 18.4a, b show the effect of an anti-cancer drug after 1 min and 10 min
respectively. Figure 18.4a shows an immediate and substantial down-regulation of
signalling since most of the network is blue. By 10 minutes, we observe differences
in pathway dynamics: in Fig. 18.4b the lower pathway is still down-regulated and the
upper pathway has similar levels of signalling to the network without the drug, i.e.,
the Control condition, since much of this pathway is white. Thus, the overall
signalling activity in this upper pathway is the same but signalling dynamics are

slowed by the drug action—a different dynamic to that of the lower pathway. Areas
in red show non-local, emergent phenomena: red areas represent accumulations of
species concentrations as a result of drug action inhibiting nodes elsewhere in the
pathway network.
Figure 18.4c shows a network with a cancer-causing mutation introduced at a
single point. This single point mutation has a marked effect on the whole network
functioning, where at the end of the 10-min time-course the inhibitor has a far
weaker effect in reducing signalling. Figure 18.4d depicts the state of the network
after the use of combination therapy to restore network sensitivity to the drug. The
resistant network with combination therapy shown in Fig. 18.4d is very similar to the
sensitive (normal) network with single therapy in Fig. 18.4b in respect of the overall
pattern of signalling.
Note, the white insets show key biological indicators of signalling activity in the
Control (black line) and Experiment (blue line) simulation conditions. In Figs. 18.4a,
c and d the insets show AKT levels—a key regulator of cell survival, growth and
proliferation. The intended drug action is to reduce the amount of active AKT in the
network. In Fig. 18.4a levels of inactive AKT are increased following drug action as
expected; in the resistant network of Fig. 18.4c inactive AKT is decreased. In
Fig. 18.4d, SiViT was used to determine the minimum dose to match the key
biological indicator (AKT) as shown in the overlapping blue and black lines of the
pop-up inset.
Beyond this representation, the observer is currently left to construct an interpre-
tation of the system dynamics by integrating the observed individual components;
the task is of course easier than such inference from the equation set or graph-based
time-series readouts. Additional layers of abstraction and perspectives could add to
the explanatory power of simulation results.
5
Conclusion
SiViT can reveal system dynamics in a literal sense. A key limitation of many
information visualisation systems identiﬁed by (Lee et al. 2015) is that there is no
provision for the “making of a story”. Where visualisations cue key events in the
system dynamics, or story pieces, it is down to the user to extract and organise
meaningfully those story pieces without support from the visualisation system (Lee
et al. 2015). Additionally, visualisations are not typically designed to highlight key
events, including system changes in functioning and—here—the invocation of
compensatory mechanisms of feedback.

For signalling networks, in the light of increasing understanding of the limitations
of drug design targeting single nodes in the face of topological changes in signalling
network architecture, Behar et al. (2013) propose that signalling hub topology, and
crucially the response of that topology to differing signalling pathway inputs, i.e.,
drugs, has utility in advancing anti-cancer therapy. In Behar et al. (2013) the network
is viewed in terms of sub-networks that provide dynamical mapping of inputs to
outputs; interventions (drugs) are viewed in terms of their impact on that mapping.
They combine this concept with that of a network motif (Wong et al. 2012), where a
motif is a particular conﬁguration of nodes in a sub-network that is observed
regularly and pervasively in a range of biological systems. Motifs include switches,
feedback loops, feed-forward loops and integrators. Behar et al. (2013) suggest that
signalling networks either exhibit these motifs explicitly or may be abstracted into
such a motif based on the observed dynamics of that sub-network. In taking this view
the network, or at least sub-networks, in addition to the pathway nodes, has agency.
Moreover, motifs and changes in network or sub-network topology may well
represent key story pieces.
Thus any interactive, visual account of cell signalling in response to drugs needs
to reveal both node and sub-network dynamics, in an integrated and concurrent
manner. System-scale dynamics must be portrayed such that conformational changes
in sub-networks, such as from e.g., a feedback into a feed-forward loop, are depicted
concurrently with up- and down-regulation of nodes, and importantly how the two
are connected. This interconnection is likely to be non-linear and context-sensitive:
we must explore the use of concurrent accounts of signalling at different spatial and
temporal scales to reveal this link, with key events in each account being cross-
linked to reveal how one impacts the other.
This dynamic representation of signalling network dynamics requires communi-
cation via video, although highlighting important events is not readily translated into
a narrative form. New work by Bach et al. (2016) provides a thought-provoking ﬁrst
study on the use of the well-established and visually rich medium of comics to tell
stories about dynamic networks. Bach et al. (2016) note that comics are already used
to convey information beyond entertainment in order to inform and educate in an
engaging way. They founded their notational design on good practice in the existing
domain of graphic comics and tested the effectiveness of designed comics to convey
network changes over time. The results conﬁrmed that with minimal textual cueing
the intended dynamics were successfully conveyed.
While the comics used in this study are not as complex as required to represent
signalling network dynamics, we believe that this work, combined with our own
interactive and executable visualisation technology, provides a ﬁrst hint towards the
narrating of cellular signalling networks. In principle, and with some user direction,
key switches in behaviour driven by drug action and mutation identiﬁed via SiViT
could be pushed out to a comic format with panels showing key states and alternate
pathways in time. The comic would then architect the key story pieces, and events
leading to marked changes in signalling network functioning, into a narrative
underpinned by the more detailed SiViT visualisation. This would both aid
266

understanding of signalling network dynamics and, crucially, improve reporting in
linear reporting media, in particular, in scientiﬁc journals.

Time Will Tell: Narrative Expressions
of Time in a Complex World
Leo Caves, Ana Teixeira de Melo, Susan Stepney, and Emma Uprichard
Abstract Time is intrinsic to all complex systems. Here we explore the complexity
of time from three different disciplinary perspectives: the physical, the biological
and the social. We do this by listing some expressions of time taken from everyday
speech and idioms and relating them to complex temporal concepts that are central to
these different disciplines. The result is a series of small sections that together weave
a particular interdisciplinary (hi)story of time in complexity.
Quid est ergo tempus? Si nemo ex me quaerat, scio; si quaerenti explicare velim, nescio.
(What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who
asks, I do not know.)
(Saint Augustine, Confessions, c.397)
The truth, even more, is that life is perpetually weaving fresh threads which link one
individual and one event to another, and that these threads are crossed and recrossed,
doubled and redoubled to thicken the web, so that between any slightest point of our past
and all the others a rich network of memories gives us an almost inﬁnite variety of
communicating paths to choose from.
(Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time, 1927)

“Once Upon a Time . . .”
We begin this chapter on time and complexity here; it could start at any number of
different places. But if there are beginnings and births in complex systems, then they
emerge over time, even though they are also erased through time too.
2
“Time Is a Great Story Teller”
Time is a central feature of complex systems. We are complex, and our world is
complex. Everything is changing; all is process. Time is change, and change is about
time. Time is here and it is there. We need to know how to talk about it, how to
narrate it, so that we can deal with it.
3
“Winding Up”
Features of the complex world are embedded in our daily lives and will ﬁnd
expression in our narratives. Here we look at everyday expressions regarding time.
We then look at these from three different disciplinary perspectives: physical,
biological and social. We make no attempt to provide a comprehensive coverage
of the issues relating to time within each discipline. Instead we look to bring out
different disciplinary ﬂavours of the conception of time in relation to complex
systems. By providing different perspectives and by placing them together, we
hope to throw into relief the differences in how time is viewed in different disci-
plines, and to explore the complementarity of these views, to see if they can provide
a broader and richer view of complex systems.
The questions we address are: What can we learn from our narrative expressions
of time? What do these expressions reveal about being complex and living in a
complex world? How is time expressed and recognised within different disciplinary
domains of complex systems research? What do the different disciplinary perspec-
tives offer, as resources, to build a richer narrative of time?
I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths.
(Jorge Luis Borges, “The Garden of Forking Paths,” 1941)

“It’s All a Matter of Time”
We respond to our questions by listing some expressions of time taken from everyday
speech and idioms, commonly known proverbs and sayings. We relate these idioms
to temporal concepts in different disciplines with a particular focus on complex
systems. The result is a series of small sections that together weave a particular
interdisciplinary (hi)story of time in complexity. The story of time we present moves
270
L. Caves et al.

from the more physical notions of time, to the biological, through to more social
temporal aspects. This way of delineating the physical, biological and social is
artiﬁcial: they are all intertwined. Yet to explore the multiple ways that time is
intrinsic to complexity, we tell the story of time and complexity in a way that both
maintains some fuzzy boundaries between the physical, biological and social, and
disrupts them by showing how the multiple aspects of time and temporality leak
through all aspects of change. In doing so, we develop a distinctive narrative of time
whilst reﬂexively illustrating that time shapes complex patterns of being and becom-
ing more generally. As Lakoff and Johnson (1994) argue, metaphors shape the way
we think, what we do, and how we experience the world. They also note (p. 131) that
“new metaphors have the power to create a new reality”. It is in this temporal spirit
that we shape our chapter.
Time present and time past,
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
(T. S. Eliot, “Burnt Norton,” Four Quartets, 1936)
5
“Working Like Clockwork”
The physics of time has a punctuated history. It starts rather simplistically with
Newton, who chiselled time into the bedrock of physical law and set in motion the
clockwork universe of Laplace. Newton argued for an absolute time, divorced from
the things existing within it. “Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and
from its own nature, ﬂows equably without relation to anything external” (Newton
1999). There is some natural underlying ‘clock’, ticking away regularly, independent
of anything else. The Newtonian worldview is complete: the universe is out there,
time is absolute, causality is straightforward; the future is predictable. If we know the
system’s precise location in its state-space (that is, the positions and velocities of all
its particles) and the forces acting, then we can predict its future states. Newtonian
physics1 has laws that are deterministic and time-reversible, and so we can equally
well retrodict, and even recreate, the past: take any given state of the system, reverse
the direction of time (by reversing the direction of the velocities) and you can go
back to past events. The clockwork can run backwards just as well as forwards. This,
however, as we discuss below, is counter to our everyday experience of irreversible
processes, ones that are not symmetric in time.
A clock is a little machine that shuts us out from the wonder of time.
(Susan Glaspell and George Cram Cook, Tickless Time)
1As do quantum mechanics (at least up to the point of wavefunction collapse, or many-worlds
splitting, or decoherence, or whatever interpretation you prefer) and relativity.

“It’s Just One Thing After Another”
In contrast to the Newtonian view of absolute time, the relational view of time is that
it marks the order in which events occur: time is an order of successions (Leibnitz
1717). Time marks the order in which things happen, in which things change.
Barbour (2001) states “time is nothing but change”. Time does not, and cannot,
pass if nothing changes. If something keeps changing, then that gives the means to
measure time, and even the deﬁnition of time itself. This view of the arbitrariness of
time, being merely a relational order, rather than a pre-determined ticking clock,
gives us freedom to choose how we mark off the passing moments in the way that is
most convenient.
Time is deﬁned so that motion looks simple.
(Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, Gravitation, 1973)
7
“Time Is Relative”
Einstein’s theories of relativity also have deterministic and time-reversible equations.
In contrast to Newton’s clockwork time, special relativity merges space and time into
spacetime (Minkowski 1918). Three-dimensional space and one-dimensional time
are uniﬁed into a four-dimensional spacetime, where they are, to some degree,
interchangeable. In particular, events that are remote in space that look simultaneous
in time to one observer may appear to occur in different orders to other observers.
General relativity allows gravitational distortions to this spacetime (Einstein 1920).
So relativity brings a new view of time that is dependent on the frame of reference of
the observer: time is not absolute, but relative. Relativity ushers in a strange world
that has captured our imaginations: time dilation, black holes, event horizons.
Scientiﬁc people [...] know very well that Time is only a kind of Space.
(H.G. Wells, The Time Machine, 1895)
Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows,
and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.
(H. Minkowski, “Space and Time,” 1918)
8
“There’s No Time”/“If We Only Had Time”
In special relativity, (space)time seems to be sitting there largely as a given quantity,
not amenable or subject to explanation. Barbour (2001) takes this further, and moves
from the idea of a system’s trajectory through its state-space to a timeless worldline
in state-spacetime. He argues that fundamental physics involves developing a model
of the Universe that is devoid of time. The focus becomes one of instantaneous
interactions (or conﬁgurations) that are called “Nows”.
272
L. Caves et al.

Elsewhere2 Barbour notes, “I suggest that our belief in time and a past arises
solely because our entire experience comes to us through the medium of static
arrangements of matter, in Nows, that create the appearance of time and change”
and “I merely want to suggest that the appearance of time arises exclusively from
very special matter conﬁgurations which we ﬁnd can be interpreted as mutually
consistent records of processes that unfolded in a past in accordance with deﬁnite
physical laws that involve time.” Such a radical description of a static universe has
profound implications for the way that we view the world and for the understanding
of our own cognitive processes and places Time right back in the box.
The universe is true for us all and dissimilar to each of us.
(Marcel Proust, In Search of Lost Time, 1927)
9
“You Never Know What Will Happen”
Despite various timeless formulations, the majority of authors agree on the existence
of time (Smolin 2013), if not agreeing on what it is.
One particular way of observing time through systems and understanding systems
through time is dynamical systems theory (Strogatz 2014). Dynamical systems
theory is a deterministic theory: given the same initial conditions, the same dynamics
will unfold. There is no randomness: Laplace’s demon can perfectly predict the
future from the current state of the world. Even chaotic systems are deterministic.
They are however unpredictable in all but the short term, as we can never measure
the state of the world precisely enough to predict it far into the future.
In contrast, quantum systems have an intrinsic non-deterministic component. Instead
of a point moving through state space, they are formulated in terms of a wave function,
capturing a probability distribution, evolving deterministically through time. When
observed, the wave function “collapses”3 to a speciﬁc, but non-deterministic, value.
It is very difﬁcult to predict – especially the future.
(Niels Bohr, attrib.4)
10
“There’s No Going Back”
Dropping a glass, it falling and smashing; the transfer of the heat from boiling water to
a cooler mug; the diffusion of a perfume across a room; these are all natural experi-
ences. All of these processes have an accepted and predictable direction in time. The
reverse processes are, in principle, possible, but are very highly improbable: you won’t
observe them, unless you expend considerable work in effecting the reversal.

What provides this directionality, this “arrow” of time? The Second Law of
Thermodynamics is one of the few physical laws with a temporal direction: it states
that the entropy, or disorder, of a system increases with time.5 It is an emergent
property of the underlying time-symmetric laws of motion governing the micro-
scopic states of the system. For things to happen spontaneously there must be an
increase in disorder in the universe (which, if extrapolated, inexorably leads to the
heat-death of the universe).
Even if one is happy with emergent time-asymmetry, this does not solve all the
puzzles of time. The current state of the universe is high entropy relative to the initial
state, at the Big Bang, of low entropy, which is a highly unlikely state. Why was the
initial state such low entropy? Additionally, many (but not all) cosmological models
have the Big Bang as the origin of time itself: there was no “before”.
An arrow of time was hypothesised early in evolutionary biology by Dollo in his
Principle of Irreversibility: “An organism is unable to return, even partially, to a
previous stage already realized in its ancestral series” (Dollo 1893). Modern inter-
pretations use the same sort of probabilistic arguments that underpin the Second Law
of Thermodynamics concerning the statistical improbability of systems (organisms)
following exactly the same evolutionary trajectory (either forward or reverse)
(Dawkins 1986). However, there is increasing evidence that organisms can revert
to features thought lost in deep evolutionary time (Wiens 2011). This underpins how
the organisation of biological systems, as complex adaptive systems, cannot be
thought of as collections of independent particles. They are highly relational entities,
whose structure can hold their history, and this history can be revisited.
Nothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.

“It’s a Waste of Time”/“Time Stands Still”
Systems where all energy and matter have reached a static distribution and there is no
further increase in entropy are in equilibrium. Equilibrium is the “natural” state of
(isolated) matter. The state of matter “runs downhill” to reach equilibrium, where it
is at rest, static, unchanging. The system may be perturbed away from equilibrium,
but it will return to equilibrium once the perturbation is removed.
Complex systems dynamically exchange energy and increase order (at least
locally), so they are non-equilibrium systems. Prigogine developed non-equilibrium

L. Caves et al.

thermodynamics (Prigogine and Stengers 1985) and found a key new organising
principle, the dissipative structure: a dynamic ﬂow (ﬂux) of energy or matter which
maintains a stable form, such as a vortex. This provides a new physical view that
supports and complements studies of complex adaptive systems. Dissipative struc-
tures allow us to make sense of how order can develop and be maintained within
apparent chaos.
Systems far-from-equilibrium might appear static and unchanging, but such a
system is actively maintaining itself in this non-equilibrium homeostatic state; it is
constantly “walking up a down escalator”. This takes expenditure of inﬂowing
energy and produces entropy: waste. This apparent static nature can lead to a false
sense of lack of change; a change then to inﬂows or outﬂows can have a surprisingly
large effect. Restoring the inﬂows and outﬂows to their previous values may not
necessarily return the system to its previous homeostatic state: a manifestation of
hysteresis.
In Biology, evolution takes place over time. However, the notion of stasis draws
attention to the fact that there can be periods where there is little evidence of change
(Eldredge et al. 2005). A system’s own timescale can often be deﬁned by the period
that it appears static. On longer timescales it will change: grow, develop, reproduce,
die; its apparent “balance” is on a particular timescale only.
Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.

“Any Path Will Take You There”
Although complex systems are always changing, they do so in particular ways. State
space6 is a fundamental concept here, as is the related notion of attractors. State
space is an abstract mathematical space of many dimensions. Consider a system of
many particles existing in real space and moving with time. Combine all their
positions and velocities into a single point in a multi-dimensional state space. The
movement of this point in the state space, its trajectory, describes the dynamics of
the entire system (Strogatz 2014).
In some systems, the long term history of a trajectory is conﬁned to a small region
of the state space: the attractor of the trajectory. Some attractors are point, or simple
orbits, indicating a stable history. Other strange attractors exhibit a complex fractal
structure, indicating a chaotic history, including properties such as sensitive

dependence on initial conditions (Lorenz 1963). The trajectory may have some
initial transient behaviour before it is conﬁned within the attractor. Systems contin-
ually perturbed by environmental inputs may never reach an attractor, but be
perpetually transient.
When all's said and done, all roads lead to the same end. So it's not so much which road you
take, as how you take it.

“Ups and Downs; Fast and Slow”
Living systems tend to be organised in hierarchies (Miller 1978). Lower levels (such
as molecules, cells) can be maintained and enhanced through the emergence of higher
order structures (such as tissues, organs). The system (e.g., organism) operates as a
whole, with properties that emerge from the lower level subsystems, but which can in
turn inﬂuence lower level behaviour (through downward causation). Such systems
are not just structural hierarchies, but exhibit exquisite orchestration of events across
a wide spectrum of timescales (Noble 2008).
A timescale might be said to be a measure of time that naturally encompasses a
particular change. It forms a natural unit with which to measure the rate of that
change. For example, a day, a week, a season, a year, an electoral cycle, a generation,
a lifetime; social, historical, archaeological, evolutionary, geological, astronomical
timescales.
A complex system necessarily has multiple timescales: at least the local time-
scales of the component parts, and the global timescale of the whole system. The
latter is typically larger than the former. For example, the millisecond timescale of
bacterial chemotaxis emerges from molecular motions on the one millionth of a
billionth of a second timescale. Likewise, a country’s historical change emerges
from, and tends to be slower than, that of its neighbourhoods. But complex systems
do not exist one within another; there will be several interacting systems nested
within a higher-level system. Thus, there are several cities in a country; each city has
its own particular timescale of change, and they change in interdependent ways, even
if they change in antagonistic ways and in different ways.
When timescales of levels are well separated, the levels below move so fast that
their motion “blurs”, and the components can be treated as a relatively homogeneous
blurred substrate. Contrariwise, the levels above are so slow they can often be treated
as essentially static. When timescales are not so well separated, or when a system is
examined over large multiples of its own timescale, such approximations are no
longer valid, and ﬂuctuations in the faster system, and changes in the slower system,
become important. Extrapolations that assume a static upper (or lower) level can be
badly wrong.
Additionally, in heterogeneous systems, different components at ostensibly the
same “level” might have very different timescales. For example, the evolutionary
276
L. Caves et al.

timescale of viruses is similar to the individual adaptation timescale (rather than the
species evolutionary timescale) of people (Zanini et al. 2015).
People in a system will tend to privilege their own timescales of experience: from
about a second to about a generation. Even then, children and old people have
different perceptions of time. Timescales faster and slower than these are essentially
imperceptible to people, except intellectually, or by use of technology such as slow
motion and time-lapse photography. Such technologies can radically alter human
perception of things by viewing them at different timescales; for example, clouds
viewed through time lapse photography can change in conception from relatively
static objects to highly dynamic processes. Furthermore, the introduction of tech-
nology can change the timescale of part of the system (for example, automating a
previously manual process), which can cause issues (for example, a trading “ﬂash
crash”) if other interacting components are still working at their previous timescales.
Time goes through multiple times.

14
“Deep Time”
Complex systems can have multiple timescales, which suggests the need for multiple
narratives, or at least nested narratives. How can a narrative span multiple time-
scales, including ones beyond natural human comprehension?
Histories clearly can encompass multi-generational timescales. There are several
science ﬁction stories that attempt to encompass deep time by having “human scale”
vignettes scattered along a vast timescale: Wells’ The Time Machine, Stapledon’s
Last and First Men, Shefﬁeld’s Tomorrow and Tomorrow, and more. Yet even these
tend to have only the two timescales: the human one, and a massively longer one.

“Everything That Goes Around Comes Around”/“The
More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same”
When patterns of change in a system persist over time in the midst of many dynamic
processes, this is the signature of the coupling processes, of feedback. Feedback is
the mechanism that affords control of a system whereby a change in level of a stock7
7“Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time”
(Meadows 2008, p. 17).
19
Time Will Tell: Narrative Expressions of Time in a Complex World
277

affects the rate of that stock’s input or output processes. As Meadows puts it: “A
feedback loop is a closed chain of causal connections from a stock, through a set of
decisions or rules or physical laws or actions that are dependent on the level of the
stock, and back again through a ﬂow to change the stock” (2008, p. 27). Complex
systems emerge from and consist of feedback. As Jay Forrester8 notes:
Systems of information-feedback control are fundamental to all life and human endeavor,
from the slow pace of biological evolution to the launching of the latest space satellite ...
Everything we do as individuals, as an industry, or as a society is done in the context of an
information-feedback system. (Forrester 1961, p. 15)
You can drive a system crazy by muddying its information streams.
(Donella H. Meadows, Thinking in Systems, 2008)
16
“It’s a Vicious/Virtuous Cycle”
Feedbacks can be balancing (negative feedback) and serve to keep stocks stable
(with a given range). This is useful in maintaining the buffering effect of stocks,
allowing more freedom in the operation of system processes. Feedbacks can also be
reinforcing (positive feedback), serving to amplify the rate of change of stocks
(either increasing or decreasing) (Maruyama 1963). Feedback can lead to vicious
or virtuous cycles. These can be useful when you need sub-systems to grow, or
replicate, or die, but if not carefully controlled they can lead to system-level
instability, or destruction.
We are not going in circles, we are going upwards.
The path is a spiral; we have already climbed many steps.
(Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha, 1922)
17
“Which Came First, the Chicken or the Egg?”
We live in a world of interlocked loops of causality, since most complex systems
have multiple feedback loops. Here the things of interest being described in such
systems are not instantaneous events, but temporally extended objects and processes.
D affects E, which in turn affects D, which then affects E, contrary to a simplistic
linear causal description. It might not make sense to ask if D causes E or vice versa:
they mutually cause each other through feedback. Downward causation (Campbell
1974) is where a high level emergent property affects the low level components
comprising it, for example in the case of Darwinian evolution (Ellis 2012); it can be
thought of as a form of feedback causation across emergent levels.

L. Caves et al.

We, as organisms, are constructed from the material of the environment through
myriad coupled processes that serve to orchestrate the production. We make our-
selves, and continually remake ourselves, as we develop, maintain and ultimately
decay. We exist as recurring sets of patterns of material organisation that are self-
making and self-reproducing: autopoietic systems (Varela et al. 1974).
We are deeply coupled with the world around us: the environment we live in, with
its intrinsic dynamics, affects our own dynamics; equally, we affect the environment
and can change its dynamics (as we are becoming increasingly aware). A natural
consequence of this deep systemic view is that we and our environment are part of
one holistic system: a dependent co-arising (Macy 1991).
This deep coupling, the feedback loops, the downward causation, the continual
remaking, this “loopiness” of time, can lead to a feeling of loss of the time
dimension: there is no trivial linearisation that captures these properties of complex
systems. We wonder if this may be a factor in why complex systems cannot be
(trivially) narrated.

18
“It Will All Come Together in the End”/“It’s Not Where
You Start, It’s Where You Finish”
A key feature of complex systems is that they contain multiple, dynamic interactions
and seemingly offer a large number of ways to change. There are myriad potential
states that they could visit. However, many complex systems exhibit equiﬁnality: the
phenomenon that some systems, despite (and because of) their complexity, are able
to consistently move towards well deﬁned (recognisable) end states. The classic
example is biological development: where the genetic regulation required for com-
plex developmental processes is under strong feedback-driven control, and this can
keep the developmental trajectory on course to its next (or end) state.
While equiﬁnality assumes that there are many pathways to the same outcome,
the multiﬁnality principle states that essentially the same initial conditions can end up
in very different outcomes, for example, due to the butterﬂy effect.

“Things Get Worse Before They Get Better”
In complex systems, change is often non-linear and transitions occur in periods of
instability, of turbulence and through critical ﬂuctuations (Haken et al. 1985). The
parameters or variables that inﬂuence or drive a system through different states may
reach critical values and become unstable before the whole system can reorganize
into a new state (Bak et al. 1987; Haken 1977). Disorder, then, tends to precede (new
kinds of) order. It is said that for some systems the more adaptive regimes are near
the edge of chaos9 where there is sufﬁcient diversity, complexity and instability for
novelty to emerge through ﬂuctuations, but also sufﬁcient stability for some things to
stay the same so we still recognise a given system as the same, even though
transformed. Systems poised in critical states are thought to maximise their oppor-
tunities for change, bringing in the powerful concept of the adjacent possible
(Kaufmann 2000).
Biology provides interesting examples of systems harnessing disorder as staging
posts towards increasing complexity. In metamorphosis, developing organisms can
completely change their body plan in “catastrophic” changes, such as the disinte-
gration, digestion and reabsorption of their body in prior developmental stages
(Ryan 2011). Evolution towards criticality is now associated with the emergence
of collective behaviour in biological systems (Hidalgo et al. 2014), suggesting that it
is an effective way of surviving in our uncertain world.
History presents many examples of how periods of instability and crises were
critical for the emergence of new social orders. The progression of revolutions has
been likened to a “fever” associated with different symptoms such as the breakdown
of government control, the emergence of radicals, etc. (Brinton 1953). Brinton
claims that revolution "in itself is a good thing ... for the organism that survives it
... The revolution destroys wicked people and harmful and useless institutions". The
notion of revolution is closely associated with creativity and technology, as in
disruptive innovation (Christensen 1997).
There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.
(Vladimir Lenin, in Friedman, 2014)

“It Depends How You Look at It”/“Give It Time”/
“Things Might Look Different in Time”
How time is known and experienced individually and collectively is always and
necessarily a messy mixture of (at least) three different domains of time: physical,
biological and social. Whilst physical and biological aspects of time are necessarily
part of human existence and are therefore relevant to social time, so much of how the
social world is shaped and experienced is driven by socially constructed notions of
time. Age, for example, is real in its inevitable ‘arrow’ of increased years, but the
extent to which ‘childhood’ and ‘adulthood’ are experienced as such is dependent on
the ways that these age-related phenomena are constructed socially and historically.
For example, Monday is but a moment in time, but the naming of this moment as
‘Monday’ gives it meaning and order which are inherently social concepts,
constructed to help social order. Thus, even if we accept that ‘that Friday feeling’
has more to do with the social meaning of the end of the work week and the beginning
of the weekend and less to do with physical or biological time, the fact that ‘that
Friday feeling’ is experienced as real means that it is a social time that is worth
exploring, since it is likely to impact on the way that everyday social life unfolds. The
fact that ‘that Friday feeling’ may be experienced differently by a 20-year-old
compared to a 70-year-old doesn’t make Friday less real; on the contrary, it suggests
that the social meaning and experience of ‘that Friday feeling’ is also shaped by the
biological necessity of ageing and its impact on how we understand, live and exist in
and with time all the time.
In the mix is the fascinating work on differences in time perception in human
cognition (Grondin 2008). Factors such as emotional state, age, drugs, and disease
can radically alter perceptions of time and tempo. Relationships can lead to
interlocking and distortion of time perception in individuals. It is intriguing to
wonder about larger-scale, community and societal, manifestations. Thus, a key
challenge for our connected world is to gain a better understanding of the temporal
coupling of our interlocking ecological, economic, social and health systems and of
our perception of their timescales.
Time is the wisest of all things that are; for it brings everything to light.
(Thales, in Barker, 2001)

“Time Goes, Death Comes”
Decay, death and dying are intrinsic to all complex systems. If systems do not adapt,
then they will die. Death is, in many ways, the ultimate state change, the ﬁnal
attractor. If there is nothing more to become, then it already became. The ﬁnality of
death and dying is but another necessary rhythm of all complex systems.

“Winding Down”/“Looking Back in Time”
We have explored everyday expressions reﬂecting our embodied experience of time
in the complex world, and used three lenses to understand what complex processes
could be implicated or have a correspondence in the physical, biological and the
social worlds.
We leave the reader with the following questions: How could narratives, as ways
of not just representing and describing but of constructing the world, teach us about
its complexity and its possibilities? Can we capture the necessary multiple perspec-
tives on complex systems through multiple complex narratives? Does the essential
“loopy” feedback nature of complex systems resist narrative? Are there other ways
that narratives could assist science as tools or means for eliciting the kind of surprise
and questioning that calls for abducting reasoning, nurturing and supporting a
pathway of discovery and novel scientiﬁc exploration? Could the practice of living
and enacting our world through narrative means create the playground of rehearsal
and exploration that supports the kind of creativity that comes from playing and
stretching the boundaries of our current constructions? Could new movements of
research unfold through narrating the complex living world as experienced and
enacted by our complex humanity?
Only time could tell. And that, it seemed, it disdained to do.

and Science Fiction, July 1972)

“All Happy Endings Are Beginnings as Well”
So, we end our beginning: a brief look at time, which we hope may catalyse some
reﬂections and projections, in recurrent reveries, encapsulated in the recognition of
this moment and its adjacent possible.
Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end.
But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.

Abstract Richard Walsh, Leo Caves, Ana Teixeira de Melo, Susan Stepney, and

RW:
There’s a lot of food for thought in this draft chapter, and I think in
general it does a great job of expounding a lot of difﬁcult ideas. At the
moment it suffers from its raw status as a combination of three drafts; I
like the structural progression from the physical to the biological to the
social, but the degree of overlap suggests that this might not be the best
top-level organizing principle for the chapter: it might be better pursued
within each of a number of sub-topics.
Authors:
Yes, that was very much a ﬁrst draft, prior to integration. We have taken
those original draft sections, and woven their contents together into a
more ﬁne-grained series of time-related discussions you see here.
RW:
You say that the arrow of time “is an emergent property of the underlying
time-symmetric laws of motion governing the microscopic states of the

system” then “Even if one is happy with emergent time-asymmetry . . .”.
So, the ﬁrst statement is not the matter of fact it appears to be? It seems to
assume a fundamental reciprocal relation between temporality and
systemic processes.
Authors:
Historically the statement caused a huge rumpus in the physics
community, which may have been a factor in Boltzmann’s depression
and suicide. Today it is more accepted, but there is still a struggle to
understand how asymmetry arises from symmetry. Some of the problem
has been pushed back to the Big Bang itself: the universe must have been
in a very low entropy state then, but why?
RW:
And then you say: “The reverse processes are, in principle, possible, but
are very highly improbable: you won’t observe them, unless you expend
considerable work in effecting the reversal.” So the issue is not one of
conceptual asymmetry, but of practical feasibility?
Authors:
This depends on the “level”. At the micro, non-emergent level,
everything is reversible in principle, yes. But it is completely infeasible
in practice, except maybe in certain contrived scenarios. However, at the
time-asymmetric emergent level, where the Second Law holds sway,
there is no access to the individual particles in order to reverse their
courses, so it is not even possible here.
RW:
You say that Newtonian determinism allows us to “retrodict the past”. Is
this actually the case? For example, if you add two numbers together I
can tell you with certainty what the total will be, but I can't tell from the
total which speciﬁc numbers you added.
Authors:
You are quite right: determinism alone is not sufﬁcient for retrodiction.
We have added “and time-reversible laws” to our description. Such laws
mean that the system does not lose information: in your example enough
information would be retained that you could recover the original
numbers. Interestingly, this is a feature of quantum computing: it is
reversible (retains enough information to run backwards) whereas
classical computing is not (it loses information in the manner of your
example). Systems that are deterministic, but lose information are called
dissipative systems. Such systems end up on an attractor, but you cannot
determine what their speciﬁc transient behaviour was before that.
RW:
You say “Relativity ushers in a strange world that has captured our
imaginations: time dilation, black holes, event horizons.” Some
elaboration is needed to bring out the relevance of these concepts.
286
R. Walsh et al.

Authors:
We would love to do this, but unfortunately the section would get too
long and unwieldy. However, we leave in the sentence, to help show
there is even more non-intuitive time lurking in the physics.
RW:
You mention causation due to feedback in one place, and downwards
causation in another. Is downwards causation a case of feedback
causation, or something else?
Authors:
That’s a very nice way of putting it. Feedback causation is typically
thought of as between “peer” processes, A causing B and B causing A
in a sort of feedback leapfrog through time. Downward causation is
between levels: an emergent high level inﬂuencing its lower level
components. This statement can get physicists upset! However,
thinking of it as a form of feedback causation across emergent levels,
involving not instantaneous events, but time-extended processes, helps
remove some of the controversy.
RW:
“People in a system will naturally privilege their own timescales of
experience”: these privileged experiential timescales constitute the
cognitive basis for narrative logic.
Authors:
That’s an interesting link, thank you. This is exactly the kind of insight
we wanted to get from this book project! So, if we are wanting complex
narratives in order to tackle complex systems, we are going to need a
way of handling widely differing, and non-human-level, timescales.
RW:
“We wonder if this may be a factor in why complex systems cannot be
(trivially) narrated.” I think this is right: narration (even self-narration)
adopts an external perspective on its object. The issue here is not just that
of sequence versus loop, but that of perspectivalism. Similarly: “Can we
capture the necessary multiple perspectives on complex systems” raises a
key point of the larger book-level discussion: how to evade the
constraints of perspectivalism. Does having multiple narratives do it?
Authors:
Maybe. Probably not quite, but that’s ok. If we assume that complex
systems are always simultaneously both ‘wholes’ and ‘parts’ and that we
may only capture ‘moments’, then we might also assume that like an
orchestra of orchestras, there are always multiple partial rhythms that
need to be narrated. Multiple narratives are certainly key to narrating
complex systems, but they can only ever be partial.
RW:
“How can a narrative span multiple timescales, including ones beyond
natural human comprehension?” There is a lot of potential and
precedent for messing around with timescales within a narrative, or
between narratives; but does this address the presuppositions of
narrative logic?
Authors:
Perhaps that depends on the narrative logic inscribed within what we
consider to be comprehensive and tangible timescales?

Periodisation
Jason Edwards
Abstract ‘Periodisation’ considers the complex way in which time is experienced
and described, autobiographically, historically, and epochally. It performatively lays
out alongside and on top of each other numerous ways of conceiving time, some of
them overlapping, some of them contradictory, some of them perspectival. Their
relation may be linear, as in certain models of sequential time, and also stratigraph-
ical, to signal a deeper time. As in a complex system, all of the elements are meant to
be inter-related, and held in the mind at once. This particular system, however, is
mortal, entropic, and ends in death Period.

Commentary on Contributions
Richard Walsh and Susan Stepney
Abstract In this chapter we discuss each of the essays presented in Part II of this
volume, under the following headings: (1) overview; (2) complexity; (3) narrative;
(4) narrating complexity.

When Robots Tell Each Other Stories (Winﬁeld, Chap. 4)
1.1
Overview
Winﬁeld has designed a robot control architecture that can anticipate future events
by building and running simulations of possible futures. In his chapter here, he
proposes exploiting and augmenting this architecture to allow these possible futures,
and other invented scenarios, to be interpreted as, and communicated as, stories.
1.2
Complexity
The form of complexity Winﬁeld describes in his chapter is a social, recursive type.
He describes a control architecture that allows a robot to make decisions about its
future actions, and then shows how, with very minor additions, that could become an
architecture for social robot learning through narrative.

The control architecture is recursive, in that it includes a model of the world that
the robot can use to generate and test potential actions. That model includes a model
of the robot itself (so that it can determine how it would act and respond in those
scenarios), and includes models of other robots, so that it could similarly determine
how they might act and respond in a joint scenario.
The model of robot selves might be quite simple, or more complex: I (robot) have
a model of the world that includes myself; my model of myself might therefore
include its own model of my model of the world (depending how complex my
models are). Similarly, my model of the world includes models of other robots; my
models of the other robots might include the fact that they have a model of the world
that includes a model of myself. And so on. We readily get the possibility of a model
being able to include chains of “I know that you know that I know that . . .”
(Fig. 22.1).
Complexity also arises from the suggested narrative process itself, and the way
that impinges on the robot’s internal world model. That model essentially encapsu-
lates the robot’s “beliefs” about the external world, including about itself and others.
The robot can experience things in the world; it can update its internal world model
based on the experience; it can remember the experience for later use; it can generate-
and-test (“imagine”) experiences; it can update its model based on imagined experi-
ences; it can tell real or imagined experiences to others; it can remember real or
imagined tales of others; it can update its model from the real or imagined tales of
others. The task of determining precisely why the robot’s internal world model now
has the particular form it does, why it now believes what it does about the world,
Fig. 22.1 Red’s model of the world includes itself, its environment, and other robots, possibly
including the fact that itself and the others have (potentially different) internal models of the world

given the events and stories it has experienced and produced, could rapidly become
complex.
1.3
Narrative
Let’s assume that these robots can be programmed to make statements based on their
world models: that seems relatively straightforward. Can they be programmed to tell
stories, as opposed to uttering simple strings of declarative statements? What, from
the computational point of view, is the difference in the grammatical and semantic
structure of a story from that of a collection of declarative statements? If the robots
can be so programmed, can they then use their stories as a part of the way they make
sense of their world? If this could be done, or at the very least, experimented with, it
would be an exciting ﬁrst step towards getting computational experimental evidence
in favour of the narrative sensemaking hypothesis about human cognition.

The robots as described would initially be telling very simple stories: “I saw Red
down by the river yesterday. I haven’t seen Red since then.” “Blue pushed Red in the
river yesterday.” But as we have seen, the essential recursive nature of the robot’s
architecture gives the potential for its stories to grow in complexity and sophisti-
cation, as robots imagine (run scenarios of counterfactual worlds containing robots
imaging scenarios), tell stories, retell stories, embellish stories, and so on. What is
compelling about this approach is the way that the robot’s internal world model is
somehow related to the narratives it can tell, and the fact that experimenters would
have access to that internal model. This approach offers the opportunity to correlate
the complexity and structure of the world model with the complexity and structure of
the associated narratives. There is the potential to experiment with a variety of
complex world models to discover the kinds of narratives each produces.

Sense and Wonder (Walsh, Chap. 5)
2.1
Overview
Walsh considers the limitations of narrative representation of complex processes to
constitute a horizon of our ability to make cognitive sense, but notes the way
complexity confronts us with an awareness of kinds of sense, or order, we cannot
grasp. He explores, through the relation between sense and wonder, the possibility
22
Commentary on Contributions
297

that narratives can offer an acquaintance with complexity in a sense beyond the usual
scope of cognition.
2.2
Complexity
The focus here is upon emergent behaviour, and the tension between the respect in
which it is readily graspable in cognitive narrative terms as a systemic phenomenon,
and the respect in which it is evidently the product of interactions within the system
that exceed such a mode of understanding. Deﬁnitions of emergence have sometimes
sought to incorporate this tension as intrinsic to the phenomenon, with odd results;
Walsh suggests that the notion of “surprise,” while clearly unsatisfactory as part of
such a deﬁnition, actually points in a different direction. It foregrounds the observing
subject, and gestures towards a response that exceeds the bounds of cognition
proper, taking on qualities of a more obviously affective character.
The larger questions at stake in this move are, ﬁrstly, that of the empirical status of
emergence, and secondly, that of the nature of empirical knowledge. If emergent
behaviour is constituted as such by its (narrative) intelligibility in different terms
from those that apply to the micro-level systemic interactions, it seems that elements
of regularity or order in the behaviour of a system may exist without being discern-
ible as emergent, in the sense that the regularity of a pattern clearly exists even
though it does not properly become a pattern until recognized as such. The concept
of levels that informs most accounts of emergence is equivocal on this point,
cultivating ambiguity between a view of the level as natural, and a view of it as an
attribute of observation. Deﬁnitions invoking concepts of scale, scope and resolution
reﬁne the language of levels considerably, and make more explicit the inter-
dependence of what belongs to the object and what belongs to the observation.
This seems to be an aspect of a broader conception of empirical knowledge as not of
or about the object in itself, but rather as a relation to the object. The evidently
speciﬁc and circumscribed affordances of cognition itself dictate that knowledge is
relational, and that this is a non-trivial circumstance. The connection between the
particular case of emergence and the general case is apparent when we acknowledge
that the same relational structure has already informed the delimitation of the system
of interest itself.
2.3
Narrative
The implausible invocation of surprise in relation to emergence hints at analogous
questions about our affective responses to narrative (or more speciﬁcally, to the
forms of plot). This allows Walsh to reﬁne the idea of surprise with reference to
suspense, which is the most affectively powerful rhetorical exploitation of an
intrinsic feature of narrative communication, its double relation to knowledge.
298
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

This doubleness recurs in different forms throughout the theorization of narrative, at
different levels of scrutiny; Walsh seizes upon its operation in forms of character
narration and “omniscient” narration, for the sake of the suggestive religious over-
tones of the latter. The doubleness is a constitutive feature of narrative, however,
precisely because narrative is a post-cognitive phenomenon, a product of cognitive
activity. Hence narrative functions in semiotic terms, within the domain of meaning,
whether we are talking about what is immediately present to knowledge in narrative
or what is in principle available—either in retrospect, upon the narrative’s resolution,
or implicitly, via chains of inference. The relation is precisely between two kinds or
degrees of knowledge, rather than between a knowing subject and an object of
knowledge. The cognitive and affective qualities associated with narrative inter-
pretation, then, offer an analogy but not an equivalence with those features of
empirical sensemaking. The “real” of narrative, the “what actually happened,” is
itself conceptualized as already a form of knowledge, just as the religious sensibility
negotiates with the universe by conceiving an absolute form of knowledge, inde-
pendent of human cognition, in the form of divinity.
2.4
Narrating Complexity
This being so, the prospects for narrating complexity seem to be constrained by the
fact that the complexity of narrative can only roughly approximate the ideal of a
narrative of complexity. The way narrative itself elicits our cognitive and affective
engagement can offer relatively little prospect, where complex phenomena are
concerned, of an advance in the explicit communicative power of narrative. But
does it suggest a possible route towards a cultivated practical understanding of
complex processes, a kind of know-how rather than propositional knowledge?
Walsh ends with Walter Benjamin’s storyteller and his opposition between experi-
ence and explanation, to suggest the extent to which the greatest potential of
narrative may lie in its capacity to exceed the explicit, to enact and cultivate a
mode of sensemaking that extends the reach of cognition by resisting the tendency to
isolate and privilege information as the vehicle of knowledge.

A Simple Story of a Complex Mind? (Polvinen, Chap. 7)
3.1
Overview
Polvinen addresses the problems of engaging, from a cognitive humanities perspec-
tive, with the manifestations of neuronal activity as cognitive processes that consti-
tute the “brainmind.” She considers narrative and complex systems perspectives
upon the topic, and poses the twofold question of the extent to which each is able to
connect with the other. She appeals to the potential for theories of enactive cognition
22
Commentary on Contributions
299

to mediate, and examines two narrative presentations of the mind in this light to
suggest the merit of narrative enaction, rather than representation, of its systemic
functioning.
3.2
Complexity
In considering mind as a complex system, Polvinen contrasts computational and
enactive models, arguing the merits of the latter for conceptualizing the emergence
of macro-scale brain activity, and the higher-level manifestations of cognition, from
the micro-scale interactions of neurons; she also champions enactive models for their
emphasis upon embodiment, and hence the dynamic openness of the system to its
sensorimotor environment. However, the case for such an approach to modelling the
mind is of less immediate concern here than the consequent issues it raises for our
ability to conceptualize the relation between the systemic relations among neurons
and the forms of cognition accessible to consciousness.
Two considerations seem particularly important: the concept of agency and that
of enaction. Systemic accounts of cognition inherently decompose the notion of the
conscious subject as agent with which we are familiar. However, Polvinen suggests
that the disconcerting appearance of this conceptual move is largely a result of the
persistence of agential thinking, resulting in the equally unfounded attribution of
agency to systemic elements themselves, or to the systemic brain, as distinct from
“you.” Enaction is important because it offers an alternative to representationalism in
cognition. The latter takes a high-level cognitive concept—representation—and
imposes it top-down upon lower-level processes where its applicability, even its
intelligibility, become increasingly questionable. Theories of enactive cognition, on
the contrary, take a concept with a very elemental role in cognition—behaviour
within an environment—and extend it, bottom-up, from the neuronal micro-level to
the emergence of cognition, abstract reasoning and metacognition.
3.3
Narrative
Agency and action are problematic concepts for the negotiation between narrative
and systemic processes precisely because they are already invested in a narrative way
of thinking. However this is itself indicative of the fundamental role of narrative,
which Polvinen explores in terms of the narrative view of mind itself. The range of
such approaches encompasses, at one limit, the premise that a disposition towards
narrative modes of sensemaking is a characteristic of human cognition, to the
hypothesis, at the other limit, that we are constituted as agents, and as selves, by
such narrative processes. To the extent that narrative is not merely a vehicle for the
representation of mental processes, but itself the form of mental processes, its
capacity to articulate such processes appears to be enhanced, although this privileged
300
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

position still remains at the level of emergent cognitive phenomena rather than their
systemic neural substrate.
A sceptical question is bound to arise in response to the narrative view of mind:
doesn’t it extend the concept of narrative too far? Even in terms of the cognitive
processes accessible to consciousness, much of mental activity seems poorly
described as narrative in any very speciﬁc way; or if the term narrative is deemed to
apply by ﬁat, then it risks losing conceptual deﬁnition to the extent that such a view
ceases to mean anything speciﬁc. On the other hand, the challenge of negotiating with
these dilemmas requires us to interrogate the concept of narrative itself, since it
cannot be accepted as a conceptual primitive under such circumstances. That is, the
explanatory power needed to clarify our ideas about the narrative quality of mind, or
narrative as a mode of cognition, is not to be found in narrative itself so much as in
narrative theory.
3.4
Narrating Complexity
On the basis of some version of the narrative view of mind, and of the enactive model
of cognition, Polvinen suggests, the possibility arises that narrating complexity might
be better understood in performative terms than representational terms. This possi-
bility follows if it is legitimate to say in some particular sense that the mind has a
narrative form which is an emergent characteristic of the enactive, systemic processes
of neural interaction with an environment. That premise makes it seems plausible
that, in the face of narrative texts, an interpretative attention to the process of narrative
signiﬁcation, as opposed to its representational product, might afford some insight
into the analogous mental processes. If there are potential gains from such an
approach, though, it also requires considerable circumspection. Narrative inter-
pretation is a negotiation between the systemic interactions and the emergent narra-
tive form of the semiotic system of narrative representation, and this may correlate in
interesting ways with the emergence of narrative cognition out of systemic neural
processes. But if so, it will have more to do with general properties of systems than the
speciﬁc system of narrative semiotics, since this semiotics is itself an emergent
product of the systemic micro-level of cognition, not the form of that system.

Closure, Observation and Coupling (Lively, Chap. 9)
4.1
Overview
The focus in Lively’s chapter is on the theorization of narrative ﬁction in autopoietic
terms, drawing upon Humberto Maturana’s conception of autopoiesis as the deﬁning
characteristic of self-reproducing systems, and Niklas Luhmann’s appropriation of
22
Commentary on Contributions
301

that concept from the domain of biological systems to that of social and communi-
cative systems.
4.2
Complexity
Lively justiﬁes this extension of the scope of autopoiesis by showing the extent to
which it was already part of the Aristotelian concept of poiesis upon which
Maturana’s theory is based. Indeed, an explicit analogy between biological organ-
isms and works of art runs through the Poetics, suggesting that autopoiesis is best
considered not as an idea about organic life, but more abstractly as an idea about
systems. The three central ideas informing Lively’s discussion of narrative and
autopoiesis—closure, observation, coupling—all work at this level of abstraction.
Closure, here, is dissociated from its common literary-critical meaning in relation
to the resolution of narrative, and considered instead as the foundational formal
move of “operative closure,” by which a system’s internal operations demarcate it
from its environment. The signiﬁcant point is that this elementary move generates an
asymmetry (following George Spencer-Brown’s Laws of Form) and so leads to its
recursive application; this is the engine of autopoiesis.
Observation is a key concept in this context because it subsumes the dual aspects
of perception and communication, which provide the conceptual framework for
understanding the systemic logic of autopoiesis in semiotic terms. The appropriate
model for communication, on this basis, is the joint attentional situation, which
triangulates the reductive model of communication as the transmission of content,
and so makes communicative relations dynamically systemic. The recursive poten-
tial here is realised in a conception of the “art system” as distinctively concerned
with second-order observations of observations.
The notion of coupling is already implicit in this model of the communicative
situation, both in respect of the reciprocity between semiotic articulation and inter-
pretation, and in respect of the coupling of perception and communication. The
mutual constraint between systems that characterizes such structural coupling indi-
cates the possibility of conceptualizing higher levels of systemic reciprocity, and
Lively gestures in this direction by invoking such a view of the history of narrative
ﬁction.
4.3
Narrative
The framework for the speciﬁcally narrative dimension of the chapter is provided by
Mukařovský and Czech structuralism. Structuralism, along with Russian Formalism,
laid the foundations for narratology, but the distinctive quality of Czech structural-
ism is its emphasis upon dynamic, temporal systemic process over the spatializing
tendencies that are so prominent in the historically more dominant French tradition.
302
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

Mukařovský’s concept of contexture articulates very clearly the way in which the
sequential unfolding of narrative is distinct from the progressively emerging sys-
temic whole of its semiotic structure. The focus of attention here is the unfolding
event of the interpretative reception of a narrative, in the course of which meaning
accumulates in cycles of sequential progression and retrospection.
This process of signiﬁcation unfolds the polyfunctionality of language, notably in
two ways that resonate speciﬁcally with narrative: the orientation of language
towards subject or object, which correspond to the communicative and representa-
tional axes of narrative; and the reﬂexive potential opened up by this double orien-
tation, in which both dimensions of the function of signs may themselves become the
object of signiﬁcation.
Mukařovský’s ideas are elaborated within the horizons of a theory of art, and are
oriented towards a deﬁnition of the aesthetic. Narrative ﬁction constitutes only part
of his object, though a paradigmatic part; but it might also be said that narrative more
broadly understood, beyond ﬁction and indeed beyond discourse as an elemental
semiotic logic, might still partake of the formal dynamics that are here designated as
the properties of the aesthetic function.
4.4
Narrating Complexity
The orientation of this chapter is towards the complexity of narrative rather than the
narration of complexity, but its implicit consequences for the latter are signiﬁcant. An
autopoietic conception of narrative foregrounds the extent to which the system of
narrative meaning, most especially in its ﬁctional and artistic forms, has the capacity
to extend far beyond the bare sequential logic of its formal inception. This is apparent
in the reﬂexive movement of ﬁctionality itself as a dissociation of narrative meaning
from its informative relation to an object of representation; but it is also apparent,
more inclusively, from the perspective of a (cross-)cultural history of narrative,
conceived as a history of reﬂexive displacements of the received parameters of
narrative meaning—both beyond and within the rhetoric of ﬁctionality. Equally, it
is clear that analogous reﬂexive negotiations with form can elaborate upon the
systemic capacity of narrative meaning even within the dynamic unfolding of a
particular narrative. All these considerations are highly suggestive, in principle, of
the possibilities for narrating complexity.

The Proteus Principle (Pianzola, Chap. 10)
5.1
Overview
Pianzola’s interest is a methodological concern for the future of the ﬁeld of narrative
studies. In considering narrative as a complex system he means to address not just
22
Commentary on Contributions
303

the qualities of speciﬁc narratives, nor even narrative form in the abstract, but rather
the concept of narrative as an object of theoretical inquiry. He invokes Meir
Sternberg’s Proteus Principle as the key to a comparative methodology capable of
evaluating the relative merits of narrative theories of different scopes and in different
contexts.
5.2
Complexity
The Proteus Principle afﬁrms the many-to-many correlations between forms and
functions in narrative. Pianzola identiﬁes this as a systems idea with a more general
methodological applicability, and relates it to a distinction between the organization
and structure of systems derived from Maturana and Varela, in which structure is a
particular conﬁguration of components instantiating the more abstract organization
of a system.
In the exposition of this idea and its applicability to narrative concepts and
deﬁnitions on different scales, Pianzola invokes concepts of level and scope drawn
from theories of emergence, and by privileging scope he lays the emphasis upon the
determining role of observation. The system of concern, and the organization that it
exhibits, are conditioned by the scope of our observation, such that systemic organi-
zation on other scales may be understood in terms of the target system’s environment,
or its sub-systems.
Form and function, as the relational concepts proposed by the Proteus Principle,
can analogously be understood as products of particular determinations of the scope
and context of the narrative system that a given theory takes as its object of inquiry,
and equivalences of either form or function, across different instances of the other,
provide for the possibility of dialogue between incommensurate narrative paradigms.
5.3
Narrative
Pianzola has in his sights the typological tendencies that continue to bear witness to
the legacy of structuralism in narrative theory. Such approaches treat the semiotic
function of narrative features as innate in their discursive form, rather than contin-
gent upon the relation between discourse and audience. Importantly, though, in
afﬁrming a view of this relation as intrinsic to the intelligibility of narrative, Pianzola
also recognizes that “discourse” and “audience” are themselves concepts speciﬁc to
the scope of a given theoretical frame of reference (and he notes how the relation
might be better expressed in other terms, for instance “stimuli” and “agent,” on other
scales). The pragmatist, constructivist view of narrative meaning here is therefore
systemically recursive, rather than positing a foundational subject-object relation at
any level. One advantage of this approach is that it accommodates a diachronic view
of the development of narrative as a mode of signiﬁcation, in terms of the feedback
304
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

loop between discourses and audiences, or perhaps more generally between forms
and occasions, that can be traced on several temporal and conceptual scales. This
logic offers a purchase upon, for example, the place of narrative in individual
learning and development, the cultural history of narrative forms, and even the
evolutionary emergence of narrative cognition.
5.4
Narrating Complexity
The methodological orientation of Pianzola’s argument is better captured by the idea
of theorizing the complexity of concepts of narrative than by the speciﬁc challenge of
narrating complexity, though there are implications for that challenge in his appeal to
the Proteus Principle as the foundation for a consolidation of narrative studies. The
argument is couched in terms of the theoretical domain of narrative studies, but it
provides for dialogue not only between theoretical paradigms, but also between
narrative theory and practice. Just as the diachronic study of narrative requires a
recognition of the cyclical reciprocity between forms and functions, discourses and
audiences, so the role of narrative theory itself is not extrinsic to the current and
potential affordances of narrative. As Pianzola notes, the narrative domain continues
to evolve, and the prominence of systems thinking in current thinking about narrative
and narrative theory suggests that there are good prospects for the emergence of new
affordances for narrating complexity.

Narrative Experiences of History and Complex Systems
(Turina, Chap. 11)
6.1
Overview
Turina examines the relation between narrative and complex systems in our under-
standing of historical events, and in the discourse of historiography itself. She
identiﬁes the challenge to the characteristically narrative form of historiographic
understanding presented by the inherently systemic nature of historical events; but
she also demonstrates that such narratives, as elements of the sphere of social and
political discourse, are implicated within the systemic feedback loops of history
itself. She illustrates the issues with respect to the history of Trieste, and explores the
potential of interactive virtual reality technologies to enhance our ability to grasp the
processes involved.
22
Commentary on Contributions
305

6.2
Complexity
Turina makes the basic point that the events with which history is concerned are
inherently complex phenomena and so are necessarily imposed upon in important
ways by their subjection to narrative forms of historiographic representation. This is
not the main point of her argument, however; more signiﬁcant is the fact historical
events are ongoing, and the public discourse of historiography is itself one of the
forces in play. The feedback loops between dominant historical narratives and the
political and social realities they represent have a powerful inﬂuence upon the course
of events themselves. In the ideologically charged domain of events concerning the
multiple conﬂicting social interests, there is no possibility of maintaining a distinction
between what happens and representations of what happens. Turina notes that this is
not just a matter of the coarse ideological power of dominant narratives, since even
rigorous academic efforts to critique such narratives, and to present counternarratives,
ﬁnd themselves caught up in the reactive logic consequent upon the priming effect of
established narratives and the antithetical status of the “silent histories” that might be
pitted against them; there is no objective ground on which to stand.
6.3
Narrative
The narrative focus of this chapter is not primarily the achieved historiographical
narrative that articulates a particular perspective and interpretation of evidence, but
rather the “narrative matrix,” the set of intersecting, complementary or conﬂicting
micro-level narratives relating to a given historical moment. This move, while accepting
that the impositions of narrative form are already present at any level of historical
representation, nonetheless conceives the web of these micro-narratives as raw, systemic
material relative to the order imposed upon them by any synthetic historical narrative. In
response to the inescapable contingencies of historiography, Turina identiﬁes two
possible broad approaches to the narrative matrix. The ﬁrst, weaker response is one
that historiography routinely adopts and is already embedded in historical education; it
undertakes the task of constructing a narrative reading, while emphasizing the contin-
gencies of any single interpretation of the material. The stronger response, advocated by
Turina, aims to remain in process, in an act of narrative sensemaking conscious of its
own negotiation with, and intervention in, the narrative matrix rather than an orientation
towards the achieved product of interpretation.
6.4
Narrating Complexity
The narrative potential of virtual reality technologies has to do with this second
stance in relation to narrative matrices. Turina considers game engines as the most
306
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

developed implementations of simulated interactive environments, and envisages
the use of such engines for historiographic narrative matrices, enabling the interac-
tive engagement of a player to function as an enactment of the process of narrative
engagement with systemic materials. The attractions of this proposition are, ﬁrstly,
that as an immersive form of interpretative engagement it can make the player’s
ongoing negotiation between different perspectives itself a consequential factor in
the system, exhibiting priming effects and facilitating recursive meta-reﬂections
upon the historiographic sensemaking in process; secondly, and more fundamen-
tally, such simulations (as themselves both environments and representations) may
make tangible the conﬂict between complexity and narrative, as a tension between
systemic experientiality and the semiotic pursuit of sequential coherence. Turina
maps this opposition (via the Platonic distinction between mimesis and diegesis)
onto the classic pair of narratological concepts, showing and telling.

(Gardening) Gardening (Caves & Melo, Chap. 13)
7.1
Overview
Caves and Melo write about a novel process for building models of complex
systems, focussing on the relationships between system components. They use a
well-known complex system, the garden, to ground their description. The process
supports the building of a modelworld, the basis for a predeﬁned storyworld from
which explanatory narratives may then be constructed.
7.2
Complexity
One thing that makes complex systems hard to grapple with, certainly from a science
and engineering perspective, is the close coupling between the components. Some-
thing changing here affects something else there. Good engineering design tries to
decouple as much as possible, and reductionist science assumes such decoupling is
possible, so that components can be analysed, designed, and understood in isolation.
Complex systems also have multiway coupling: (nearly) everything is coupled to
(nearly) everything else. Something changing here affects something else every-
where. And something changing anywhere else affects something here. Everything
is related to everything else.
Caves and Melo have taken this relational view, and used it to build a process for
analysing complex systems, particularly systems where there are explicit interven-
tions intended to change or maintain the system. Their focus is not on the compo-
nents, but on the relations. Once analysed, these relations can be considered as new
components, themselves related to other parts, resulting in a growing mesh of
relationships, explicitly focussed on the couplings. This allows the authors to build
22
Commentary on Contributions
307

a modelworld not of components, but of relations. The coupling is built into the
model as a ﬁrst class component in its own right. The framework crucially includes
modelling of interventions: the relationships between the intervenor(s) and the
system.
The existence of a discipline such as General Systems Theory points to (the belief
in) the existence of universal patterns across a range of disparate systems. That
implies that this relational framework, illustrated through gardening, should be
applicable to other domains. For gardening, interventions include processes such
as weeding, pruning, planting, and fertilising. The framework will need augmenta-
tion for cases where a different complex system (that is not a garden) contains
entities (that are not plants) that deserve ethical consideration in their own right, and
where the intervenors are much more part of (comprise) the system under change
itself. It will be exciting to see this new relational model-building process applied
across a range of complex systems.
7.3
Narrative
There are two narratives exploited in this chapter: one explicit and one implicit.
The explicit part is the discussion of how the built complex relational modelworld
can provide the underpinnings for a storyworld—for then building narrative(s) to
explore and explain the modelworld (and, consequently, the real world). This is
analogous to the considerable emphasis upon world building that underpins (some)
science ﬁction and fantasy tales.
The focus in Caves and Melo’s chapter is on narratives that help explore how to
guide change of the world, rather than narratives of living in an unchanging, or
uncontrolledly changing, world. The narrative structures discussed all assume that
the Gardener (intervenor) is the protagonist, and classify the different kinds of
gardeners, some of whom will be heroes, some anti-heroes, according to the
circumstances. The process of intervening, coupled with self-reﬂection, will cause
the intervenors to change, and their characters to progress. In this light, we look
forward someday to reading:
From Menace to Master: Relata Hunter intervenes on the Garden Planet of Complexus
Majoris III (a science ﬁction trilogy)
There is also implicit narrative, in the very structure of the chapter. Unlike many
impersonal accounts, it captures the process the authors went through in devising
their framework. This works well, because the process of using the framework is
crucial, and the narrative style helps highlight the design process itself: the decisions,
the false starts, the roads not taken, the self-reﬂection. The style is additionally
narrative in that it focuses on a single concrete example, a single story, that of the
gardening domain, instead of more abstractly describing a fully generic process
applicable to any complex domain.
308
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

7.4
Narrating Complexity
Scientiﬁc descriptions need some form of narrative structure to make them compre-
hensible. Ideas must build up in a logical manner. Goals, methods, and results must
be presented clearly. Despite the somewhat narrative structure, the underlying
“story” here is essentially impersonal. This can often be true in “hard” science ﬁction
and other genres, where the phrases “idea as hero”1, “plot as hero” 2 and “landscape
novel”3 (in contrast to the character-driven “portrait novel”) have been used.
Such scientiﬁc description might be argued to be mere structured description
rather than narrative per se. In particular, there is a timelessness about such descrip-
tions: they are typically neither anchored in a particular time, nor have an internal
temporal structure. However, complex systems are inherently dynamic. They
change, develop, evolve, die. They more readily admit a narrative description.
This Gardening framework chapter illustrates the value of a narrative approach to
complex systems understanding: the approach highlights and foregrounds the
processual nature of developing the complex modelworld: a narrative process to
build a descriptive model, which may then itself be illuminated by further narratives
from the associated storyworld.

The Software Garden (Miller, Chap. 15)
8.1
Overview
Miller proposes a new kind of approach for the difﬁcult, intricate and error-prone
task of building software. The idea is to embrace the complexity of the process by
developing an explicit analogue: how people build a garden. Miller wants to plant
software seeds, and visually grow, prune, and train them into complex software
artefacts.
8.2
Complexity
Software is complex to build and complex to understand. This complexity seems to
derive from three main aspects.
Firstly, software is incredibly fragile: the smallest change to the software (a single
character error) can completely change the nature of its behaviour, manifesting as
subtle bugs through to hanging, crashing, blue-screening, bricking or many other
1Kingsley Amis. New Maps of Hell: A Survey of Science Fiction. Penguin, 1960.

colourful terms used by the community to describe a computer that has
unintentionally stopped computing. This is sensitive dependence on initial condi-
tions par excellence.
Secondly, software is invisible. Software has an abstract high-dimensional struc-
ture, which can be hard to discover from the textual code, or even from accompanying
diagrams. And executing software is essentially dynamic: it has complex behaviour
over time, as the consequences of executing the various algorithms unfold. This
dynamic behaviour is barely reﬂected in the static text of the code: one can “read
through” the code, but in order to deduce the route to be taken through its branching
and cyclic pathways, one needs to somehow execute the statements. It becomes
almost impossible to comprehend both the abstract structure and the complex
dynamics together. There are diagrammatic forms that help to summarise the tempo-
ral aspects, but they are all impoverished in some way or another, due to the sheer
complexity of the actual dynamic behaviours. This invisibility is one thing that makes
it hard to build truly high level reusable components: it is hard for the user of such
components to grasp their intended behavioural structure. Invisibility also contributes
to the difﬁculty of maintenance: diving into a mature piece of software to discern
where the errors are, or where new functionality can be added, is a non-trivial skill.
Thirdly, software is constructed at a very low level. Although programming
languages such as Python, Java, and C++ are called “high level”, this is only relative
to the lowest level assembly languages and machine code. If using machine code is
like constructing a skyscraper from individual atoms, then using “high level”
languages is like constructing it from individual pebbles. But it is not a static
skyscraper being constructed in software; it is a whirling, twirling, gyring, growing,
adapting, changing complex arrangement of dynamic “pebbles”. Coding is akin to
trying to make a living organism by placing each individual cell.
Miller tackles all these issues in his proposal for a new way to build software: a
Software Garden. He uses the concept of horticulture as an analogy for his process
for developing robust, visible, high level software. Plants are not so fragile that
minor damage to one leaf destroys that plant, let alone the entire garden. A garden is
a highly visible artefact that can be viewed from many perspectives, and
apprehended at many spatial and temporal scales. Gardeners do not construct
individual plants, nor do they build mature gardens with fully grown plants, nor
do they expect the garden to function without continual maintenance and change.
8.3
Narrative
Miller’s Software Garden would support narratives for designing, constructing,
running, and modifying software.
For such a dynamic artefact, there is surprisingly little focus on narrative for
describing traditional software. At the stage of requirements elicitation, the Uniﬁed
Modelling approach involves deﬁning use cases, each use case being a description of
how the system is used to achieve a particular goal. If there are many potential paths

to achieving a goal, each separate one can be described using a speciﬁc scenario.
This focus on use, or process, or dynamics, often gives way to a focus on structure
once these requirements are turned into a design for satisfying them. Later in the
design phase, graphical representations called state diagrams might be used to show
the life history of a single component, and sequence diagrams might be used to to
show how multiple components interact, leading to emergent system-level behav-
iours. These diagrams could be thought of as primitive narratives, capturing at least
potential linear temporal sequences of events.
Miller’s proposal changes the opportunities for narrative, raising the level from
simple events to interactions and processes analogous to those in horticulture,
including “pruning, fertilising, spraying, training, grafting and breeding”.

Narrating Complexity
In Caves and Melo’s “Gardening Gardening” (Chap. 13), they use the garden as an
exemplar in order to make concrete their proposed design process. Miller here uses
the garden as an analogy for proposing a novel software development process that
would have many of the abstract attributes of gardening. Is gardening itself a
complex system that we humans understand well enough that it can act as a starting
point for developing theories of complex narratives and approaches to narrating
complexity?

Emergent Causality in Complex Films and Complex
Systems (Poulaki, Chap. 16)
9.1
Overview
The core of Poulaki’s argument is the idea that certain complex ﬁlms often
characterised as “network narratives” resist linear, narrative ideas of causality, and
provoke or require interpretation as complex systems. She examines a range of
emergent and systemic models of causality, drawing upon emergentist philosophy,
cybernetics and social network theory among others, showing the inadequacy of
narrative understanding to such ideas and exploring their potential as ways of moving
beyond narrative.

9.2
Complexity
Beginning with notions of strong and weak emergence, Poulaki shows that a narrative
mode of understanding cannot capture the mechanisms involved, both because of the
multiplicity of interactions and (more fundamentally) because of the categorical shift
in levels that characterises emergence as such. Nonetheless, forms of determination
that can appropriately be called causal are clearly involved. Poulaki explores the ways
in which these effects have been theorised in terms of cybernetic models of feedback
loops, the effects of mathematical nonlinearity characteristic of such models and the
non-equilibrium dynamics of complex systems; she afﬁrms a view of emergence
grounded upon a “pattern-based” form of causality that disallows both reductionist
causal accounts and the causal disconnect of strong emergentism.
9.3
Narrative
Poulaki notes that while the form of causality projected by narrative cognition cannot
accommodate complex processes, models of narrative itself need not be incompatible
with systemic complexity. She invokes the dynamic cycles of equilibrium and
disequilibrium in Todorov’s deﬁnition of narrative; and she traces, between the
Aristotelian and structuralist traditions of narrative theory, a concern with wholes
and a layered network of relations (treated somewhat statically and spatially in early
structuralism, but more dynamically as it moved towards post-structuralism). The
implication is that the process of narrative interpretation is necessarily a negotiation
with complex systemic relations of signiﬁcation. This is necessarily the case to some
extent for any narrative whole, of whatever scale or degree of sophistication, but
Poulaki’s speciﬁc interest is in forms of “complex narrative,” notably in ﬁlm, that
ostentatiously frustrate the linear causal paradigm privileged by narrative cognition.
Here, the usual dynamics of interpretative engagement with systemic relations at the
level of the represented events (in itself a prominent feature of the more elaborate
kinds of realist ﬁction) is compounded by an analogous systemic complexity in the
development of the syuzhet, or narrative discourse, itself.
9.4
Narrating Complexity
A complex narrative is not in itself a narration of complexity; its complexiﬁcation of
narration is rather a resistance to the logic of narration that enacts, in the process of
interpretation, an encounter with complexity. The cultural elaboration of narrative in
general can be understood as a cumulative series of efforts to break narrative, to
exceed its limitations. It seems signiﬁcant that many contemporary cultural narratives
(Poulaki’s ﬁlm examples, but also a signiﬁcant number of recent novels, for example)
312
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

have focussed speciﬁcally upon the limitations of narrative’s grasp upon complexity.
Poulaki ends by noting that this systemic confrontation with narrative understanding
works at the level of our interpretative negotiations with the narrative in process, the
transgressive experience of which is privileged over any ﬁnal achieved form, which
must collapse back into the familiar mould of narrative logic. But she envisages the
possibility that such modes of meaning may eventually emancipate themselves from
narrative and function as new, systemic forms of organization in their own right.

Narrative and Cognitive Modelling (Bernini, Chap. 17)
10.1
Overview
Bernini’s essay considers the mind as a complex system, and consciousness and the
sense of selfhood as emergent phenomena. He proposes that Samuel Beckett’s work
can be understood as a sustained effort to decompose these effects into their complex
systemic causes, through a strategy he calls “ﬁctional cognitive modelling.” The
conﬂict between narrative understanding and complex systems, in this account, is
mediated by a “narrative dynamic core” to Beckett’s explorations of the mind’s
complexity.
10.2
Complexity
The challenge of complexity is framed, in Bernini’s account, in terms of modelling.
He notes that an adequate model must capture features of a system’s complexity,
rather than just representing the systemic whole, but without itself becoming a
complex system as inscrutable as the target system. The differences between model
and target are as important as the equivalences, and the formal simpliﬁcations
involved are pragmatically justiﬁed by the particular purposes of the model. Bernini
distinguishes between descriptive, predictive, explanatory and exploratory models,
and it is the last of these he goes on to invoke as the orientation of Beckett’s modelling
strategies. There is an additional, more speciﬁc difﬁculty that arises when the target
system is the complexity of mind, which is of course that it is the system within which
our cognitive engagement is itself enmeshed. For Bernini, and for Beckett, the
reﬂexivity this entails is both a problem and an opportunity; it provides a rationale
for introspection, not in order to isolate the object of inquiry so much as to engage
with it in the process. Fictional cognitive modelling, then, is a form of “experiential
art” that seeks to capture something of the mind’s complexity reﬂexively, by enacting
it as much as by representing it.

10.3
Narrative
Narrative ﬁgures in this account in two mutually implicated but conceptually distinct
respects. The ﬁrst foregrounds the way narrative constrains our ability to make sense
of complex processes, characterizing it (after Abbott) as inherently imposing a model
of centralized control that fundamentally conﬂicts with the distributed nature of such
processes. In this respect narrative always seizes upon effects of emergence, at the
expense of the process by which the effects emerge. In the second sense, however,
narrative (more speciﬁcally, for Bernini, the narrative sense of self) features as itself
an emergent phenomenon. In this sense, the reﬂexiveness of the effort to understand
mind is a speciﬁcally narrative reﬂexiveness, so that the challenge—and Beckett’s
strategy—is to catch narrative cognition in the process of formation. Bernini charac-
terizes such decomposed, or precomposed, ur-narrative matter as the “narrative
dynamic core,” and identiﬁes language, time, agents and imagination as its constitu-
tive elements.
10.4
Narrating Complexity
The effort to grasp the complexity of mind does not entail the impossible task of
bridging, in a single span, the “explanatory gap” between the mental phenomena of
consciousness and the neurological structure of the brain. Such a binary model is itself
reductive, neglecting the evident involvement of many layers of complexity and
emergence in this transit. Some of this recursive layering, at least, is accessible from
the perspective of introspection, and the rigorous effort to attend to processes of
emergence at that level is already an important advance in understanding of the
mind’s complex systemic constitution. This is the light in which Bernini understands
Beckett’s efforts to unpick the threads of narrative representation in order to reﬂexively
model the emergence of a narrative sense of self. The difﬁculty, and value, of Beckett’s
work in part consists in its sustained effort to push us to the threshold of narrative
sense, further into the process of its emergence than we are accustomed to go. Bernini
brieﬂy illustrates two sides of this effort in examples from Beckett: an analytic strategy
that isolates components of the emergent self in “local models,” and a synthetic
strategy that offers “global models” of the interaction between components. In both
cases Beckett’s exploratory models extend our understanding of the complex pro-
cesses of the mind, and breach the ordinary limits of narrative sensemaking itself.

Narratives for Drug Design (Bown & Goltsov, Chap. 18)
11.1
Overview
Bown and Goltsov discuss the potential uses of narrative in helping drug researchers
understand complex signalling pathways in cancer cells. They suggest the use of
dynamic visualisation, guided by the user, as input material for building a narrative.
11.2
Complexity
Biological systems are complex. They have evolved over billions of years into
highly structured, organised, exquisitely poised, and mostly incomprehensible sys-
tems. Many of our scientiﬁc understanding tools are geared towards simpler systems,
where particles are identical, where variation is “noise,” where averages and equi-
librium hold sway. Biological systems are of a different kind: highly evolved to be
far from equilibrium, and where variation is literally the driving force of their
Darwinian evolution. Biological systems are complex on many levels: cells, tissues,
organs, organisms, ecosystems. Moreover, where disease is concerned, these sys-
tems are embedded in a further complex socio-technical system: healthcare.
In this chapter the focus is on a single biological level: signalling pathways within
a cancerous cell. This necessary simpliﬁcation has not made the system simple: it
exhibits emergence, downward causation (tumour tissue environmental effects),
genetic mutation, cross-talk and feedback, and changing network topology.
Targeted drug design, needed to ﬁx or kill the dysfunctional cancerous cells,
requires an understanding of this dynamic complexity, and in particular of the way
the system responds to different perturbations. The authors discuss ways this might
be achieved, via visualisation and narrative.
11.3
Narrative
Visualisation is a powerful method for allowing people to explore and discover
patterns in complex situations. A picture, even a dynamic representation, is not itself
a narrative, however. The authors discuss how visualisations of complex systems
might be used, interactively by the researchers, to explore the behaviour of a complex
system, as a vehicle for discovering and building relevant explanatory narratives.
They ﬁnish with an interesting suggestion of exploiting ideas from graphic novels to
deliver the explanatory narrative so discovered.

11.4
Narrating Complexity
When conveying complex spatial relationships, diagrams help communication. When
conveying complex temporal behaviours, animations help communication. So it
seems plausible that in order to narrate complex systems well, some form of animated
images will be needed. This increases the dimensionality of what is being presented in
linear temporal sequence, from words, read or spoken, to two-dimensional or three-
dimensional (holographic) images: movies. Although a moving image is not neces-
sarily a narrative, narrating complexity might require a movie, or at least a graphic
novel.

Time Will Tell (Caves, Melo, Stepney & Uprichard,
Chap. 19)
12.1
Overview
Narrative is the semiotic articulation of linear temporal sequence. Complex systems
are not timeless or static, but fundamentally historical and dynamic processes. But
what is time? Caves, Melo, Stepney and Uprichard survey and review some aspects
of time, from the perspectives of the physical sciences, biological sciences, and
social sciences. From this it is clear that the time underpinning complex systems and
their narration is not some uniform substrate, but is itself complex.
12.2
Complexity
There are several sources of temporal complexity in complex systems.
Firstly, there are multiple timescales. There is a natural timescale from “birth” to
“death,” the timescale on which a process or entity exists as a relatively stable
structure. A complex system has processes and entities on multiple levels, each
with their own timescales (our cells turn over on a much shorter timescale than we
ourselves live). Additionally, complex systems are open, embedded in an environ-
ment which has its own natural timescales (physically realised days, months,
seasons, years, geological epochs, etc; social constructs of weeks, school terms,
election cycles, etc). The combinations and interplay of all these timescales leads to
complexity.
Secondly, there is the invisible temporal activity maintaining a process or entity in
a relatively stable state. In the dominant substance worldview, equilibrium stability
is the norm, and only change requires explanation. But on taking a process-oriented
worldview, change is the default state, and it is stability that requires an explanation.
Now the far-from-equilibrium stability of a complex system, its apparent lack of
316
R. Walsh and S. Stepney

change despite the passage of time, as it works to maintain its position by “walking
up a down escalator,” is in need of investigation and explanation.
Thirdly, there is feedback. Feedback is essential in the maintenance of a stable
complex system, and contributes also to its non-linear behaviours. Complex
interconnected feedback loops on different timescales mean that simple descriptions
of causality do not work. This complex “loopiness” means that no simple linearisation
of description and explanation is possible.
12.3
Narrative
Caves et al. suggest that the complexity of the time underpinning complex systems
may be why they resist narrative. That is, the cognitive challenge that complex
processes present to narrative understanding is twofold: they exceed the mind’s
capacity to trace and follow the complex dynamics of multiple interfering chains of
interaction, but moreover, they elude the model of temporality itself presupposed by
narrative.
Narrative cognition assumes, and perhaps produces, one of our basic ways of
grasping temporality, but that model breaks down in the face of complex systems.
However, our sense of time is not entirely narrative dependent: consider how time
can be mapped onto spatial concepts in diagrams, for example. The result may be
perplexity—the tendency to generate paradoxes of temporality, for example—but it
may also offer possibilities for productive conceptual dissociation from our
ingrained forms of cognition and representation.
12.4
Narrating Complexity
The multiplicity of timescales in a complex system presents a challenge. Interlocking
timescales may make it difﬁcult to capture the rhythm or tempo of the system.
Focussing on one timescale may ignore crucial properties happening on other time-
scales. Mismatched timescales may make it difﬁcult to communicate the different
parts coherently. Timescales that are outside our human comprehension (ultra-fast or
ultra-slow) are difﬁcult to communicate, even metaphorically. For example, Carl
Sagan’s “Cosmic Calendar” maps the history of the universe onto a year, with the
totality of human history and prehistory then being a mere ten seconds or so at the end,
and with modern history occupying just the last second. This provides some perspec-
tive, but it is still difﬁcult to truly internalise the difference between these vastly
different timescales in any essential manner: we can conceptualise a year, and also a
few seconds, but rarely simultaneously.
The invisibility of complex self-organising processes can present problems and
opportunities for narrative: ﬁrstly, recognising that something needs to be explained,
even though nothing appears to be happening; secondly, ﬁnding a way to narrate that
22

317

nothingness in an intelligible manner. Narratives of inactivity have a difﬁcult, avant-
garde quality precisely because they are refusing a basic expectation of narrative
sense. This avant-garde difﬁculty can be compelling, however.
The feedback circularity of complex systems resists any simple linearisation. This
potentially presents the major challenge for narrating complex systems: how to
linearise the system for narrative in a way that does not grossly over-simplify, or
worse still miss, its essential circularity? Of course, the linear structure of a narrative
in no way has to map naively onto the temporal structure of the narrated, but when the
two are structured so fundamentally differently, new approaches are required.
One further relevant feedback complexity not noted by Caves et al., but raised by
Turina (Chap. 11) and Bernini (Chap. 17), is when the complex system (in these
cases, history, and the mind, respectively) is inﬂuenced by its narratives, reﬂexively
deepening and further complexifying the feedbacks, and enlarging the scope of the
relevant system to include its own narratives and their effects (compare with
Winﬁeld’s robots, Chap. 4).
The issues discussed in this book are manifold, yet tackling them is necessary to
narrating complexity; that is, to the challenge of narrating some of the most pressing
problems facing us today, and learning how to read and interpret such complex
narratives.

Chapter 23
From Simplex to Complex Narrative?
Susan Stepney and Richard Walsh
Abstract This concluding chapter recaps the challenges to narrative understanding
presented by complex systems, and speculates upon the prospects for meeting these
challenges through different conceptions of “complex narrative”.
The importance of understanding, explaining and managing complex systems is self-
evident. They include many of the most important systems in today’s world,
including the environment and ecology, climate and pollution, economic and market
structures, cities and transport networks, population and migration, the frameworks
of democracy and political agency, information media, social and political struc-
tures, healthcare, food and water security. Our ability to grasp the way complex
systems work, and so to discuss and debate these issues and arrive at judgements, is
substantially dependent upon the ability to make narrative sense of them: narrative
cognition is our innate means of understanding processes, and to a large extent it sets
the terms for what constitutes such understanding. Yet complex systemic processes
have many properties that, individually and in combination, present major obstacles
to both descriptive and narrative modes of representation and understanding:
•
Feedback and temporal “loopiness,” which does not allow any simple linear-
isation of cause and effect
•
Emergence, where the behaviour of the whole cannot be readily deduced from
the behaviours of the parts, and where the whole affects the parts
•
Relational nature, where the many-to-many interactions between the component
parts are more pertinent to the system behaviour than are the parts themselves

•
Openness, in that a complex system cannot be understood in isolation, because of
its essential interactions with its environment
•
Reﬂexiveness, in social systems, where narratives of the system are also within
the system, affecting it
•
Stability in the face of change, where the stability is not passively static, but an
active self-maintenance that needs to be supported
•
Tipping points of rapid unexpected change in the face of small perturbations, as a
seemingly stable complex system is ﬁnally pushed beyond its limits
•
Multiple timescales, fast and slow, many beyond human perception
•
Multiple spatial scales, large and small, also beyond human perception
If we are to understand our complex world, perhaps we need more complex
narratives to help us engage with its processes, and bring them into human compre-
hension. But what could a concept like “complex narrative” actually mean? Is it
possible to envisage it? And would it help?
It should be recognised, ﬁrst, that narratives are complex: while the fundamental
logic that gives them form is hostile to complexity, its semiotic articulation neces-
sarily proliferates meaning in implicit and open-ended ways, so that the interpreta-
tion of narrative is always to some degree a negotiation with the complexity of
semiotic systems. Even as narratives harness semiotic media to impose the reductive
logic of narrative form, the latent complexity of those semiotic systems is continu-
ally threatening to exceed that logic. This tension presents an opportunity, perhaps,
but also a caution.
Extended and elaborate forms of narrative can offer declarative knowledge in
narrative form, but also knowledge by acquaintance, in the interpretative process,
with their own complexity as systems of meaning. Can this duality be harnessed?
One possible avenue of inquiry is reﬂexiveness; indeed, the cultural history of the
development of sophisticated narrative forms can be understood as a long series of
reﬂexive moves, explicit and implicit, by which the constraints of narrative logic
have been trumped and transcended. If other limitations of narrative form have been
mitigated by this device, perhaps the same can be done for its resistance to com-
plexity. The prospect seems all the more promising because reﬂexiveness is itself
characteristic of complex interactions, and every reﬂexive move invites and encour-
ages the recognition that it could be recursively applied. Reﬂexive moves therefore
directly gesture beyond the linearity of narrative logic, allowing narratives to lead
readers/audiences across the threshold from that logic to the complexity of their
semiotic systems.
There are limits to the potential of such approaches, however. The constraints of
narrative are more fundamental than the drag of its legacy cultural forms, and efforts
to complexify it always risk subverting its sense-making capacity without generating
other kinds of intelligibility. Self-consciously complexiﬁed narratives are intrinsi-
cally difﬁcult narratives, and if a narrative purchase upon complex systems can be
achieved only by reproducing the cognitive difﬁculty presented by the complex
system in the form of the narrative itself, it isn’t clear what has been gained. The
problem is even more pointed in the public sphere. There the pull towards narrative
complexity runs up against a fundamental reason why narrative is a privileged mode
of communication, which is its directness and simplicity. It is certainly important to
320
S. Stepney and R. Walsh

resist the tendency for politicians, lobbyists and decision makers to rely upon crude
“sound bite” narrative explanations, which not only produce bad arguments, they
also discredit good ones; but failure to communicate is not an advance upon
reductive communication.
Less immediate beneﬁts of narrative complexiﬁcation may still be worth pursu-
ing, though it is important to discriminate between the prospects of different
approaches. One broad point is that there can be a cumulative effect from the
proliferation of narratives that self-consciously foreground their own formal explo-
ration of complexity. As with other kinds of innovation in the past, the gradual
assimilation of such strategies amounts to a reﬁnement of narrative literacy. There is
an obvious analogy with the early history of ﬁlm here: over a period of about twenty
years this new medium evolved from a spectacular illusion, grasped primarily in
terms of an almost magical power to reproduce life itself, into a sophisticated vehicle
of narrative with its own formal idiom. Notably, this evolution was the result of
communicative feedback loops between ﬁlm-makers and audiences, often negoti-
ated through highly self-conscious, reﬂexive ﬁlmic devices.
Such a development towards complex narrative might also offer an advance in
complexity literacy, and be of value in those terms, but it does not in itself provide
for a more effective narrative grasp upon complex systemic subject matter. The
complexity it foregrounds is that latent in the semiotics of narrative representation
itself, rather than that of any particular system with which such a narrative might
engage. There is a general metaphorical or analogical relation between the two, but
an encounter with semiotic and formal complexity in narrative interpretation is
different in kind from the effort to produce adequate narrative representations of
other kinds of complex system. And indeed, to the extent that a narrative merely
reproduces complexity rather than mediating it, the result presents essentially the
same challenges to comprehension as the represented system itself.
There are some complex systems that we can come to understand through
continual embedded interactions; we acquire an experiential knowledge by acquain-
tance that exceeds the propositional knowledge of narrative cognition. This may be
why gardening, as both an exemplar and an analogy, has played a signiﬁcant role in
this book. But we cannot engage with larger and slower, or smaller and faster,
systems in such an embedded way; and here perhaps there is a productive way in
which we might engage with relevant narratives instead. It is possible that the
interpretative complexity of the experience of narrative can be made into a vehicle
for the speciﬁc modelling of some target complex system, so that both the systemic
and the emergent (i.e., narratable) behaviour of the system can be simultaneously
conveyed, in a hybrid form that fuses communication and experience.
Such a hybrid mode of representation seems particularly worth exploring in
interactive media, where the user’s agency can itself become an instance of the
dual perspective required in order to respond to the duality of simulation, as both a
representation of a system and a system in its own right. That is, the user’s inter-
action may be conceived in narrative terms, as a communicative, representational
mode of engagement, or it may be conceived in experiential terms, as a form of
(virtual) agency within a systemic environment; or both.
23
From Simplex to Complex Narrative?
321

A key feature of such interactive narrative environments is the opportunity for
permutation and “replayability,” which provides for a cumulative acquaintance with
the system distinct from any given run through it. But to become a tool of learning or
intellectual engagement with complexity, this capacity needs to be conceived dif-
ferently from the way it is typically exploited at present (in games, for example); that
is, it needs to be dissociated from the idea of a kind of immediacy, or virtual experi-
ence of the represented system itself. This is a naïve fantasy of immersion (very
similar to some early conceptions of cinema), to be contrasted with a lucid awareness
that interactive agency relates to the system of the simulation itself, not its target
system. The target system itself, however, is accessible through the user’s creative
engagement with the simulation’s representational capacity, and this can be explored
through the self-conscious adoption of a co-authorial stance, in interaction with the
simulation itself. By such means we might use the affordances of interactivity to
bring narrative form and systemic behaviour into overt dialogue with each other, and
to mediate between them.
The questions provoked by the problematic encounter between narrative and
complex systems are not susceptible to short answers, and remain open. The issues
raised are far-reaching, not just within the domains of complexity science and
narratology, but for society at large; it is encouraging, then, that these issues are
attracting interest in a striking diversity of contexts, and generating considerable
intellectual energy and innovation. The contributions to this volume reﬂect the
diversity and exemplify the intellectual ferment; they testify to the productivity of
this interdisciplinary dialogue, but they by no means exhaust it.
