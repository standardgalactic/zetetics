ABSTRACT
All clocks, classical or quantum, are open non equilibrium irreversible systems sub-
ject to the constraints of thermodynamics. Using examples I show that these con-
straints necessarily limit the performance of clocks and that good clocks require
large energy dissipation. For periodic clocks, operating on a limit cycle, this is a
consequence of phase diﬀusion. It is also true for non periodic clocks (for example,
radio carbon dating) but due to telegraph noise not to phase diﬀusion. In this case a
key role is played by accurate measurements that decrease entropy, thereby raising
the free energy of the clock, and requires access to a low entropy reservoir. In the
quantum case, for which thermal noise is replaced by quantum noise (spontaneous
emission or tunnelling), measurement plays an essential role for both periodic and
non periodic clocks. The paper concludes with a discussion of the Tolman relations
and Rovelli’s thermal time hypothesis in terms of clock thermodynamics.

Introduction
A clock is a machine and like all machines subject to the laws of thermodynamics.
In popular discussions, a clock is often presented as the epitome of a reversible and
predictable dynamical system. Nothing could be further from the truth. As I will
explain, a careful examination of the requirements for a clock indicates that a clock
cannot be reversible and in fact requires dissipation for correct operation. I will use a
number of examples, both classical and quantum, to illustrate this. I will also discuss
irreversible clocks such as radio carbon dating and Mach’s temperature clock. A uniﬁed
description can be given by focusing on how clocks, as non equilibrium steady state
systems, exploit sources of low entropy energy (high free energy).
There is a bewildering range of clocks, from bio-chemical to astronomical, from
mechanical to stochastic, and it is diﬃcult to give a general deﬁnition of a clock
to cover all instances. A standard dictionary deﬁnition states “a clock is a device to
measure time”, which begs a very much bigger and enduring question. Other deﬁnitions
emphasise the repetitive or periodic nature of clock states, yet radio carbon dating is
a clock that is anything but periodic as was the water clock used by Galileo.

I will take the view that a clock is a physical device used to coordinate local co-
incidences of physical events. This captures the central features of time in General
Relativity; proper time is local and coordinates relationships between local physical
events. Under this deﬁnition clocks can be used to plan ahead by referring to future
coincidences, to sequence historical events (radio-carbon dating), or to synchronize
events in diﬀerent locations for navigation. This deﬁnition also shares some of the
characteristics of distance measurements in enabling us to speak about ‘here and now’.
If clocks do measure time, this deﬁnition captures the relational character of time.
In order to use a physical system to coordinate coincidences, we count the number
of times a recurring physical event is observed to occur in the clock between coincident
events happening here and now and coincident events here and in the future. We can
add to the basic clock a device that keeps the count and displays the number. Clocks
are all about counting.
Length measurements are also about counting: count the number of times a ruler
is placed, end to end, between one point and another. Good rulers are those systems
that do not change their length when used in this way. If they did change, it would
cause the count to vary for repeated measurements of the same distance. Likewise,
good clocks are those for which the number of counts between periodic coincidences
does not ﬂuctuate. Of course in reality there is no perfect ruler; depending on the
material used the length of the ruler could ﬂuctuate a little or a lot. Likewise, there
is no perfect clock. How good a ruler or a clock needs to be depends on the nature
physical events that we seek to coordinate.
2.
The essential irreversible character of periodic clocks.
I will begin with periodic clocks. As any rudimentary textbook on clocks will
describe[1], the simplest such devices are driven, periodic systems, perhaps stabilised
by feedback and with some counting mechanism to track the number of repetitions of
a periodic variable.
The pendulum clock with the escapement mechanism revolutionised the mechanical
clock following its invention by Huygen’s in 1656. It comprises a pendulum that, for
small oscillations in the absence of dissipation, will oscillate at constant amplitude
and frequency (the natural frequency) determined by its length and acceleration due
to gravity. But a pendulum once set in motion will eventually stop oscillating due to
friction between the support and the rod, collisions with air molecules or other uncon-
trollable interactions with the environment. To sustain an oscillation the pendulum
must be driven and this is the role of the escapement in early pendulum clocks.
The purpose of the escapement mechanism is to input energy to the pendulum to
counteract the eﬀects of dissipation. With careful design, the driven pendulum will
settle into a steady oscillation at or close to its natural frequency. We refer to this
sustained oscillation as a limit-cycle; a stable steady state of sustained oscillatory
motion. Limit cycles are common in driven, dissipative non linear systems. Dissipative
attractors, such as a limit cycle, ensure clocks based on this phenomenon are necessarily
stochastic dynamical systems; a necessary consequence of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation
theorem[2].

2.1.
Dissipation and noise in the escapement pendulum clock.
A pendulum, for small oscillations, is a linear dynamical system so how can a limit
cycle occur? It is the driving mechanism of the escapement itself that is responsible
for the non linearity. The magnitude of the impulse delivered depends non linearly on
the angular displacement and possibly the angular velocity. Non linearity is central
to clock design. I will use the Graham escapement mechanism as an example[4, 5]
schematically indicated in Fig.(1) based on the “wheel and anchor” mechanism.

A schematic anchor and escape wheel. The falling mass that provides a constant torque to the
wheel is not shown. As the pendulum unlocks the anchor from its right hand or left hand position, it imparts
a small impulsive torque to the pendulum. The sequence is: left-lock →clockwise kick →free →right-lock →
anticlockwise kick →free →left-lock. Initial transients are not shown.
I will adapt the treatment of [3] to a Hamiltonian phase-space description. For
a pendulum the phase space variables are angular displacement, θ, and the angular
momentum, p. When dissipation and ﬂuctuations are included Hamilton’s equations
are modiﬁed to become Langevin equations. In this case,
˙θ
=
p
mωl
(1)
˙p
=
−mgθ −γp + K(θ, p) + ξ(t)
(2)
where the · indicates a time derivative, m is the mass, ω =
p
g/l is the natural
frequency of the pendulum of length l and γ is the frictional damping rate. The
ﬂuctuating force term ξ(t) is a white noise process of mean zero and (stationary) two-
time correlation function ξ(t)ξ(t + τ) = Dδ(τ). The ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem
requires D = 2mγkBT. The term K(θ, p) describes small impulsive kicks delivered by
the design of the escapement[3].
It is simpler to move to dimensionless variables deﬁned by x = θ and y = p/(mωl)
and a dimensionless time τ = ωt, so that the equations take the form
˙x
=
y
(3)
˙y
=
−x −Γy + K(x, y) + η(t)
(4)

where Γ =
γ
mω2l and η(t) =
ξ(t)
mω2l. For the kicks we take
K(x, y) = −µ sign(sin ψ0 x −cos ψ0 y)
(5)
where ψ0 is ﬁxed by the design of the escapement and µ has units of frequency. This
is a non linear function of the phase space variables. Note that as we are using the
quadratic approximation for the pendulum potential function we need to ensure that
x0 << π/2. We can easily remove this approximation, see [3]. A phase-space picture
of this impulse is shown in Fig. 2. It provides constant kick to the momentum once
every half period. In Fig,3 we plot the dimensionless momentum, y, as a function of

limit cycle is apparent.

In order to extract the limit cycle, deﬁne new variables, r, ψ, by x = r cos ψ and
y = r sin ψ. The time scale of the decay onto the limit cycle (the r(t) dynamics) is
slower than the oscillation frequency on the limit cycle (the ψ(t) dynamics). This
implies that we can average over the oscillatory faster time scale which is equivalent
to averaging over ψ from −π −ψ0 to π −ψ0, the equation for the radial coordinate
4

after averaging is
˙r = −Γr

It is now clear that there is a stable ﬁxed point in the radial coordinate given by,
r∗= 4µ
πΓ cos ψ0
(7)
The dynamics for the phase is
˙ψ = −1 + 2µ
rπ sin ψ0
(8)
The frequency is shifted from that of the free oscillator and only approaches the free
oscillator in a limit such that the size of the impulsive kicks goes to zero.
In scaled units we deﬁne the energy of the oscillator as
E = 1
2(x2 + y2) = 1
2r2
(9)
If we time-average this over the fast oscillations on the limit cycle we ﬁnd that
˙E = −ΓE + 2
√

cos ψ0
(10)
The last term is the average rate at which work is done by the escapement on the
pendulum. The limit cycle forms when the energy lost due to friction is balanced
by the work done by the escapement. The important feature is that the work done
increases with the size of the limit cycle. In the steady state, the average energy on
the limit cycle is
E = 8µ2
Γ2π2 cos2 ψ0
(11)
Of course this result depends on the assumption that the dynamics is deterministic;
noise is neglected.
A dynamical system subject to dissipation must necessarily experience noise. This
is a direct consequence of the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem[7, 2]. The inclusion of
white noise in non linear dynamical problems of this kind is not easy. The nonlinear
transformation to radial and phase variables leads to non linear noise in both ˙r, ˙ψ. I
will simply quote the result in [8] for Ito stochastic diﬀerential equations after phase
averaging,

where dW1(t), dW2(t) are independent Wiener increments (random variables with zero

diﬀusion constant D as
D′ = Dω

(14)
Further details on stochastic diﬀerential equations, Wiener increments and transform-
ing from Langevin equations to Ito equations may be found in [9].
Two important eﬀects are apparent: a small shift in the the radial ﬁxed point and
a non linear diﬀusion in the phase. The radial ﬁxed point is changed to
r∗= 2µ
πΓ cos ψ0 +
r
4µ2
π2Γ2 cos2 ψ0 + D′/4
(15)
We can linearise the eﬀect of phase noise by setting setting r →r∗in the stochastic
term for dψ. This leads to the signiﬁcant fact that the phase diﬀusion gets slower the
larger the limit cycle. For typical pendulum clocks run at room temperature the phase
diﬀusion rate is very small indeed and it is no surprise that this fundamental source
of noise is not at all signiﬁcant for such clocks.
However there are cases, especially for quantum clocks, where the phase noise on the
limit cycle does limit the performance of the clock. The analysis begins by linearising
the noise when the clock has settled onto the limit cycle.
2.2.
Noise and period ﬂuctuations
To understand the eﬀect of noise it is useful to write the kick function directly in terms
of the phase variable on the limit cycle as
K(t) = −µ sign[cos(ψ(t) + ψ0)]
(16)
In the deterministic case, ψ(t) = ˜ωt and this function is periodic on −π/2−ψ0 to 3π/2−
ψ0. The transitions between ±µ occur at regular intervals separated in time by π/˜ω.
As the noise adds a random Gaussian variable to ψ(t) over time t, these transitions
become irregular; some a little early, some a little late. This suggests that the function
K(t) is developing the characteristics of a random telegraph signal (RTS). However
it cannot be a simple RTS with constant transition rates as the transitions are most
likely to occur at particular moments in time near the end points of the oscillation. In

Expanding the sign function in a Fourier series, the ensemble average of the K(t),

To estimate how the noise impacts the time keeping, ﬁx the interval of external
time that passes as T and ask how many ‘ticks’ of the clock occur in this time. In the
clock literature this approach is known as time domain characterisation, as opposed to
the frequency domain where the emphasis is on noise power spectral density[10]. The
escapement force can be used to monitor this count. Each cycle of the square wave
kick function corresponds to one tick of the clock. If there were no noise, a count of M
cycles corresponds to a period in conventional time units of T/M. But in the presence
of noise the count M and thus the assigned period ﬂuctuates from one cycle to the
next. Alternatively one can sample the time for one cycle, that is to say the period

T, over many trials. In Fig. (6 ) I plot a histogram distribution of this period in 500
trials for three diﬀerent value of the noise level. The zero noise case gives a period of
6.35 which is the correct value for these parameters.
In this linearised noise treatment it remains the case that the energy on the limit
cycle does not change. However the work done by the escapement and hence the energy
lost to friction ﬂuctuates from one cycle of the escapement to the next. To see this
observe that it follows from the equations of motion that the work, W, done by the
escapement occurs at the rate K(x, y)y. Let one cycle of the clock start with a switch
7

from K = −µ to K = +µ. The the work done by the escapement over one cycle is
W = µr∗

(19)
where τ± is the time spent in the state K = ±µ. As these intervals are random
variables the work done in each cycle is a random variable. The heat dissipated on
each is given by cycle Q = W/Γ, so ﬂuctuations in W correspond to ﬂuctuations in
the heat dissipated. Putting it together, there is a relationship between ﬂuctuations
in the clock period and the ﬂuctuations in the heat dissipated by the clock.
In the deterministic case the work done averaged over each cycle is related to the
period by

A simple estimate of the average heat dissipated per cycle is

(21)
Including noise we expect both Q and T to ﬂuctuate from one cycle to the next.
In Fig.(7) I plot the result of 50 simulations for the work done on the ﬁrst half cycle
versus the corresponding period. The work done is computed numerically from the

parameters gives a slope of 0.078.

The ﬂuctuations in Q thus determine the ﬂuctuations in the period and thus the
quality of the clock. Noting that the ﬂuctuations in the period depend on the phase
diﬀusion noise and this scales inversely with the size of the limit cycle r∗, while the
average heat lost per cycle scales with the size of the limit cycle, the more accurate
8

the clock the greater is the heat dissipated. This important thermodynamic constraint
on the accuracy of clocks was ﬁrst presented by Erker at al. [11] in the context of an
abstract quantum model. We see here it is a consequence of the dissipative nature of
a simple classical periodic clock. It also follows that on the limit cycle Q/T = 4µr∗,
a constant on all cycles. This implies that the fractional error in heat dissipated and
clock frequency are related by
δQ
Q = δω
ω
(23)
A similar result occurs in the context of non periodic thermal clocks as I discuss in
section (4). In section (3) I will consider quantum periodic clocks. There the noise on
the limit cycle arises from a fundamental quantum sources of noise: spontaneous emis-
sion and quantum tunnelling. These processes do not go to zero at zero temperature
and thus quantum thermodynamics limits the accuracy of all clocks.
2.3.
Dissipation and noise in the quartz oscillator clock.
As a second example of a well known periodic clock I will consider the electronic
quartz oscillator clock. A shortcoming of the treatment of the escapement pendulum
clock in the previous section is the omission of the back-action of the pendulum on the
escapement: the kick function was simply imposed. The quartz oscillator clock gives an
opportunity to move beyond this. The two key discoveries that led to the quartz clock
are; the discovery of relaxation oscillations (another name for limit cycles) in vacuum
tube circuits and the high quality piezo-electric oscillations exhibited by small crystals
of quartz. A good summary of the history is given by the inventor, Warren Marrison
[12].
I will focus here on the relaxation oscillations exhibited in a feedback circuit to
form a Schmidtt trigger. A typical Schmidtt trigger has the circuit diagram shown in
Fig. 8(A). The Op Amp is conﬁgured as a comparator. The input voltage is applied

piezo electric oscillator coupled to an astable oscialltor
at the inverting input. The non inverting input voltage is determined by a voltage
divider comprised of resistors R1, R2. The initial output of the Op Amp, V0, is at the
saturation voltage Vs. The voltage at the + terminal is βVs where β = R1/(R1 + R2).
If the input voltage at the −terminal ramps up from a low value and exceeds βVs,
the output switches to −Vs. Now ramping the voltage at the −terminal back down,
the output will switch back to +Vs.
9

A phenomenological model for the Schmidtt trigger is given by the equation
˙V = γ(1 −g(V ))e−ηX −γ(1 + g(V ))eηX
(24)
where V is the output voltage and X is the applied voltage at the inverting termi-
nal. The exponential dependence on voltage, X, reﬂects an avalanche-like switching
between reverse and forward biased transistors inside the device. At steady state for
ﬁxed X, the system rapidly decays onto the steady state output voltage Vss as a
function of the input X given implicitly by
g(Vss) = −tanh(ηX)
(25)
Clearly |g(Vss)| ≤1. In the case of a Schmidtt trigger built from an OP Amp with
feed back as in Fig. (5A)
g(V ) = V + tanh βV
1 + V tanh βV
(26)
where β = AR2/(R1 + R2), and A is a parameter that determines the quality of the
Op. Amp. Typically A >> 1. This is equivalent to the model discussed in reference
[14].

When we include the quartz oscillator as shown in Fig. 8(B), the input voltage to
the Schmidtt trigger is the voltage on the equivalent capacitor of the quartz oscillator.

where V is the output voltage of the Schmidtt trigger, X is the voltage on the equiva-
lent circuit capacitor and Y is the ﬂux in the equivalent circuit inductor for the quartz
crystal and ω is the natural frequency of the equivalent LC circuit. The saturation volt-
age is set to unity. This is not a Hamiltonian system as there are only three equations.
This is justiﬁed by the large dissipative time constant for the Schmidtt trigger.
A typical limit cycle trajectory for V and X are shown in Fig, 10. The limit cycle
occurs via a Hopf bifurcation for values of χ above a critical value where the ﬁxed point
at the origin becomes unstable. Comparing this to the treatment of the escapement
clock in the previous section, it is easy to see how this system may be conﬁgured as a
clock by a simple mechanism to count the number of transitions of the output voltage
of the Op Amp.

On the limit cycle, g(V (t)) = −tanh(ηx(t)) from which it follows that V (t) =
−tanh(βV (t) + ηx(t)). Substituting into the equation of motion for Y ,

where the approximation becomes better in the limit that η >> β > 1 (noting that
|V (t)| ≤1). So this model reduces to the kick-function model discussed in the previous
section.
Noise enters this description in the form of Johnson-Nyquist noise in Ohmic re-
sistance. A phenomenlogical model of a Schmidtt trigger subject to thermal noise is
presented in [14]. In the model used here this corresponds to adding a ﬂuctuating
white noise term to the equation of motion for X,
˙Y = −ωX −κY + χV +
√
DdW(t)
(33)
where D is a thermal diﬀusion constant and dW(t) is the Wiener process. The analysis
proceeds much as in the previous example. After transients have died out the limit
cycle can be described by using the variables (r, ψ). Linearising the noise on the limit
cycle gives a constant phase diﬀusion. The implications for the accuracy of the clock
are unchanged: the more energy is dissipated, the better the clock.

Quantum Periodic clocks.
3.1.
Lasers.
In atomic clocks the primary oscillator is an electric dipole non linear oscillator between
a ground and excited state of an atom, although an ensemble of atoms is typically
used. If the energy diﬀerence between the ground and excited state is ϵ, the resonance
frequency of the atomic oscillator is ω = ϵ/ℏ. The driving system, playing the role of
the escapement in a mechanical clock, is a laser. The electric ﬁeld of the laser drives
the atomic dipole transition. The coupling between the laser and the atomic oscillator
can be made in various ways including a direct coupling or a feedback coupling; a
distinction that Levine[15] refers to as active versus passive respectively. In atomic
clocks both the drive oscillator and the atomic oscillator are nonlinear.
I will begin with the laser which, as Wiseman has cogently argued, is already a
clock[16], albeit at a very high frequency. It converts a continuous source of input
energy, the ‘pump’, into a coherent oscillation at a (almost) ﬁxed frequency provided
the pump power is above a critical threshold. There is an irreducible level of quantum
noise in the laser oscillator above threshold due to spontaneous emission.
The quantum theory of the laser is well established. Although there are a very large
variety of lasers I will adopt one model for deﬁniteness: an optical cavity containing
a large number of atoms with an atomic transition close to the cavity frequency. A
source of incoherent radiation, the ‘pump’, maintains a population inversion between
the ground and excited state of the transition (i.e. on average, more atoms are in the
excited state than the ground state).
In a competition between the incoherent pumping and loss due to spontaneous
and stimulated emission from the laser transition and the optical cavity, the electric
ﬁeld inside the cavity can reach a non equilibrium steady state. This steady state
can undergo a non equilibrium phase transition as the pumping is increased above
a threshold. Below the threshold the ﬁeld is Gaussian distributed with average ﬁeld
amplitude of zero. Above the threshold, the ﬁeld is non-Gaussian with a well deﬁned
intensity (Poisson distributed) and slowly diﬀusing phase with respect to the cavity
frequency. In a semi-classical approach this transition is described as ﬁxed point to
limit cycle bifurcation with added noise.
I will base my discussion on the case in which the cavity loss dominates over atomic
decay. In this case the gain medium can be adiabatically eliminated. A good discussion
can be found in [17] and I will follow that approach.
The quantum state of the intracavity ﬁeld can be written in the photon number
basis |n⟩. We deﬁne annihilation and creation operators a, a† by a|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩,
a†|n⟩= √n + 1|n + 1⟩. It then follows that a†a|n⟩= n|n⟩. We call a†a the photon
number operator.
In the laboratory frame the average cavity ﬁeld oscillates at the cavity frequency
ωc. The ﬁrst step is to move to the interaction picture at the cavity frequency which
removes the average ﬁeld oscillation altogether. In the interaction picture the quantum
state ρ of the intracavity laser ﬁeld at any time then satisﬁes the master equation,
˙ρ = GnsD[a†]

and G is the small signal gain, ns is the saturation photon number and κ is the cavity

e−β(a†a+ns)/2ρe−β(a†a+ns)/2

which describes the incoherent pumping process.
I have also assumed operation at optical frequencies to ignore thermal photons
entering the cavity. Any noise necessarily arises from quantum ﬂuctuations not thermal
ﬂuctuations. The ﬁrst term in Eq.(34) represents gain, that is to say, the injection of
energy into the cavity ﬁeld, while the second term represents photon loss through the
cavity mirrors.
The probability, pn(t), to ﬁnd n photons in the cavity at time t is given by pn(t) =
⟨n|ρ(t)|n⟩. It then follows from Eq. (34) that

The steady state solution is given by detailed balance[9] as

which is analogous to a thermal distribution with

(41)
Well above threshold G >> κ the steady state distribution is Poisson with mean
¯n = Gns/κ
(42)
This discussion does not make it particularly transparent why we should regard a
laser as a clock. Indeed the steady state has no dynamics at all. In order to resolve
this we need to study the dynamics of the laser subject to continuous observation. This
will be an important theme in my discussion of the thermodynamic limits to quantum
clocks.
13

First however I would like to introduce an equivalent classical model. This can be
found by computing the dynamics of the average ﬁeld α(t) = tr(aρ(t)). Substitut-
ing this into the master equation and factorising moments (equivalent to neglecting
quantum noise) the semiclassical dynamics is given by
˙α = −κα

(43)
Well above threshold this is similar to the van der Pol oscillator in a rotating frame.
There are two ﬁxed points α0 = 0 and |α0|2 = Gns/κ for G >> κ. The second solution
is the above threshold limit-cycle solution.
To make a start it is useful to ﬁnd the stationary two-time correlation function
g(1)(τ) = ⟨a†(t + τ)a(t)⟩ss
⟨a†a⟩ss
(44)
Wiseman shows[17] that, well above threshold, this is given by
g(1)(τ) = e−κτ/4¯n
(45)
We can interpret this result as due to quantum phase diﬀusion noise at the rate
Γ = κ/2¯n. Note that this residual phase diﬀusion occurs at zero temperature unlike
the classical case which goes to zero at zero temperature. It suggests an ineliminable
source of quantum noise for periodic clocks.
Wiseman[18] presented the theory of a laser subject to continuous heterodyne detec-
tion. In the appropriate limit this is a continuous measurement of the real component
of the electric ﬁeld in the cavity in a frame rotating at the cavity frequency. Measure-
ment changes the dynamics of the laser from the standard master equation given in
Eq.(34). The reason for this is that measurement provides information about the state
of the system and thus the conditional state of the system, conditioned on the mea-
surement result must be considered. In other words, quantum state reduction must be
modelled explicitly.
To motivate this, suppose that at t = 0, the state of the cavity ﬁeld was projected
by some hypothetical fast measurement into a coherent state |α⟩[19]. This is a state
of well deﬁned phase and amplitude. It is clearly not a steady state of the system.
How does it subsequently evolve according to Eq. (34)? Following Wiseman[18] we
can solve the master equation for a short time interval dt in the Fock basis to obtain
ρn,m(dt) = e−|α|2 αnα∗m
√
n!m!

1 −dt(n −m)2
2(n + m)

(46)
where ρn,m = ⟨n|ρ|m⟩. We ll above threshold we can replace n+m in the denominator
by 2¯n. This is the quantum analogue of linearising the noise on the classical limit
cycle. It then follows that the short time dynamics is equivalent to that given by the
master equation
˙ρ = ΓD[a†a]ρ
(47)
where Γ = κ/2¯n, the well know result for the line width of a laser. Eq. (47) is the
standard master equation description of phase diﬀusion. It ensures that the mean
14

photon number does not change while the mean amplitude decays at the rate Γ. This
corresponds to a state that is slowly diﬀusing in phase but all the while remaining of
ﬁxed intensity, completely analogous to phase difussion on a limit cycle in the classical
case.
In the case of continuous-time measurement we seek an equation that gives the
conditional state in an inﬁntesimal time interval dt conditioned on all previous mea-
surement results parameterised by time. This has come to be known as a quantum
trajectory[20]. The description has two components: a classical stochastic diﬀerential
equation to describe the ﬂuctuating classical measurement record and a stochastic
master equation to describe the corresponding change in the conditional state at each
time step.
In the case of optical heterodyne detection the classical stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tion describes a photo current record that results when the output of the laser cavity
is mixed with a strong coherent local oscillator, detuned from cavity frequency, and
then subject to photodetection[20]. This current, suitably normlised, is given by
Jhet(t)dt = κ⟨a(t)⟩cdt +
rκ
η dZ(t)
(48)
where 0 < η ≤1 is the photo-detector quantum eﬃciency, dZ(t) is a complex valued
Weiner process and ⟨a(t)⟩c is the usual trace average computed with respect to the
conditional state ρc(t) conditioned on the heterodyne current record to time t. This
obeys the conditional master equation
dρc = Lρcdt +
rη
κH[a]ρcdZ∗
(49)
where the quantum conditioning superoperator H[A] is deﬁned by
H[A]ρ = Aρ + ρA −tr[Aρ + ρA]ρ
(50)
and Lρ is the rest of the master equation given in Eq.(34). In essence this superoperator
partially ‘collapses’ the quantum state at each time step. Note that if the system is
in a coherent state, for which a|α⟩= α|α⟩at any time t, then the noise vanishes as
H[A]|α⟩⟨α| = 0. The conditional master equation tends to localise the conditional
states on coherent states. In other words the continuous monitoring of the complex
amplitude of the laser ﬁeld tends to drive the conditional states towards a coherent
state.
Well above threshold when operating on the classical limit cycle we may use the
phase diﬀusion master equation in Eq. (47) and describe the conditional state of the
system by
˙ρc = ΓD[a†a] + √ηH[a]ρcdW ∗
(51)
Writing ρc(t) as a mixture of coherent states as
ρc(t) =
Z
d2αPc(α, t)|α⟩⟨α|
(52)
and changing variables to α = reiφ Wiseman[18]shows that in the limit that η →1
15

the conditional phase dynamics well above threshold when the laser is operating on a
limit cycle is stochastic and determined by
dφc =
√
ΓdW
(53)
the standard phase diﬀusion model seen for a classical limit cycle in the presence of
thermal noise. Here however the noise is not thermal in origin but quantum, ulti-
mately due to spontaneous emission from the cavity in this model. The limit-cycle like
behaviour emerges only when we consider the conditional state of a laser when the
amplitude of the ﬁeld is continuously monitored.
The frequency of the ﬁeld on the limit cycle in the original laboratory frame is close
to the optical frequency of the cavity. This is very high which makes it impossible to
count directly via standard electronic measures. Figuring out ways to do this is the
core of atomic clock technology. A ﬁrst step can be made by including a non linear
optical process into the laser cavity. In real optical clocks this is done by using a
multi mode treatment to include many longitudinal cavity modes and incorporating
an optical non linear process to couple them thus producing a mode locked laser. In
the single mode model presented here it suﬃces to include a single mode optical non
linearity such as an atomic absorber or a Kerr non linearity. I will adopt the latter
approach.
3.2.
Self-Modulated laser clocks
A Kerr optical non linearity is a material with an intensity dependent refractive index.
In a single mode model this would induce a time dependent detuning that depended
on the number of photons in the cavity. With this in mind consider Eq.(34) changed
to
˙ρ = −iϵ[a+a†, ρ]−iδ[a†a, ρ]−iχ[a†2a2, ρ]+GnsD[a†]

A[a†] + ns

where ϵ is the amplitude of a small noisy injected signal at a carrier frequency δ
detuned from the cavity frequency. The nonlinearity is paramterised by χ in units of
frequency. The corresponding semiclassical equation is
˙α
=
−iϵ −i(δ + 2χ|α|2)α

The inclusion of a small driving term ϵ is important: without it the solutions to the
semiclassical equations remain on the unstable ﬁxed point at the origin in the classical
limit without noise. It need only be a complex valued Gaussian noise process with
zero mean. It is unnecessary to include this in the full quantum model as quantum
ﬂuctuations suﬃce to drive the system. The second term contains the intensity depen-
dent detuning arising from the Kerr non linearity. In Fig. (11) I plot some examples of
the self-pulsing limit cycle that develops from the original above-threshold laser limit
cycle.
A good estimate of the frequency of these oscillations can be found by linearising
the dynamics on the limit cycle. Using α = reiθ we ﬁnd that the frequency on the
limit cycle (for δ = 0) is given by Ω= χ¯n. The model so far is entirely deterministic

and does not include the phase diﬀusion noise characteristic of a laser operating above
threshold. A simple way to do this is to add the required phase diﬀusion noise for an
above threshold laser to the semi classical phase equation to get the Ito equation (with
δ = 0)
dθ = −Ωdt +
√
ΓdW
(56)
where Ω= χ¯n and Γ = κ/2¯n. For ¯n >> 1, the frequency becomes large and the noise
becomes small. As previously we deﬁne the (dimensionless) energy as E = r2. On the
limit cycle the energy is E∗= ¯n. The rate of change of energy is then given by
˙E = −κE + Gns = −κE + κ¯n
(57)
for G >> κ. The ﬁrst term represents the rate of energy lost to the cavity via photon
emission while the second term is the rate of energy gain due to the pumping mech-
anism. The limit cycle forms when these two terms cancel. For a good clock we need
the rate of phase diﬀusion to be small which requires ¯n >> 1 in which case the energy
dissipation is large: a good clock requires a large rate of energy dissipation.
3.3.
A quantum nano mechanical clock.
In [21] Park et al. demonstrated a nanomechanical oscillator driven by an electron
tunnelling current. This system is an example of a periodic clock driven by a quantum
noise process as I now show. In the experiment a single C60 molecule was loosely bound
by van der Waals forces between two gold electrodes. The frequency of the mechanical
oscillation was 1.2THz. The mechanical motion can be approximated by a harmonic
oscillator. An experimental implementation of a nanomechanical clock was recently
reported by Pearson et al.[22]
Single electrons tunnel on and oﬀthe molecule due to a tunnel coupling between a
single quasi bound state on the molecule and fermionic reservoirs in the gold electrodes.
These reservoirs are biased by a source-drain voltage and thus each is only in local
thermodynamic equilibrium with a diﬀerence in their chemical potentials determined
by the source-drain voltage. The molecule functions as a single electron quantum dot.
When an electron tunnels onto the molecule it experiences an electric ﬁeld that pushes
it from the source to the drain whereupon the electron tunnels oﬀthe dot into the
drain and the van der Waals potential provides a restoring force. In the right regime
the molecule shuttles backwards and forwards on a limit cycle between the source and
the drain electrode. The nonlinearity responsible for the limit cycle is the exponential
dependence of the tunnelling rate on the displacement of the molecule from eqilibrium.

A schematic representation of a single harmonically bound quantum dot between two electrodes.
Electrons tunnel onto the dot from the left and oﬀthe dot to the right. The bare tunnelling rates ]γL, γR are
exponentially modulated by the displacement of the dot from equilibrium.
A schematic diagram of this is shown in Fig.(12).
In [23] a master equation treatment is presented and I will summarise that here.
I will assume the so-called ‘zero temperature” limit in which, under appropriate bias
conditions and very low temperature, the Fermi factor on the left is unity and the
Fermi factor on the right is zero. Furthermore I will assume the bias conditions are
such that the quasi bound electronic state on the molecule has an energy well below
the Fermi level in the source and well above the Fermi level in the drain. This ensures
that low temperature ﬂuctuations in the occupation close to the Fermi levels are not
important.
When electrons tunnel out of the source and onto the drain the external circuit
increments/decrements the charge in the source/drain to ensure that they each remain
in local thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e. keep a constant chemical potential. This links
fundamental quantum discrete tunnelling events to ﬂuctuations of the current and
voltages in the external circuit.
The dynamical variables are the mean number of electrons on the molecule ¯n and the
mean displacement X and mean conjugate momentum P of the oscillator. The semi-
classcial equations are obtained by calculating the equations of motion for these ﬁrst
order moments, using the master equation, and factorising all higher order moments;

which undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with increasing χ to a limit cycle forming the
clock. The details can be found in [23]. Note the similarity between these equations
and the equations of motion for the quartz oscillator coupled to a Schmidtt trigger
given in Eq. (28) with g(V ) = 2V −1. A typical limit cycle is shown in Fig.(13).

current through the system, 2I(T)/e. Parameters are γL = γR == 0.1, ν = 1.0, η = 1.0, χ = 1.0, κ = 0.1.
A statistical description of the semiclassical dynamics can also be obtained from the
master equation. The telegraph signal is determined by two point processes dNL(t)
and dNR(t). When an electron tunnels onto the molecule in a time dt, dNL(t) = 1.
Like wise when an electron on the molecule tunnels oﬀin a time dt, dNR(t) = 1. The
master equation determines the average values of these point processes in terms of
quantum averages;
E[dNL(t)]

γL⟨e−4η ˆ
X(ˆn −1)⟩dt
(62)
E[dNR(t)]
=
γR⟨e4η ˆ
X ˆn⟩dt
(63)
where ˆX is the displacement operator for the mechanical motion and ˆn is the number
operator for the number of excess electrons on the molecule. Correlations (entangle-
ment) between the electronic and motional states means these moments do not fac-
torise in general. The conditions for which factorisation is a good approximation (see
[23]) deﬁne the semiclassical approximation. In that case the two Poisson processes
become inhomogeneous point processes and the occupation probabilities obey
˙p1(t) = γLp0(t)e−4ηX(t) −γRp1(t)e4ηX(t)
(64)
The important point is that, unlike the apparently similar Quartz model Eq.(28), the
noise in this case is not thermal diﬀusion in momentum but rather intrinsic quantum
ﬂuctuations arising from single electron tunnelling events. Nonetheless I will show that
the limit for a good clock requires a large amount of energy dissipation.
What is the clock signal? To answer that question we need to understand how
the fundamental quantum tunnelling events are related to the current in the external
circuit. These tunnelling events deﬁne conditional Poisson stochastic process dNL(T)
and dNR(t) for left and right tunnelling events that take the values 0, 1 in an increment
of time dt, where 1 corresponds to a single tunnelling event. The rates for these process
are conditioned by quantum averages. In a completely symmetric tunnelling scheme,
γL = γR = γ, the average current is given by the classical stochastic process
I(t)dt = e
2 (dNL(t) + dNR(t))
(65)
19

It follows that in the semiclassical limit the average current is given by
¯I(t) = eγ

 e−4ηX(n −1) + e4ηXn

(66)
An example is given in Fig(13).
The quantum dynamics is given by solving the master equation given in [23]. If no
attempt is made to monitor the current, the dynamics is given by the unconditional
master equation. A typical example is shown in Fig.(14).
Figure 14.

On the other hand if tunelling events are monitored using the current through the
molecule, the dynamics is given by a conditional master equation. A typical example
is shown in Fig.(15). The ﬂuctuations in the clock period arising from the stochastic

nature of quantum tunnelling events is now evident. This leads to phase and amplitude
ﬂuctuations in the dynamics of the mechanical oscillations limiting the accuracy of the
clock.
On the limit cycle we deﬁne X(t) = r∗sin(Ωt), Y (t) = r∗cos(Ωt) where r∗is the
amplitude of the limit cycle and Ωis the frequency. Using the same two-time averaging
procedure that I used in section (2.2), to a good approximation r∗is given by the
solution to the transcendental equation
eµx2 = cosh x
(67)
where x = ηr∗and µ = κπ/(4ηχ). The frequency is well approximated by ν with small
corrections of order ν−2.

The regularity of the clock can be seen in the time derivative of the integrated count
NR(t) for the process dNR(t). This is shown in Fig.(16) for various values of r∗. In (A)
the pure Poisson process with rate γ is shown. This corresponds to r∗= 0. As the size
of the limit cycle increases the process becomes more regular. Similar results hold for
Pr(n(t) = 0|n(0) = 0). This means that in the limit of large limit cycles, the period
of the conditional motion becomes increasingly regular and a good clock results.

The thermodynamic constraints on this system are similar to the quartz clock with
the important exception that here ﬂuctuations are due entirely to quantum tunneling
not thermal eﬀects. As before the size of the limit cycle determines both the average
energy dissipated and the quality of the clock. The semiclassical equations imply that
the rate of change of the energy of the oscillator (in dimensionless units), E = (X2 +
Y 2)/2 is
˙E = −κE(t) + χY (t)n(t)
(71)
The ﬁrst term on the right is energy lost due to damping into mechanical environment,
this time at (near) zero temperature, while the second term is the electrical work done
by the electrical ﬁeld when the dot is occupied. The argument runs through in a
21

similar fashion to the case in section 2.2. In the limit of large limit cycle amplitude,
r∗large, the work done over one cycle, starting at the the time (n(0) = 1), is given by
the integral of Y (t) over a single cycle which ends when the electron tunnels oﬀthe
molecule at a time t↓Ω= π The work done on the k′ th cycle is just the integral
Wk = χr∗
Z t↓

dt sin(Ωt) = 2χr∗Tk

(72)
where Tk = t↓and r∗is the radius of the limit cycle. Again this is in dimensionless
units; to convert to SI units, multiply by ℏν. As the work done on this cycle equals
the energy lost due to damping Qk we ﬁnd that
Qk = 2χr∗Tk
πκ
(73)
On average the energy dissipated depends on the average time the single electron
occupies the molecule. Thus over a long time τ, the average energy dissipated is de-
termined by the average fraction of time the dot is occupied. Using standard results
for a random telegraph signal we see that
¯Q = 2χr∗τ
πκ

γL

(74)
This quantity is dimensionless (to convert to SI units multiply by ℏν). This example
shows that, even at zero temperature, quantum ﬂuctuations ensure that a good clock
requires a large limit cycle r∗and this corresponds to large energy dissipation in the
molecular motion.
There is one ﬁnal thermodynamic lesson to take away from this example. The system
is ultimately driven by the diﬀerent chemical potentials in the Fermi reservoirs in the
source and drain. The average energy that must be dissipated in the external circuit
is given by eVSD(µL −µR) where e is the electronic charge, VSD is the source drain
bias voltage and µL/R are the chemical potentials in the left and right reservoirs. That
the chemical potentials are the not the same of course indicates that the entire system
is not in thermal equilibrium; the essential requirement for a clock to operate. The
free energy has been increased by electrical work done on it by the external circuit.
Erker et al.[11] give an interesting example in which a clock is driven by a diﬀerence in
temperature (the other Lagrange multiplier) between two reservoirs. There is another
very important class of clock that is driven by a diﬀerence in chemical potential; the
chemical clocks that characterise biological systems. Perceived time is determined by
the irreversible processes in such clocks [24].
4.
Non periodic clocks: information as fuel.
At ﬁrst sight the notion of a non periodic, irreversible clock seems paradoxical: a
clock is the very epitome of a deterministic periodic system. Yet irreversible clocks
have long been used, water clocks for example, and a particular irreversible clock
is in common usage. Radiocarbon dating is based on the stochastic and irreversible
decay of a radionuclide—C14. Metabolism ensures living organisms will continually
refresh their concentration of C14 while alive, but once dead the concentration begins
22

to relax to the steady state non-organic concentration of C14 in the environment.
Indeed, in radiocarbon dating one must take into account that diﬀerent organisms die
with diﬀering concentrations of C14. Furthermore, the vital concentration may change
with time due to concentration of C14 in the atmosphere changing over time. In other
words, diﬀerent organisms and diﬀerent epochs do not necessarily begin with the same
non equilibrium distribution. As we will see, relaxation from a non equilibrium state
is a key feature of non deterministic clocks, especially when the non equilibrium state
is a result of state conditioning of a system subject to measurement.
4.1.
Radio carbon clock.
It is known that the probability of a single radionuclide not to decay in a time t
is exp(−γt), where γ is called the decay rate. Given an ensemble of undecayed ra-
dionuclides, the number that have decayed after some time t is a Poisson distributed
stochastic variable N with mean γt. Thus, given a count of the number of radionuclides
that have decayed, N, we may estimate the time that has elapsed as

Conveniently, we get a better estimate the longer we wait. Now, in the case of radio-
carbon dating, one indeed wishes to compute the elapsed time test., and so one requires
to know γ before hand; calibrate the clock. However, conversely, one could instead take
this system as deﬁning a temporal scale, where to take the time would be to make the
count N, and the value of γ would merely reﬂect a particular choice of units and thus
be purely conventional. That is, the actual count N, while subject to ﬂuctuations, is
a local physical quantity that can serve as physical time. Yet it is worth noting that a
radionuclide can only decay, i.e., N can only increase, so in contrast to the prototypical
reversible clock, this is a clock with no tock.

Mach’s thermal clock
Mach’s thermal clock was an attempt to ground an understanding of time in our sense
perception of irreversible processes [30]. Mach’s clock is a thermodynamic system in
which three identical materials, initially held at diﬀerent temperatures, are placed in
thermal contact but thermally isolated from the rest of the universe, see Fig.(17).
As the system is isolated, the internal energy, U cannot change with time, thus
˙U = c( ˙T1 + ˙T2 + ˙T3) = 0
(77)
where c is the speciﬁc heat. Thus T1(t) + T2(t) + T3(t) = T1(0) + T2(0) + T3(0), a
constant. Newton’s law of cooling, is an empirical law that says the rate of change

of temperature is proportional to the temperature diﬀerence. It is used by forensic
pathologists. In this case it implies that
˙T1 = k(T3 −T1) + k(T2 −T1)
(78)
which is clearly negative and k is a constant. Using similar relations for the other
temperatures we ﬁnd that
¯T −T1(τ) = Ae−3kτ
(79)
where A = ¯T −T1(0) is a constant and we have deﬁned the initial average temperature
as ¯T = (T1(0) + T2(0) + T3(0))/3. This is very like radioactive decay. Given a good
thermometer, it is possible to estimate the time and conversely. Eq. (79) implies that
the uncertainties satisfy

where I have deﬁned an estimated time by τest = 1/3k in analogy with radioactive

Quantum thermal clocks.
A simple generalisation that introduces temperature in a fundamental way results if
we consider a two-level system (TLS) in a thermal bath at temperature T (radiative
damping). While the ensemble average is a stationary state in equilibrium with the
bath, continuous measurement of the energy of a single realisation (discussed in more
detail below) yields a random telegraph signal. Let us deﬁne the random telegraph
signal Z(t) to take the value Z(t) = −1 if the two-level system is found in the ground
state |g⟩and Z(t) = 1 if it is found in the excited state |e⟩. The conditional state at
time t, given the measurement record up to that time, is then
ρcond.(t) = 1 + Z(t)
2
|e⟩⟨e| + 1 −Z(t)
2
|g⟩⟨g|.
(81)
24

On the other hand, the ensemble average—the average over all possible random tele-
graph signals—yields the thermal state
ρth.(β) = 1 −tanh(βϵ/2)
2
|e⟩⟨e| + 1 + tanh(βϵ/2)
2
|g⟩⟨g|
(82)
where β = 1/kBT with T the temperature of the bath, kB is Boltzmann’s constant and
ϵ is the energy separation between |g⟩and |e⟩. (The convention is |g⟩is assigned energy
−ϵ/2 and |e⟩is assigned energy ϵ/2.) The transition rate from |e⟩to |g⟩is γ(¯n + 1)
and that from |g⟩to |e⟩is γ¯n where ¯n = [exp(βϵ) −1]−1 is the bath occupation and γ
is the spontaneous emission rate. At temperatures and energies such that ¯n >> 1 we
can neglect spontaneous emission and these rates are the same.
A simple irreversible clock can now be deﬁned operationally by counting the number
of transitions N. As before, N is a Poisson distributed stochastic variable, but this time
with parameter γ¯n, which depends on temperature. In the high-temperature limit, the
equivalent to Eq. (75) reads
test. = N
γ¯n ≈
ϵN
γkBT .
(83)
The error in the estimate scales as (γ¯n)−1/2 which is the rate at which energy is
dissipated. As is the case for periodic clocks, the greater the rate of energy dissipated
the better the clock. This is the key result of Erker et al. [11].
In contrast to the example from radiocarbon dating, here the relative error in test. is
limited by the relative error in the temperature, T. That is, in order for this system to
deﬁne an accurate temporal scale, we require a good thermometer. Conversely, we may
use this system as a thermometer where the temperature is estimated from elapsed
time,
kBTest. = ϵN
γt ,
(84)
so one may equally well say that in order for this system to deﬁne an accurate tem-
perature scale, we require a good clock. For a ﬁxed count N, and a given two-level
system, we see that for high temperature,
test.Test = constant
(85)
which implies that

+ δTest.

= 0.
(86)
This is the same structure that was derived for the Mach clock in Eq. (80) and suggests
a special relationship between time and temperature that I will return to in section
sections (5.1,5.2). An elegant treatment of the statistical connection between time
and temperature has recently been given by Tanaka[26] using the Fisher information
metric associated with estimation of time and temperature.
There is a hidden assumption in this treatment: I have assumed that one can indeed
monitor the state of a single TLS and thus accurately sample the random telegraph
process Z(t). In this assumption I have in eﬀect smuggled in a very low entropy bath
25

to ensure the measurements do indeed provide reliable information on the state of the
TLS. In this type of clock, the conditional state of the system is pushed away from
thermal equilibrium, and the free energy raised, not by doing work but by extracting
entropy through good measurements. In this sense, information is fuel.
4.4.
A superconducting quantum thermal clock.
It is not easy to make detectors that count individual quantum jumps of a quantum
system but it is a standard measurement for a TLS based on superconducting quantum
circuits [27]. These are devices based on the Josephson eﬀect in superconductors at
very low temperatures. A typical such device is known as a transmon[28] depicted in
a highly simpliﬁed schematic form in Fig.(18).
Figure 18.

a schematic representation of the device. Reproduced with permission from Koch et al Phys. Rev. A 76,

A small metal superconducting island is separated from a reservoir of Cooper pairs
by tunnelling junctions. Cooper pairs can tunnel on and oﬀthe island though the
Josephson eﬀect. Furthermore a hole is introduced into the junction forming a ‘split
junction’. By changing the magnetic ﬂux through this hole, the coupling energy be-
tween the transmon and the reservoir can be changed, eﬀectively changing the rate
of the tunnelling. In addition, the island can be capacitively coupled to a neighbour-
ing superconducting bias line enabling the Coulomb energy of the transmon to be
changed. Thus there are two ‘handles’ for changing the energy of the transmon. By
carefully adjusting the ratio of the capacitive coupling to the tunnel coupling a dis-
crete energy spectrum results. These levels are not equally spaced enabling a microwave
voltage source on the capacitive coupling to be resonant only with transitions from
the ground state to the ﬁrst excited state. This is the two-level system of interest.
The microwave voltage is sustained in driven superconducting cavity containing the
transmon. Eﬀectively this constitutes a simple TLS in an electromagnetic cavity that
may be thermally or coherently driven, or both.
26

We now require a way to measure the state of the TLS. This is based on the
method of dispersive coupling [29]. The transmon can be simultaneously coupled to a
second cavity with a resonant frequency that is well-detuned from the TLS transition
frequency. In this case transitions between the energy eigenstates of the TLS are
suppressed but the cavity frequency can be shifted by diﬀerent amounts depending on
the state of the TLS. This is a non linear dispersion. Reciprocally, the energy diﬀerence
between the states of the TLS are shifted by an amount proportional to the intensity of
the ﬁeld in the cavity. In atomic physics this is known as the dynamic Stark eﬀect. We
will refer to this dispersively coupled cavity as the readout cavity. For a more detailed
discussion see section 3.10.2 of [20]
If the readout cavity is thermally isolated and coherently (but weakly) driven, the
steady state ﬁeld inside the cavity is in a coherent state: a pure state of zero entropy.
The amplitude of this state depends on the detuning of the driving ﬁeld from the
readout cavity resonance frequency. But as this resonance frequency is shifted by the
TLS, the phase of the ﬁeld emerging from the cavity will change depending on the
state of the TLS. If this phase is continuously monitored using homodyne detection,
a continuous measurement record of the changing state of the TLS can be inferred
under the right conditions. One of these conditions is that the readout cavity must be
subject to very little thermal excitation so that it remains close to a coherent state.
This amounts to assuming that the readout system has very low entropy thus making
explicit the necessity for another very low temperature heat bath for the thermal clock
to function.
To implement a thermal clock with this system, the TLS must be coupled to a
thermal radiation ﬁeld. This can be simulated by driving the TLS with an additional
Gaussian noise ﬁeld at the TLS resonance to implement controllable thermal noise
acting on the transmon. A schematic of this temperature clock is given in Fig.(19).

coupled to a coplanar waveguide cavity on a chip. A coherent microwave ﬁeld is transmitted through the
cavity and detected via homodyne mixing producing a signal that monitors the state of the TLS in real time.
To produce a non periodic thermal clock the TLS is driven by high-temperature (T) noise, generated by an
arbitrary wave generator and up-converted to the TLS frequency with the help of an external microwave source
[Figure courtesy of Arkady Fedorov].
The joint quantum state of the resonator and the readout qubit satisﬁes the master
equation

=
−iE[a + a†, ρ] −iχ[a†aσz, ρ]
+γ( ¯N + 1)D[σ−]ρ + γ ¯ND[σ+] + κD[a]ρ,
where E is the amplitude of the coherent driving ﬁeld driving the measurement cavity,
χ is the strength of the dispersive coupling between TLS and cavity, κ, γ are the energy
decay rates of the readout cavity and TLS respectively, and ¯N is the mean excitation
in thermal radiation coupled to the TLS. The ﬁnal four terms describe irreversible
27

evolution. The superoperator appearing in these terms is deﬁned, as previously, by
D[A]ρ = AρA† −1
2A†Aρ −1
2ρA†A.
Note that the coupling of the TLS to the cavity is proportional to the energy of the
TLS which ensures that this coupling, of itself, cannot change the energy distribution
of the TLS but it does change the detuning of the measurement cavity, conditional
on the state of the TLS, and thus changes the amplitude of the ﬁeld emitted. The
homodyne current (scaled by γ) of the emitted ﬁeld is given by
I(t) = ⟨a + a†⟩c + ξ(t)/√γη
(87)
where ξ(t) is a white noise process, 0 < η < 1 is the homodyne detection eﬃciency, γ
is the TLS energy decay rate. This classical stochastic process will be used to monitor
the quantum jumps of the TLS and thus constitutes the counter for the thermal clock.
While the current I(t) is a classical stochastic process it’s statistics is conditioned on
the quantum source; thus the subscript on the quantum average in the ﬁrst term. The
conditional state, conditioned on a particular current history can be computed using
the method of quantum trajectories[20]. In eﬀect this describes a continuous stochastic
state reduction up to time t. This state obeys the stochastic master equation [20]
dρc
=
−iE[a + a†, ρc] −iχ[a†aσz, ρc]
+γ( ¯N + 1)D[σ−]ρc + γ ¯ND[σ+]ρc + κD[a]ρc + √κηH[a]ρcdW(t),
where dW(t) is a classical Wiener process and H[A]ρ = Aρ + ρA† −tr(Aρ + ρA†).
To operate as a pure entropy clock, it is necessary to distinguish quantum jumps
in the TLS due to thermal excitations. To this end we will assume that the readout
cavity is strongly driven and rapidly damped. In this limit the state of the TLS obeys
the eﬀective master equation in the Schr¨odinger picture,
˙ρ = −i(∆+ ϵ/ℏ)[σz, ρ] + γ( ¯N + 1)D[σ−]ρ + γ ¯ND[σ−]ρ + ΓD[σz]ρ,
(88)
where ∆= 4χE2/κ2 and Γ = 4∆χ/κ. The last term in the master equation leads
to pure phase-diﬀusion around the z-axis on the Bloch sphere and decay of the TLS
polarisation but cannot change the steady-state of the TLS which remains thermal. It
also describes a continuous measurement of σz as I now explain.
The observed record is the homodyne stochastic photocurrent exiting the readout
cavity of the qubit that now becomes
I(t)dt = ⟨σz⟩cdt + dW(t)/
p
ηΓ,
(89)
The conditional stochastic master equation now takes the form

+ΓD[σz]ρcdt +

The condition to see quantum jumps is Γ >> γ ¯N which ensures that information
about the energy of the TLS is acquired faster than it is changed by thermal transitions.
In Fig.(20) I plot the conditional mean of σz showing quantum jumps. In this limit
the system is operating as a thermal clock driven by reductions in entropy due to
the measurement. In other words, when the rate of information gain by an observer

limit the free energy of the clock is increased by entropy reduction rather than work
done as in the typical periodic clock.

Fundamental questions relating to clocks and thermodynamics.
An understanding of the thermodynamics of clocks suggest novel responses to deep
questions in fundamental physics and philosophy. Mach[30] (see Fig (17)) and also
Eddington[31] introduced the idea of a thermal or entropy clock to probe the question
of the arrow of time. Eddington introduced the idea of an entropy clock in an attempt
to penetrate the mystery of perceived time. As he put it [31]
It seems to me, therefore, that consciousness with its insistence on time’s arrow and
its rather erratic ideas of time measurement may be guided by entropy-clocks in some
portion of the brain. [. . . ] Entropy-gradient is then the direct equivalent of the time
of consciousness in both its aspects. Duration measured by physical clocks (time-like
interval) is only remotely connected.
I think you might agree, having read this far, that his conclusion is misguided: all
physical clocks are necessarily irreversible. In this sense all clocks are entropy clocks.
The link to consciousness is a more interesting speculation.
Our understanding of time has been enriched by the General Theory of Relativity
but Eddington’s comment seems to suggest that the time of GR is somehow diﬀerent
to the kind of thing measured by the clocks I have discussed in this paper. This is
certainly not the case. The Tolman relations in gravitational thermodynamics points
to a deep connection between the time of GR and the thermodynamics of clocks
by showing a duality between proper time and temperature. In seeking a quantum
theory of gravity the problem of time has led Rovelli[33] to propose the ‘thermal time
hypothesis’. Thermal clocks give operational signiﬁcance to this. In the remainder of
this paper I will comment on these issues in the light of a deeper understanding of the
thermodynamics of clocks.
29

5.1.
General relativity and Tolman relations.
In his book Relativity, Thermodynamics and Cosmology [32] Tolman applied the theory
of general relativity to thermodynamical systems. The most signiﬁcant result from the
perspective of this paper is that for a gas in thermal equilibrium and gravitational
equilibrium the temperature cannot be uniform and must vary from place to place
according to the metric of the relevant space time.
Before presenting the general relativistic case I will begin with the special relativistic
case. Consider an observer at rest with respect to a two-level system operating as a
thermal clock (see section 4.3 ) in contact with a heat bath with a temperature T0
with respect to that observer. In this case the relation between the estimated elapsed
proper time τ and T0 was seen to be T0τ = constant. (Eq.(85). For an observer
in uniform relative motion at relative velocity v, the elapsed time is dilated to be
t′ = τ/
p
1 −v2/c2. Given that the physics of the clock and its interaction with the
heat bath are unchanged, we see that for the moving observer the temperature will
be estimated to be T ′ = T0
p
1 −v2/c2; the correct transformation of temperature in
special relativity ( see section 69 of [32]).
Tolman developed a general covariant deﬁnition of thermal equilibrium along quite
general lines in [32]. I will summarise this result here in Tolman’s notation for the case
of a sphere of gas held together by gravitational forces and in thermal equilibrium. In
this case the general invariant interval can be written as
ds2 = −eµ(dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2 θdφ2) + eνdt2
(90)
where r, θ, φ are standard spherical polar coordinates and µ = µ(r), ν = ν(r). In this
case Tolman’s condition for thermal equilibrium reduces to

at all values r inside the sphere and where T0(r) is the proper temperature in a thin
spherical shell at radius r, while ρ00 and p0 are the mass density and pressure in that
shell. Integrating this equation

(93)
where g44 = eν is the temporal component of the metric. The same result holds for
the case of a sphere of pure black-body radiation. The result Eq.(93) also follows by
using a two-level thermal clock to measure proper time at radius r, in thermal contact
with the local environment at temperature T0 (section (4.3)).
5.2.
Rovelli’s thermal time hypothesis.
The variable t that appears in the theory of general relativity, like the other coor-
dinates, is arbitrary yet when a physical clock is localised at a space time point it
30

should count events in accordance with this coordinate. That does seem to make the t
coordinate special. How do we identify such systems? Rovelli[33, 34] has proposed the
‘thermal time hypothesis’ to address this question. The essential idea is a link between
a local statistical state and a dynamical ﬂow on physical quantities. This breaks the
relationship between the space time metric and temporality and thus looks promising
for a concept of time in quantum gravity. The thermodynamics of the machines we
call clocks gives a concrete manifestation of this idea.
As discussed in this paper, periodic clocks are driven, non equilibrium dissipative
systems. Non periodic clocks (thermal clocks) are systems driven from thermal equilib-
rium by measurement induced entropy reduction. In both cases they require a source
of free energy to operate; work in the case of periodic clocks and accurate measurement
in the case of non periodic clocks. All clocks are irreversible systems.
In the case of thermal clocks the steady state of the unconditional (non measured)
dynamics is given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution
ρβ = Z−1e−β ˆH
(94)
where β = 1/kBT and ˆH is the Hamiltonian operator. ( I will assume quantum physics
here). Proceeding formally for now, take the log of ρ as a deﬁnition of the Hamiltonian
up to a multiplicative factor
β ˆH = ln(ρβ)
(95)
The thermal ﬂow of an observable represented by a hermitian operator ˆA deﬁned by
αρ
τ( ˆA) satisﬁes
dαρ
τ( ˆA)
dτ
= −i
ℏ[log ρ, ˆA]
(96)
The thermal time of an equilibrium state τ at temperature T and the Schroedinger
quantum mechanical time t are related by
d
dτ = β d
dt
(97)
Rovelli and Smerlak [34] interpret β as the “speed” of thermal time; a rather novel
reinterpretation of temperature.
We can obtain a similar result by assuming that the history of thermal jumps tn
in the thermal clock index the state of every other local system, In other words the
state of a system is parameterised in terms of the stochastic process ρS(tn). One way
to think of this is that we only ever measure the system state at the times tn. In [35]
I showed how this kind of stochastic time can be formulated as a dynamical ﬂow in
terms of local lab time. If we average over the stochastic history of times, the dynamics
can be written in Schroedinger mechanical time as
dρs
dt = γ¯n
 
exp
"
−i
ˆHs
ℏγ¯n
#
ρs exp
"
i
ˆHs
ℏγ¯n
#
−ρs
!
(98)
At high temperatures ¯n = (βϵ)−1 where ϵ is the energy diﬀerence between the two
31

states of the thermal clock. We then ﬁnd that in the limit γ →∞, the good clock
limit, the dynamics may be approximated by
dρs
dτ = −i
ℏ[ln ρs,β, ρs]
(99)
where ρs,β is the steady state of the system itself at thermal equilibrium with the
same environment as that of the clock. This is analogous to Rovelli’s thermal time
ﬂow diﬀerential map. It must be admitted however that the ﬁrst order corrections to
this equation in γ−1 lead to intrinsic decoherence in all quantum dynamics[35].
Rovelli actually makes a more general hypothesis: any stationary state ρ can be
used to deﬁne a temporal ﬂow. I expect that this corresponds to the more general case
of irreversible periodic clocks. It is interesting to note that the stationary solutions of
Eq.(98) are diagonal in the eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. This would justify
applying the thermal time hypothesis in the more general form.
6.
Conclusion.
All physical clocks are open non equilibrium systems constrained by thermodynamics
and necessarily irreversible. All clocks are physical systems pushed away from thermal
equilibrium thereby increasing their free energy. In the case of periodic clocks this is
achieved by an external mechanism doing work on the system, for example a battery.
In the case of non periodic ‘thermal clocks’ it is achieved by decreasing entropy through
thermal or chemical potential gradients or, more interestingly, through measurement.
As dissipative systems, all clocks are subject to noise which limits their performance.
For classical clocks the source of noise is thermal and goes to zero with temperature.
Thermal noise leads to phase diﬀusion when clocks are running on large amplitude limit
cycles. In the case of quantum clocks noise remains even at zero temperature due to, for
example, spontaneous emission or quantum tunnelling. By using a range of examples
both classical and quantum I have shown that the thermodynamic constraints require
good clocks to dissipate large amounts of energy.
An understanding of the thermodynamic limits of clocks gives important insights
into the nature of physical time. I have shown how, for example, thermal clocks can
be used to give a physical realisation of Rovelli’s thermal time hypothesis.

we will be led to novel kinds of clocks that exceed the already incredible performance
of current atomic clocks.
