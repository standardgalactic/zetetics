Abstract
We release a corpus of 43 million atomic ed-
its across 8 languages. These edits are mined
from Wikipedia edit history and consist of in-
stances in which a human editor has inserted a
single contiguous phrase into, or deleted a sin-
gle contiguous phrase from, an existing sen-
tence. We use the collected data to show that
the language generated during editing differs
from the language that we observe in standard
corpora, and that models trained on edits en-
code different aspects of semantics and dis-
course than models trained on raw, unstruc-
tured text. We release the full corpus as a re-
source to aid ongoing research in semantics,
discourse, and representation learning.

Introduction
Written language often undergoes several rounds
of revision as human authors determine exactly
what information they want their words to convey.
On Wikipedia, this process is carried out collec-
tively by a large community at a rate of nearly two
revisions per second (Yang et al., 2017). While
Wikipedia’s revision history contains arbitrarily
complex edits, our corpus and analysis focuses on
atomic insertion edits: instances in which an ed-
itor has inserted a single, contiguous span of text
into an existing complete sentence (Table 1). This
restriction allows us to make several assumptions
which we believe make the data an especially pow-
erful source of signal. Namely, we can assume that
1) some information was not communicated by
the original sentence, 2) that information should
have been communicated (according to a human
editor), and 3) that information is communicated
by the inserted phrase. Thus, we believe that a
large data set of such edits is inherently valuable
for researchers modeling inference and discourse

and that the data can yield insights about represen-
tation at both the phrase and the sentence level.
We mine Wikipedia edit history to create a cor-
pus of 43 million atomic insertion and deletion ed-
its covering 8 languages. We argue that the cor-
pus contains distinct semantic signals not present
in raw text. We thus focus our experiments on an-
swering the following questions:
1. How is language that is inserted during edit-
ing different from general Wikipedia text?
2. What can we learn about language by observ-
ing the editing process that we cannot readily
learn by observing only the ﬁnal edited text?
Speciﬁcally, the contributions of this paper are:
• A new corpus (WikiAtomicEdits) of 26M
atomic insertions and 17M atomic deletions
covering 8 languages (§3 and §4):
http:
//goo.gl/language/wiki-atomic-edits.
• Linguistic analysis showing that inserted lan-
guage differs measurably from the language
observed in general Wikipedia text (§5).

• Language modeling experiments showing
that models trained on WikiAtomicEdits en-
code different aspects of semantics and dis-
course than models trained on raw, unstruc-
tured text (§6).

Theoretical Motivation
We borrow the idea of an atomic edit from
prior work in natural language inference, specif-
ically natural logic (Lakoff, 1970; Van Benthem,
1986).
MacCartney (2009) deﬁnes an atomic
edit e applied to a natural language expression
s as the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a
sub-expression p such that both the original ex-
pression s and the resulting expression e(s) are
well-formed semantic constituents.
E.g.
s =
“She died from an illness”, p = “in 1949”, and
e(s) = “She died in 1949 from an illness”. This
formulation is desirable because it exposes a rela-
tionship between the surface form and the seman-
tics of natural language while remaining agnos-
tic about the underlying semantic representation.
That is, the difference in “meaning” between s and
e(s) is exactly the “meaning” of p (in context), re-
gardless of how that meaning is represented.
We adopt this philosophy in creating our cor-
pus. We focus our analysis speciﬁcally on atomic
insertion edits. We make the assumption that edi-
tors on Wikipedia are attempting to communicate
true information1 and to do so effectively. Inser-
tion edits are thus particularly interesting because
the underlying generation process admits the fol-
lowing assumptions:
1. The original sentence s does not effectively
communicate some piece of information.
2. A reasonable reader of s would like/expect
this information to be communicated.
3. This information is communicated by the in-
serted phrase p (in the context of e(s)).
We therefore believe that the supervision provided
by insertion edits can improve our understanding
of semantics, discourse, and composition, and that
the data released will be valuable for research in
these areas. The goal of our experiments is to es-
tablish that the signal provided in these edits is
distinct from what one could easily obtain given
currently available text corpora.
1This is true for the majority of edits, although about
13% of edits are “spam” (§4.3).

WikiAtomicEdits: Corpus Creation
3.1
Extracting Edits
Wikipedia
edits
can
be
accessed
through
Wikipedia dumps.
The edits are stored as
diffs on the entire Wikipedia page, meaning some
processing is required to reconstruct the changes
that were made at the sentence level.
We use
historical snapshots of each Wikipedia document
and compare against subsequent snapshots to
extract sentence-level edits. We strip the HTML
tags and Wikipedia markup of the page and then
run a sentence splitter (Gillick, 2009) to obtain a
list of sentences for each snapshot. Rather than
run a full, quadratic-time (Myers, 1986) sequence
alignment to compare the two lists of sentences,
which is infeasible for long articles, we propose
an efﬁcient precision-oriented approximation.
Given n sentences in one snapshot (“base”) and
m sentences in a subsequent one (“edited”), we
assume that most edits are local and restrict our
attention to a ﬁxed-size window. For each sen-
tence si in the base snapshot, we compute pairwise
BLEU scores (Papineni et al., 2002) between si
and the sentences {tj}i+k
j=i−k (k = 5) in the edited
snapshot. We consider the sentence with the high-
est BLEU score in this window as a candidate. If
the sentences are not identical and the difference
consists of an insertion or deletion of a single con-
tiguous phrase2, we add this example to the cor-
pus. For each article, we run this algorithm over
the most recent 100,000 snapshots as of February
2018. We extract edits for 8 languages. Statistics
are shown in Table 2.
2We use the Python 2.7 difflib library to compute a
minimal diff at the byte level.

3.2
Insertions vs. Deletions
We use the algorithm described above to extract
both atomic insertions and atomic deletions. How-
ever, we chose to omit the deletions from our lin-
guistic (§5) and language modeling (§6) analyses
for two reasons. First, our intuition is that spans
which are deleted by an editor are more likely to
be “bad” phrases (e.g. spam, false information,
or grammatical errors introduced by a previous
editor). To conﬁrm this, we manually inspected
100 of each type of edit. We found that indeed
deletions contained a higher proportion of spam
text and malformed English (16/100) than did in-
sertions (7/100). Second, while insertions permit
a clean set of assumptions about the relationship
between the original sentence and the edited sen-
tence (§2), it is more difﬁcult to make generaliza-
tions about deletions. Speciﬁcally, it is difﬁcult
to say whether the original sentence should not
communicate the information in the deleted phrase
(i.e. the phrase contains false, irrelevant, or oth-
erwise erroneous information) or rather the origi-
nal sentence/surrounding context already commu-
nicates the information in the deleted phrase (i.e.
the deleted phrase is redundant). As such, dele-
tions are a noisier target for analysis. Nonetheless,
we recognize that the deletions provide a related
and likely useful signal. We thus include deletions
in our corpus but leave their deeper linguistic anal-
ysis for future work.

Corpus Quality & Reproducibility
4.1
Annotation
Given the data collected as above, we now in-
vestigate whether the extracted edits are sufﬁ-
ciently clean to be useful for computational lan-
guage analysis and modeling. To do this, we focus
our attention speciﬁcally on the English, Spanish,
and German subcorpora, as these are languages for
which we could ﬁnd a sufﬁcient number of native
speakers to perform the necessary annotation for
our analysis. Thus, the discussion and results in
this section may not be representative of the other
languages in the corpus.
We are interested speciﬁcally in two questions.
First, we want to measure the overall corpus qual-
ity: how many of the inserted phrases represent
meaningful edits and how many are simply noise
(e.g. from editor or preprocessing error)? Second,
we want to understand, at least in part, the repro-
ducibility of the corpus: could we expect a differ-

ent group of human editors to produce the same
edits as those observed?
To address these questions, we collect annota-
tions in a semi-generative manner. Each annotator
is shown a sentence s and a phrase p to be inserted,
and is asked to insert p into s in order to form
a new sentence e(s). If s is not a complete and
well-formed sentence, or if there is no location at
which p can be inserted such that e(s) would be
a complete and well-formed sentence, annotators
are instructed to mark the edit as an error. We use
the “error” labels in order to study corpus quality
(§4.2) and use the annotators’ insertion location to
estimate reproducibility (§4.3).
We collect labels for 5,000 English edits, and
1,000 each for Spanish and German edits using a
crowd-sourcing platform. We collect 5-way an-
notations for English and 3-way annotations for
Spanish and German. Our choices of languages
and the differing levels of redundancy were due to
availability of annotators. We will release these
7,000 edits and their annotations with the corpus.
4.2
Corpus Quality
To measure corpus quality, we compute the pro-
portion of edits marked as errors by our annota-
tors. Table 3 shows our results. For English, in
78% of cases our annotators agreed unanimously
that p could be inserted meaningfully into s (55%
for Spanish; 85% for German). These numbers re-
assure us that, while there is some noise, the ma-
jority of the corpus represents legitimate edits with
meaningful signal. For more discussion of the er-
rors refer to Supplementary Material.
4.3
Agreement and Ambiguity
We next explore the extent to which the edits in
the corpus are reproducible. In an ideal world, we
would like to answer the question: given the same
original sentences, would a different group of hu-

man editors produce the same edits? Answering
this directly would require annotators with domain
expertise and is infeasible in practice. However,
we can use our crowdsourced annotation to an-
swer a restricted variant of this question: given a
sentence s and an insertable phrase p, do humans
agree on where p belongs in s? We can measure
agreement in this setting straightforwardly using
exact match, and can interpret human performance
as that of a “perfect” language model. I.e. we
can interpret disagreement as evidence that repro-
ducing the particular edit is dependent on exoge-
nous information not available in the language of s
alone (e.g. knowledge of the underlying facts be-
ing discussed, or of the author’s individual style).
Based on our annotation experiment, we ﬁnd
that individual annotators agree with the original
editor 66% of the time for English, 72% for Span-
ish, and 85% for German.3 More interesting than
how often humans disagree on this task, however,
is why they disagree. To better understand this, we
take a sample of 100 English sentences in which
at least one human annotator disagreed with the
original editor and no annotator marked the edit
as an error. We then manually inspect the sample
and record whether or not the annotators’ choices
of different insertion points give rise to sentences
with different semantic meaning or simply to sen-
tences with different discourse structure.
In particular, we consider three categories for
the observed disagreements: 1) the sentences are
meaning equivalent from a truth-conditional per-
spective, 2) the sentences contain signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in meaning from a truth-conditional per-
spective, or 3) the sentences contain minor dif-
ferences or ambiguities in meaning (but would
likely be considered equivalent from the point of
view of most readers). We also include an error
category, for when the disagreement stems from
a single annotator making an erroneous choice.
Examples of each category are given in Table 4.
Note that the assessment of the truth conditions of
the sentence and their equivalence is based on our
judgment, and many of these judgments are sub-
jective. We will release our annotations for this
analysis with the corpus, to enable reproducibility
and reﬁnement in future research.

fected discourse structure only), and 22% to have
signiﬁcant differences in meaning (i.e. the edit’s
location fundamentally changed the meaning of
the sentence). An additional 13% exhibited mi-
nor differences or ambiguities in meaning, and in
the remaining 16% of cases, the disagreement ap-
peared to be due to annotator error.

Corpus Linguistic Analysis
We now turn our attention to exploring the lan-
guage in the corpus itself. In this section and in
§6, our focus is on the questions put forth in the
introduction: 1) how does the language that is in-
serted during editing differ from language that is
observed in general? and 2) what can we learn
about language by observing the editing process
that we cannot readily learn by observing only raw
text? Here, we explore these questions from a cor-
pus linguistics perspective. The analysis in this
section is based predominantly on the 14M inser-
tion edits from the English subcorpus (Table 2).
5.1
Manual Categorization of Insertions
We ﬁrst characterize the types of insertions in
terms of the function they serve.
Manually in-
specting the edits, we identify four high-level cate-
gories. Note that we do not intend these categories
to be formal or exhaustive, but rather to be illus-
trative of the types of semantic and discourse phe-
nomena in the corpus: i.e. to give sense of the bal-
ance between semantic, pragmatic, and grammati-
cal edits in the corpus. The categories we identify
are as follows:
1. Extension: the explicit addition of new infor-
mation that the author of the original sentence
did not intend to communicate.4
2. Reﬁnement: the addition of information that
the author of the original sentence either in-
tended to communicate or assumed the reader
would already know. This category includes
hedges, non-restrictive modiﬁers, and other
clariﬁcations or scoping-down of claims.
3. Fluency / Discourse: grammatical ﬁxes, as
well as the insertion of discourse connectives
(“thus”), presuppositions (“also”), and edi-
torializations (“very”).
4Whether or not the author “intended” to communicate
something is based on our judgment. Since this annotation is
intended to be exploratory, we allow a degree of informality.

4. Referring Expressions (RE): changes in the
name of an entity that do not change the un-
derlying referent, such as adding a ﬁrst name
(“Andrew”) or a title (“Dr.”). RE edits could
fall within our deﬁnition of “reﬁnement”, but
because they are especially prevalent we an-
notate them as a separate category.
We also deﬁne an Error category for spam, van-
dalism, and other “mistake” edits.
We manually categorize 100 randomly-sampled
edits.
The breakdown is shown in Table 6.
In
our sample, the majority (43%) were extensions,
and the second most frequent where reﬁnements
(24%). No single category dominates and all are
well-represented, suggesting that a variety of phe-
nomena can be studied using this corpus.
5.2
Comparing Insertions to Raw Text
Understanding the high-level functions of edits, as
above, provides some insight into the type of lin-
guistic signals contained in the data.
However,
we are particularly interested in whether the lan-
guage used for these functions is noticeably dif-
ferent from general Wikipedia text. That is: it is
not obvious that the language humans use to e.g.
extend or reﬁne an existing claim should necessar-
ily be different, in aggregate, from the language
used to formulate these claims in general. We thus
explore whether this is the case.
We ﬁrst compare the distribution of parts of
speech observed for the inserted phrases to the
distribution of parts of speech that we observe in
Wikipedia overall–i.e.
in the sentences appear-
ing in the ﬁnal, published version of Wikipedia,
not only the edit history. In order to compare the
relative frequencies in a straightforward way, we
look only at edits in which a single word was in-
serted.5 Figure 1 shows our results for English,
Spanish, and German. We see, for example, that
in English, adjectives and adverbs combined make
up nearly 30% of all inserted words, three and
a half times higher than the frequency of adjec-
tives/adverbs observed in the general Wikipedia
corpus, and that proper nouns are inserted at a
higher rate than would be suggested given their
base frequency.
Looking more carefully, we see that the nature
of the edits for each part of speech are qualita-
tively different as well. To explore this further,
we look at which words appear at substantially
higher rate as insertions than they do in the gen-
eral Wikipedia corpus. We compute this as fol-
lows: for a word w with part of speech pos, we
compute the number of times w occurs as an in-
sertion per thousand insertions of any word of type
pos, and compare this to the rate of occurrence of
w per thousand occurrences of any word of type
pos within the general Wikipedia corpus. Table 7
shows our results for English (Spanish and Ger-
man are given in the Supplementary Material). In
particular, we see that many words which are in-
serted at a signiﬁcantly higher-than-baseline rate
reﬂect “reﬁnement”-type edits. Many of these are
words which the original author may have commu-
5In our corpus 30% of inserted phrases are a single word,
and 70% are less than ﬁve words. We compared frequencies
for longer POS sequences as well, but it did not yield partic-
ular insight over looking at single POS tags.

nicated implicitly but the editor chose to state ex-
plicitly, such as whether or not a person is a “cur-
rent”/“former” public ﬁgure6 or is “famous”. On
the other hand, words which are inserted at a sig-
niﬁcantly lower-than-baseline rate are those which
would be unlikely to be omitted by the original
author. For example, if an event is famously the
“ﬁrst” or the “only” one of its kind, it is highly
unlikely for the original author describing that
event not to use these words explicitly.

Language Modeling Analysis
We next explore the corpus from a language mod-
eling perspective. Again, we are interested in un-
derstanding how the signal captured by the editing
process is distinct from that captured by the ﬁnal
edited text alone, and in characterizing the types of
signals we can learn from modeling the insertions
directly. We investigate this through two tasks:
ﬁrst, given a sentence s and insertable phrase p,
predict the index i at which p should appear in s
(§6.1), and second, given a sentence s and an index
i, generate candidate phrases that would be appro-
priate to insert into s at i (§6.2).
6We note that the addition of “former” is likely tied to
changes in the real world (Wijaya et al., 2015).

6.1
Predicting Insertion Locations
Task.
This task–given a phrase p and a sentence
s, choose the best index i in s at which to in-
sert p–is identical to the task we asked humans to
perform in §4. We consider two simple models
for performing this task: a basic language model
and a discriminative model trained on the insertion
data. We report performance as overall accuracy.
We analyze whether a model which is trained to

model insertions directly captures something dif-
ferent than a general language model in terms of
the types of errors each model makes.
Models.
We evaluate two models.
First, we
evaluate a standard language modeling baseline
(General LM), in which we simply insert the
phrase p at every possible point in s and chose
the index which yields the lowest perplexity. We
use the LSTM language model from Jozefowicz
et al. (2016), which obtained SOTA results on lan-
guage modeling on the one billion words bench-
mark for English (Chelba et al., 2013). We train
this language model for each language on an aver-
age of ∼500 million tokens from Wikipedia. Sec-
ond, we evaluate a discriminative model speciﬁ-
cally trained on the insertion data (Discriminative
Model). This model represents the base sentence
using a sentence encoder that produces a context-
dependent representation of every word index in
the sentence, and then at test time, compares the
learned representation of each index with the rep-
resentation of the phrase p to be inserted. We use a
256-dimensional 2-layer biLSTM encoder, initial-
ized with FastText 300-dimensional word vectors
(Mikolov et al., 2018; Grave et al., 2018).7 We
hold out 50K and 10K insertion edits for each lan-
guage as development and test sets, and use the re-
maining edits (insertions and deletions) as training
data. This provides us with at least 1 million ex-
amples for training in each language (cf. Table 2).
See Supplementary Material for additional details.
Results.
Table 8 shows the accuracy of each
model for each language. We see that the discri-
minitve model trained on insertions directly per-
forms better than the general LM by at least 1%
absolute accuracy on every language, and by 3.8%
absolute on average. It is worth emphasizing that
this performance improvement is despite the fact
that the general LM was trained with, on average,
four times the number of tokens8 and is a much
larger model–the general LM has ∼2 billion pa-
rameters (Jozefowicz et al., 2016) compared to ∼
1 million for the discriminative model.
More interesting than raw performance is the
difference in the types of errors that the models

make. For each model, we take a random sample
of 50 examples on which the model made a correct
prediction and 50 examples on which the model
made an incorrect prediction. We annotate these
200 examples9 according to the edit type classi-
ﬁcation discussed in §5.1. Table 9 shows the re-
sults. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant difference10 (p < 0.01)
between the types of edits on which the General
LM makes correct predictions and the types on
which it makes incorrect predictions. Speciﬁcally,
the General LM appears to be especially good at
predicting location for ﬂuency/discourse edits, and
especially poor at predicting the location of reﬁne-
ment edits. In contrast, we do not see any sig-
niﬁcant bias in the errors made by the discrimi-
native model compared to its correct predictions
(p = 0.23). We interpret this as evidence that the
insertion data captures some semantic signal that
is not readily gleaned from raw text corpora.

Predicting Insertion Phrases
Task.
In a ﬁnal set of experiments, we explore a
generative version of the language modeling task:
given a sentence s and an speciﬁed index i, gener-
ate a phrase p which would be appropriate to insert
into s at i. We are interested in what such a model
can learn about the nature of how sentences are
extended: what type of information would be rele-
vant from a semantic perspective, and natural from
a discourse perspective to insert at a given point?
We train two models for this task, one trained on
the training split of the WikiAtomicEdits corpus,
and one baseline trained on a comparable set of
phrasal insertions not derived from human edits.
We evaluate on the same 10K held-out insertion
9To avoid bias, the 200 examples are shufﬂed and the
annotator does not know which group (correct/incorrect, or
which model) each example belongs to.
10We use the chi-squared test provided by scipy.stats.

edits as in §6.1, and measure performance using
both a strict “exact match” as well as a softer sim-
ilarity metric.
Model.
We
use
an
standard
sequence-to-
sequence model (Sutskever et al., 2014), modi-
fying the input with a special token denoting the
insertion point. For example, given the input [“
Angel ” is a song recorded by <ins> pop music
duo Eurythmics .], the model would be trained to
produce the target phrase [the British]. We use
a two-layer bidirectional encoder using the same
300-dimensional FastText embeddings as in §6.1,
and a sequence decoder with attention (Bahdanau
et al., 2015) using a learned wordpiece model
(Schuster and Nakajima, 2012) with a vocabulary
of 16,000.
Experimental Design.
We train one version of
this model on the same set of 23M English ex-
amples as the discriminative insertion model from
§6.1; we refer to the model trained on this data
as Edits. For comparison, we train an identical
model on a set of simulated insertions which we
create by sampling sentences from Wikipedia and
removing contiguous spans of tokens, which we
then treat as the insertion phrases. To ensure that
this data is reasonably comparable to the Wiki-
AtomicEdits data, we parse the sampled sentences
(Andor et al., 2016) and only remove a span if it
represents a full subtree of the dependency parse
and is not the subject of the sentence.11 We gener-
ate 23M such “psuedo-edits” for training, the same
11Not all of the inserted phrases in WikiAtomicEdits are
well-formed constituents. However, generating psuedo-edits
using this heuristic provided a cleaner, more realistic compar-
ison than using fully-random spans.
size as the WikiAtomicEdits training set. We refer
to the model trained on this data as General.
Results.
We look at the top 10 phrases proposed
by each model, as decoded by beam search. In
addition to reporting standard LM perplexity, we
compute two measures of performance, which are
intended to provide an intuitive picture of how
well each model captures the nature of the infor-
mation that is introduced by the human editors.
Speciﬁcally, we compute Exact Match as the pro-
portion of sentences for which the model produced
the gold phrase (i.e. the phrase inserted by the hu-
man editor) somewhere among the top 10 phrases.
We also compute Similarity@1 as the mean co-
sine similarity of each top-ranked phrase and re-
spective gold phrase over the test set. We use the
sum of the Glove embeddings (Pennington et al.,
2014) of each word in the phrase as a simple ap-
proximation of the phrase vector.
Table 11 shows the results. We see that, com-
pared to the model trained on General Wikipedia,
the model trained on WikiAtomicEdits generates
edits which are more similar to the human inser-
tions, according to all of our metrics. Table 10
provides a few qualitative examples of how the
phrases generated by the Edits model differ from
those generated by the General model. Speciﬁ-
cally, we see that the Edits model proposes phrases
which better capture the discourse function of the
human edit: e.g. providing context for/elaboration
on a previously-stated fact. We note that this does
not mean that training on Edits is inherently “bet-
ter” than on General text, but rather that the su-
pervision encoded by the WikiAtomicEdits corpus
encodes aspects of language that are distinct from
those easily learned from existing resources.

Wikipedia Edits.
Wikipedia edit history has
been used as a source of supervision for a vari-
ety of NLP tasks, including sentence compression
and simpliﬁcation (Yamangil and Nelken, 2008;
Yatskar et al., 2010), paraphrasing (Max and Wis-
niewski, 2010), entailment (Zanzotto and Pennac-
chiotti, 2010; Cabrio et al., 2012), and writing as-
sistance (Zesch, 2012; Cahill et al., 2013; Grund-
kiewicz and Junczys-Dowmunt, 2014). User ed-
its from Wikipedia and elsewhere have also been
analyzed extensively for insight into the editing
process and the types of edits made (Daxenberger
and Gurevych, 2012, 2013; Yang et al., 2017)

and to better understand argumentation (Tan and
Lee, 2014). Particular attention has been given to
spam edits (Adler et al., 2011) and editor quality
(Leskovec et al., 2010). Our work differs in that
WikiAtomicEdits is much larger than currently
available corpora, both by number of languages
and by size of individual languages. In addition,
our focus on atomic edits should facilitate more
controlled studies of semantics and discourse.
Sentence Representation and Generation.
We
view the WikiAtomicEdits corpus as being espe-
cially valuable for ongoing work in sentence rep-
resentation and generation, which requires models
of what “good” sentences look like and how they
are constructed.
Recent work has attempted to
model sentence generation by re-writing existing
sentences, either using crowdsourced edit exam-
ples (Narayan et al., 2017) or unsupervised heuris-
tics (Guu et al., 2018); in contrast, we provide a
large corpus of natural, human-produced edits.
Also related is recent work in sentence rep-
resentation learning from raw text (Kiros et al.,
2015; Peters et al., 2018), bitext (McCann et al.,
2017), and other supervised tasks including NLI
(Conneau et al., 2017). Especially related is work
on learning representations from weakly-labelled
discourse relations (Nie et al., 2017; Jernite et al.,
2017), as the WikiAtomicEdits corpus captures
similar types of discourse signal.
Description of Data Release
Our full corpus is available for download at http:
//goo.gl/language/wiki-atomic-edits.
The
data contains 26M atomic insertions and 17M
atomic deletions covering 8 languages. All sen-
tences (both the original sentence s, and the edited
sentence e(s)) have been POS-tagged and depen-
dency parsed (Andor et al., 2016) as well as scored
using a SOTA LM (Jozefowicz et al., 2016). We
also release the 5K 5-way human insertion annota-
tions for English, and 1K 3-way annotations each
for Spanish and German, as described in §4.

Conclusion
We have introduced the WikiAtomicEdits corpus,
derived from Wikipedia’s edit history, which con-
tains 43M examples of atomic insertions and dele-
tions in 8 languages. We have shown that the lan-
guage in this corpus is meaningfully different from
the language we observe in general, and that mod-
els trained on this corpus encode different aspects
of semantics and discourse than models trained on
raw text. These results suggest that the corpus will
be valuable to ongoing research in semantics, dis-
course, and representation learning.
